On the use of external information in social network analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0080-5,JUL 2011,21,2,"Network analysis focuses on links among interacting units (actors). Interactions are often derived from the presence of actors at events or activities (two-mode network) and this information is coded and arranged in a typical affiliation matrix. In addition to the relational data, interest may focus on external information gathered on both actors and events. Our aim is to explore the effect of external information on the formation of ties by setting a strategy able to decompose the original affiliation matrix by linear combinations of data vectors representing external information with a suitable matrix of coefficients. This allows to obtain peculiar relational data matrices that include the effect of external information. The derived adjacency matrices can then be analyzed from the network analysis perspective. In particular, we look for groups of structurally equivalent actors obtained through clustering methods. Illustrative examples and a real dataset in the framework of scientific collaboration will give a major insight into the proposed strategy.","Attribute data,Clustering,Positional analysis,Scientific collaboration network,Two-mode network","RESEARCH COLLABORATION,POSITIONS","Giordano, Giuseppe@Univ Salerno, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy::Vitale, Maria Prosperina@Univ Salerno, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy","Giordano, Giuseppe@University of Salerno::Vitale, Maria Prosperina@University of Salerno",not exist,"no title+BANET TA+B TECHNIQUE CTR STAT+1985::Analyse factorielle lissee et analyse des differences locales+Benali, H.; Escofier, B.+Revue de Statistique Appliquee+1990::POSITIONS IN NETWORKS+BURT, RS+SOCIAL FORCES+1976::sna: Tools for Social Network Analysis+Butts, CT.+R package version 2.3-2+2010::no title+Davis, Allison; Gardner, Burleigh Bradford; Gardner, Mary R.+Deep South: A Social Anthropological Study of Caste and Class+1941::no title+DESTEFANO D+BOOK SHORT PAPERS CL+2009::CLUSTERING WITH RELATIONAL CONSTRAINT+FERLIGOJ, A; BATAGELJ, V+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1982::no title+GIORDANO G+STAT APPL+2007::no title+Glanzel, W; Schubert, A.+HDB QUANTITATIVE SCI+2005::What is research collaboration?+Katz, JS; Martin, BR+RESEARCH POLICY+MAR 1997::Friendship as a social process: A substantive and methodological analysis+Lazarsfeld, PF; Merton, RK.+Freedom and Control in Modern Society+1954::no title+LEBART L+ANAL STAT CONTIGUITE+1969::Birds of a feather: Homophily in social networks+McPherson, M; Smith-Lovin, L; Cook, JM+ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY+2001::Studying research collaboration using co-authorships+Melin, G; Persson, O+SCIENTOMETRICS+JUL-AUG 1996::An introduction to exponential random graph (p*) models for social networks+Robins, Garry; Pattison, Pip; Kalish, Yuval; et al.+SOCIAL NETWORKS+MAY 2007::no title+Rogers, E.+Diffusion of innovation+2003::no title+Searle, S.

Fast algorithms for determining (generalized) core groups in social networks,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0079-y,JUL 2011,22,48,"The structure of a large network (graph) can often be revealed by partitioning it into smaller and possibly more dense sub-networks that are easier to handle. One of such decompositions is based on ""k-cores"", proposed in 1983 by Seidman. Together with connectivity components, cores are one among few concepts that provide efficient decompositions of large graphs and networks. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for determining the cores decomposition of a given network with complexity O(m), where m is the number of lines (edges or arcs). In the second part of the paper the classical concept of k-core is generalized in a way that uses a vertex property function instead of degree of a vertex. For local monotone vertex property functions the corresponding generalized cores can be determined in O(m.max(Delta, log n)) time, where n is the number of vertices and Delta is the maximum degree. Finally the proposed algorithms are illustrated by the analysis of a collaboration network in the field of computational geometry.","Core,Large network,Decomposition,Graph algorithm","K-CORE,GRAPHS","Batagelj, Vladimir@Univ Ljubljana, FMF, Dept Math, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia::Zaversnik, Matjaz@Univ Ljubljana, FMF, Dept Math, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Batagelj, Vladimir@University of Ljubljana::Zaversnik, Matjaz@University of Ljubljana","Batagelj, Vladimir@B-9105-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0240-9446","Visualisation and analysis of the internet movie database+Ahmed, A.; Batagelj, V.; Fu, X.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Hong, S.

Assessing and accounting for time heterogeneity in stochastic actor oriented models,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0076-1,JUL 2011,40,24,"This paper explores time heterogeneity in stochastic actor oriented models (SAOM) proposed by Snijders (Sociological methodology. Blackwell, Boston, pp 361-395, 2001) which are meant to study the evolution of networks. SAOMs model social networks as directed graphs with nodes representing people, organizations, etc., and dichotomous relations representing underlying relationships of friendship, advice, etc. We illustrate several reasons why heterogeneity should be statistically tested and provide a fast, convenient method for assessment and model correction. SAOMs provide a flexible framework for network dynamics which allow a researcher to test selection, influence, behavioral, and structural properties in network data over time. We show how the forward-selecting, score type test proposed by Schweinberger (Chapter 4: Statistical modeling of network panel data: goodness of fit. PhD thesis, University of Groningen 2007) can be employed to quickly assess heterogeneity at almost no additional computational cost. One step estimates are used to assess the magnitude of the heterogeneity. Simulation studies are conducted to support the validity of this approach. The ASSIST dataset (Campbell et al. In Lancet 371(9624):1595-1602, 2008) is reanalyzed with the score type test, one step estimators, and a full estimation for illustration. These tools are implemented in the RSiena package, and a brief walkthrough is provided.","Stochastic actor oriented models,Longitudinal analysis of network data,Time heterogeneity,Score-type test","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,SPECIFICATION ERROR,NETWORKS,SMOKING","Lospinoso, Joshua A.@Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England@US Mil Acad, Network Sci Ctr, New York, NY USA::Schweinberger, Michael@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Snijders, Tom A.

Robust estimation of efficient mean-variance frontiers,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0082-3,APR 2011,21,3,"Standard methods for optimal allocation of shares in a financial portfolio are determined by second-order conditions which are very sensitive to outliers. The well-known Markowitz approach, which is based on the input of a mean vector and a covariance matrix, seems to provide questionable results in financial management, since small changes of inputs might lead to irrelevant portfolio allocations. However, existing robust estimators often suffer from masking of multiple influential observations, so we propose a new robust estimator which suitably weights data using a forward search approach. A Monte Carlo simulation study and an application to real data show some advantages of the proposed approach.","Efficient frontiers,Forward search,Multivariate outlier detection,Portfolio allocation","PORTFOLIO SELECTION,OUTLIERS","Grossi, Luigi@Univ Verona, I-37129 Verona, Italy::Laurini, Fabrizio@Univ Parma, I-43100 Parma, Italy","Grossi, Luigi@University of Verona::Laurini, Fabrizio@University of Parma","GROSSI, Luigi@L-9412-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3671-7348","Economic implications of using a mean-VaR model for portfolio selection: A comparison with mean-variance analysis+Alexander, GJ; Baptista, AM+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+JUL 2002::FAST VERY ROBUST METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF MULTIPLE OUTLIERS+ATKINSON, AC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1994::no title+Atkinson, AC; Riani, M.+Robust diagnostic regression analysis+2000::no title+ATKINSON AC+SPR S STAT+2004::The forward search: Theory and data analysis+Atkinson, Anthony C.; Riani, Marco; Cerioli, Andrea+JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN STATISTICAL SOCIETY+JUN 2010::Computing efficient frontiers using estimated parameters+Broadie, M.+Annals of Operations Research+Dec. 1993::Portfolio Selection with Robust Estimation+DeMiguel, Victor; Nogales, Francisco J.+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+MAY-JUN 2009::no title+Fabozzi, F.

Constrained principal component analysis of standardized data for biplots with unit-length variable vectors,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0081-4,APR 2011,19,2,"Principal component analysis (PCA) of an objects x variables data matrix is used for obtaining a low-dimensional biplot configuration, where data are approximated by the inner products of the vectors corresponding to objects and variables. Borg and Groenen (Modern multidimensional scaling. Springer, New York, 1997) have suggested another biplot procedure which uses a technique for approximating data by projections of object vectors on variable vectors. This technique is formulated as constraining the variable vectors in PCA to be of unit length and can be called unit-length vector analysis (UVA). However, an algorithm for UVA has not yet been developed. In this paper, we present such an algorithm, discuss the properties of UVA solutions, and demonstrate the advantage of UVA in biplots for standardized data with homogeneous variances among variables. The advantage of UVA-based biplots is that the projections of object vectors onto variable vectors express the approximation of data in an easy way, while in PCA-based biplots we must consider not only the projections, but also the lengths of variable vectors in order to visualize approximations.","Biplots,Unit-length vector analysis,Principal component analysis,Inner product,Projection","OBLIQUE PROCRUSTES ROTATION,MATRICES","Adachi, Kohei@Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Human Sci, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Adachi, Kohei@Osaka University",not exist,"SCALAR PRODUCT MODEL FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING OF CHOICE+BECHTEL, GG; TUCKER, LR; CHANG, WC+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1971::no title+Borg, I.; Groenen, P.+Modern Multidimensional Scaling, Theory and Applications+1997::ON OBLIQUE PROCRUSTES ROTATION+BROWNE, MW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1967::no title+Cox, Trevor F.; Cox, M.A.A.+Multidimensional Scaling+2001::ON BROWNES SOLUTION FOR OBLIQUE PROCRUSTES ROTATION+CRAMER, EM+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1974::no title+FLURY B+COMMON COMPONENT ANA+1988::BIPLOT GRAPHIC DISPLAY OF MATRICES WITH APPLICATION TO PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS+GABRIEL, KR+BIOMETRIKA+1971::Area Biplots+Gower, J.

Detection of multivariate outliers in business survey data with incomplete information,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0075-2,APR 2011,55,8,"Many different methods for statistical data editing can be found in the literature but only few of them are based on robust estimates (for example such as BACON-EEM, epidemic algorithms (EA) and transformed rank correlation (TRC) methods of B,guin and Hulliger). However, we can show that outlier detection is only reasonable if robust methods are applied, because the classical estimates are themselves influenced by the outliers. Nevertheless, data editing is essential to check the multivariate data for possible data problems and it is not deterministic like the traditional micro editing where all records are extensively edited manually using certain rules/constraints. The presence of missing values is more a rule than an exception in business surveys and poses additional severe challenges to the outlier detection. First we review the available multivariate outlier detection methods which can cope with incomplete data. In a simulation study, where a subset of the Austrian Structural Business Statistics is simulated, we compare several approaches. Robust methods based on the Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator, S-estimators and OGK-estimator as well as BACON-BEM provide the best results in finding the outliers and in providing a low false discovery rate.

A fast convergent algorithm was developed for GIPSCAL with acceleration by the minimal polynomial extrapolation. The proposed algorithm was compared with Trendafilov's algorithm in computational speed.

Fuzzy clusterwise quasi-likelihood generalized linear models,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0069-0,DEC 2010,48,1,"The quasi-likelihood method has emerged as a useful approach to the parameter estimation of generalized linear models (GLM) in circumstances where there is insufficient distributional information to construct a likelihood function. Despite its flexibility, the quasi-likelihood approach to GLM is currently designed for an aggregate-sample analysis based on the assumption that the entire sample of observations is taken from a single homogenous population. Thus, this approach may not be suitable when heterogeneous subgroups exist in the population, which involve qualitatively distinct effects of covariates on the response variable. In this paper, the quasi-likelihood GLM approach is generalized to a fuzzy clustering framework which explicitly accounts for such cluster-level heterogeneity. A simple iterative estimation algorithm is presented to optimize the regularized fuzzy clustering criterion of the proposed method. The performance of the proposed method in recovering parameters is investigated based on a Monte Carlo analysis involving synthetic data. Finally, the empirical usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated through an application to actual data on the coupon usage behaviour of a sample of consumers.","Generalized linear models,Quasi-likelihood,Fuzzy clustering,Regularization by entropy,Cluster-level heterogeneity,Coupon redemption","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,HETEROGENEITY,REGRESSION,ALGORITHM,TAXONOMY,BEHAVIOR,SETS","Hwang, Heungsun@McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada::Tomiuk, Marc A.@HEC Montreal, Dept Mkt, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada","Hwang, Heungsun@McGill University::Tomiuk, Marc A.@University of Montreal@HEC Montreal",not exist,"Cluster analysis and marketing research+Arabie, P.; Hubert, L.+Advanced Methods in Marketing Research+1994::A FIELD INVESTIGATION OF CAUSAL RELATIONS AMONG COGNITIONS, AFFECT, INTENTIONS, AND BEHAVIOR+BAGOZZI, RP+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+1982::ANALYZING INCREMENTAL SALES FROM A DIRECT MAIL COUPON PROMOTION+BAWA, K; SHOEMAKER, RW+JOURNAL OF MARKETING+JUL 1989::Cluster validity with fuzzy sets+Bezdek, J.C.+Journal of Cybernetics+July-Sept. 1973::no title+Bezdek, J.

Inequalities between multi-rater kappas,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0073-4,DEC 2010,46,80,"The paper presents inequalities between four descriptive statistics that have been used to measure the nominal agreement between two or more raters. Each of the four statistics is a function of the pairwise information. Light's kappa and Hubert's kappa are multi-rater versions of Cohen's kappa. Fleiss' kappa is a multi-rater extension of Scott's pi, whereas Randolph's kappa generalizes Bennett et al. S to multiple raters. While a consistent ordering between the numerical values of these agreement measures has frequently been observed in practice, there is thus far no theoretical proof of a general ordering inequality among these measures. It is proved that Fleiss' kappa is a lower bound of Hubert's kappa and Randolph's kappa, and that Randolph's kappa is an upper bound of Hubert's kappa and Light's kappa if all pairwise agreement tables are weakly marginal symmetric or if all raters assign a certain minimum proportion of the objects to a specified category.","Nominal agreement,Cohen's kappa,Scott's pi,Light's kappa,Hubert's kappa,Fleiss' kappa,Randolph's kappa,Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,Arithmetic-harmonic means inequality","NOMINAL SCALE AGREEMENT,INTERRATER AGREEMENT,RESEMBLANCE MEASURES,WEIGHTED KAPPA,COEFFICIENT,RELIABILITY,TABLES,INDEX,ASSOCIATION,EXTENSION","Warrens, Matthijs J.@Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, Unit Methodol & Stat, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands","Warrens, Matthijs J.@Leiden University",not exist,"no title+ARTSTEIN R+051 NLE U ESS+2005::Beyond kappa: A review of interrater agreement measures+Banerjee, M+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1999::Communications through limited questioning+Bennett, E.

Detecting atypical observations in financial data: the forward search for elliptical copulas,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0072-5,DEC 2010,14,6,"In the last few years, copulas have been widely applied in many field of studies. Concentrating our attention on financial applications, we pursue the goal to detect multivariate atypical observations by extending to elliptical copulas the forward search originally introduced in linear and nonlinear regression by Atkinson and Riani (Robust diagnostic regression analysis. Springer, New York, 2000). Considering that, in the forward search, observations are ranked according to their closeness to the fitted data, we need to define a measure through which to initialize, progress and monitor the search. We achieve this goal building up the forward search for elliptical copulas relying on the squared Mahalanobis distance. Stressing the need to find theoretical boundaries for the inference on outliers, we introduce a procedure for computing envelopes as in Riani and Atkinson (Adv Data Anal Classif 1:123-141, 2007). Once defined our framework, we apply the forward search to a simulated environment where contaminations are exogenously introduced then, we carry out the analysis on n equity log-return real time series.","Copulas,Forward search,Squared Mahalanobis distance",,"Bellini, Tiziano@Univ Parma, Dipartimento Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy","Bellini, Tiziano@University of Parma",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, AC; Riani, M.+Robust diagnostic regression analysis+2000::no title+DURRLEMAN V+WHICH COPULA IS RIGH+2000::Modelling dependence with copulas+Embrechts, P; Lindskog, F; McNeil, A.+Rapport technique+2001::no title+LINDSKOG F+NOTE KENDALLS TAU EL+2001::Modelling dependence with copulas+Lindskog, F.+RiskLab Report+2000::Testing the Gaussian copula hypothesis for financial assets dependences+Malevergne, Y; Sornette, D+QUANTITATIVE FINANCE+AUG 2003::no title+MASHAL R+CORRELATION EXTREME+2002::no title+Nelsen, RB.+An introduction to copulas+1999::Finding an unknown number of multivariate outliers+Riani, M.; Atkinson, A.; Cerioli, A.+J.

Outlier detection and robust covariance estimation using mathematical programming,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0070-7,DEC 2010,19,5,"The outlier detection problem and the robust covariance estimation problem are often interchangeable. Without outliers, the classical method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can be used to estimate parameters of a known distribution from observational data. When outliers are present, they dominate the log likelihood function causing the MLE estimators to be pulled toward them. Many robust statistical methods have been developed to detect outliers and to produce estimators that are robust against deviation from model assumptions. However, the existing methods suffer either from computational complexity when problem size increases or from giving up desirable properties, such as affine equivariance. An alternative approach is to design a special mathematical programming model to find the optimal weights for all the observations, such that at the optimal solution, outliers are given smaller weights and can be detected. This method produces a covariance estimator that has the following properties: First, it is affine equivariant. Second, it is computationally efficient even for large problem sizes. Third, it easy to incorporate prior beliefs into the estimator by using semi-definite programming. The accuracy of this method is tested for different contamination models, including recently proposed ones. The method is not only faster than the Fast-MCD method for high dimensional data but also has reasonable accuracy for the tested cases.","Covariance matrix estimation,Robust statistics,Outlier detection,Optimization,Semi-definite programming,Newton-Raphson method",REGRESSION,"Nguyen, Tri-Dzung@UIUC, Newmark Civil Engn Lab 3103, Urbana, IL 61801 USA::Welsch, Roy E.@MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Ctr Computat Res Econ & Management Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Nguyen, Tri-Dzung@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Illinois System::Welsch, Roy E.@Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Nguyen, Tri-Dung@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4158-9099","PROPAGATION OF OUTLIERS IN MULTIVARIATE DATA+Alqallaf, Fatemah; Van Aelst, Stefan; Yohai, Victor J.; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2009::no title+Bertsekas, D.

A review of robust clustering methods,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0064-5,SEP 2010,77,48,"Deviations from theoretical assumptions together with the presence of certain amount of outlying observations are common in many practical statistical applications. This is also the case when applying Cluster Analysis methods, where those troubles could lead to unsatisfactory clustering results. Robust Clustering methods are aimed at avoiding these unsatisfactory results. Moreover, there exist certain connections between robust procedures and Cluster Analysis that make Robust Clustering an appealing unifying framework. A review of different robust clustering approaches in the literature is presented. Special attention is paid to methods based on trimming which try to discard most outlying data when carrying out the clustering process.","Clustering,Robustness,Model-based clustering,Trimming","TRIMMED K-MEANS,COVARIANCE DETERMINANT ESTIMATOR,SPATIAL POINT-PROCESSES,MULTIVARIATE DATA,ORTHOGONAL REGRESSION,OUTLIERS,ALGORITHM,DISTRIBUTIONS,MIXTURES,FEATURES","Angel Garcia-Escudero, Luis@Univ Valladolid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Valladolid 47002, Spain::Gordaliza, Alfonso@Univ Valladolid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Valladolid 47002, Spain::Matran, Carlos@Univ Valladolid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Valladolid 47002, Spain::Mayo-Iscar, Agustin@Univ Valladolid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Valladolid 47002, Spain","Angel Garcia-Escudero, Luis@Universidad de Valladolid::Gordaliza, Alfonso@Universidad de Valladolid::Matran, Carlos@Universidad de Valladolid::Mayo-Iscar, Agustin@Universidad de Valladolid","Matran, Carlos@J-6916-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8267-3465::Garcia-Escudero, Luis@K-4279-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7617-3034::Gordaliza, Alfonso@B-6231-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0343-2154::Mayo-Iscar, Agustin@L-7215-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0951-6508","Exploratory tools for clustering multivariate data+Atkinson, A.

Robust kernel principal component analysis and classification,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0068-1,SEP 2010,40,25,"Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) extends linear PCA from a real vector space to any high dimensional kernel feature space. The sensitivity of linear PCA to outliers is well-known and various robust alternatives have been proposed in the literature. For KPCA such robust versions received considerably less attention. In this article we present kernel versions of three robust PCA algorithms: spherical PCA, projection pursuit and ROBPCA. These robust KPCA algorithms are analyzed in a classification context applying discriminant analysis on the KPCA scores. The performances of the different robust KPCA algorithms are studied in a simulation study comparing misclassification percentages, both on clean and contaminated data. An outlier map is constructed to visualize outliers in such classification problems. A real life example from protein classification illustrates the usefulness of robust KPCA and its corresponding outlier map.","Principal component analysis,Kernel methods,Classification,Robustness","PROJECTION-PURSUIT APPROACH,KPCA PLUS LDA,FISHER DISCRIMINANT,OUTLYINGNESS,REGRESSION,DISPERSION,ESTIMATOR,ALGORITHM,LOCATION,PCA","Debruyne, Michiel@Unknow::Verdonck, Tim@Unknow","Debruyne, Michiel@Unknow::Verdonck, Tim@Unknow",not exist,"Kernel component analysis using an epsilon-insensitive robust loss function+Alzate, Carlos; Suykens, Johan A.

Optimal robust estimates using the Hellinger distance,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0061-8,SEP 2010,12,4,"Optimal robust M-estimates of a multidimensional parameter are described using Hampel's infinitesimal approach. The optimal estimates are derived by minimizing a measure of efficiency under the model, subject to a bounded measure of infinitesimal robustness. To this purpose we define measures of efficiency and infinitesimal sensitivity based on the Hellinger distance. We show that these two measures coincide with similar ones defined by Yohai using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and therefore the corresponding optimal estimates coincide too.

Inference for robust canonical variate analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0063-6,SEP 2010,29,1,"We consider the problem of optimally separating two multivariate populations. Robust linear discriminant rules can be obtained by replacing the empirical means and covariance in the classical discriminant rules by S or MM-estimates of location and scatter. We propose to use a fast and robust bootstrap method to obtain inference for such a robust discriminant analysis. This is useful since classical bootstrap methods may be unstable as well as extremely time-consuming when robust estimates such as S or MM-estimates are involved. In particular, fast and robust bootstrap can be used to investigate which variables contribute significantly to the canonical variate, and thus the discrimination of the classes. Through bootstrap, we can also examine the stability of the canonical variate. We illustrate the method on some real data examples.","Bootstrap,Canonical variate,Linear discriminant analysis,Robustness","LINEAR DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,MULTIVARIATE LOCATION,S-ESTIMATORS,BOOTSTRAP,REGRESSION,MATRICES,COVARIANCE,MODEL","Van Aelst, Stefan@Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium::Willems, Gert@Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Van Aelst, Stefan@Ghent University::Willems, Gert@Ghent University","Van Aelst, Stefan@B-5201-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9931-5330","no title+Andrews, DF; Herzberg, AM.+Data+1985::no title+ATKINSON AC+SPR S STAT+2004::Robust discrimination under a hierarchy on the scatter matrices+Bianco, Ana; Boente, Graciela; Pires, Ana M.; et al.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 2008::SOME ASYMPTOTIC THEORY FOR THE BOOTSTRAP+BICKEL, PJ; FREEDMAN, DA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::Robust linear discriminant analysis using S-estimators+Croux, C; Dehon, C+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 2001::Classification efficiencies for robust linear discriminant analysis+Croux, Christophe; Filzmoser, Peter; Joossens, Kristel+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2008::ASYMPTOTIC-BEHAVIOR OF S-ESTIMATES OF MULTIVARIATE LOCATION PARAMETERS AND DISPERSION MATRICES+DAVIES, PL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1987::1977 RIETZ LECTURE - BOOTSTRAP METHODS - ANOTHER LOOK AT THE JACKKNIFE+EFRON, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::A stepwise discriminant analysis program using density estimation+Habbema, J.D.F.; Hermans, J.; van den Broek, K.+Proceedings on computational statistics+1974::High-breakdown linear discriminant analysis+Hawkins, DM; McLachlan, GJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::High breakdown estimation for multiple populations with applications to discriminant analysis+He, XM; Fung, WK+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+FEB 2000::Fast and robust discriminant analysis+Hubert, M; Van Driessen, K+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 1 2004::High-breakdown robust multivariate methods+Hubert, Mia; Rousseeuw, Peter J.; Van Aelst, Stefan+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2008::no title+Johnson, R.

A review on consistency and robustness properties of support vector machines for heavy-tailed distributions,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0067-2,SEP 2010,21,0,"Support vector machines (SVMs) belong to the class of modern statistical machine learning techniques and can be described as M-estimators with a Hilbert norm regularization term for functions. SVMs are consistent and robust for classification and regression purposes if based on a Lipschitz continuous loss and a bounded continuous kernel with a dense reproducing kernel Hilbert space. For regression, one of the conditions used is that the output variable Y has a finite first absolute moment. This assumption, however, excludes heavy-tailed distributions. Recently, the applicability of SVMs was enlarged to these distributions by considering shifted loss functions. In this review paper, we briefly describe the approach of SVMs based on shifted loss functions and list some properties of such SVMs. Then, we prove that SVMs based on a bounded continuous kernel and on a convex and Lipschitz continuous, but not necessarily differentiable, shifted loss function have a bounded Bouligand influence function for all distributions, even for heavy-tailed distributions including extreme value distributions and Cauchy distributions. SVMs are thus robust in this sense. Our result covers the important loss functions epsilon-insensitive for regression and pinball for quantile regression, which were not covered by earlier results on the influence function. We demonstrate the usefulness of SVMs even for heavy-tailed distributions by applying SVMs to a simulated data set with Cauchy errors and to a data set of large fire insurance claims of Copenhagen Re.","Regularized empirical risk minimization,Support vector machines,Consistency,Robustness,Bouligand influence function,Heavy tails","CONVEX RISK MINIMIZATION,REGRESSION","Van Messem, Arnout@Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Math, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium::Christmann, Andreas@Univ Bayreuth, Dept Math, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Van Messem, Arnout@Vrije Universiteit Brussel::Christmann, Andreas@University of Bayreuth","Van Messem, Arnout@B-4814-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8545-7437","On robustness properties of convex risk minimization methods for pattern recognition+Christmann, A; Steinwart, I+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+AUG 2004::Consistency of kernel-based quantile regression+Christmann, Andreas; Steinwart, Ingo+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY+MAR-APR 2008::Consistency and robustness of kernel-based regression in convex risk minimization+Christmann, Andreas; Steinwart, Ingo+BERNOULLI+AUG 2007::Bouligand derivatives and robustness of support vector machines for regression+Christmann, Andreas; Van Messem, Arnout+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+MAY 2008::On consistency and robustness properties of Support Vector Machines for heavy-tailed distributions+Christmann, Andreas; Van Messem, Arnout; Steinwart, Ingo+STATISTICS AND ITS INTERFACE+2009::no title+Cristianini, N.; Shawe- Taylor, J.+An introduction to support vector machines: and other kernel- based learning methods+2000::no title+Hampel, FR.+Contributions to the theory of robust estimation+1968::INFLUENCE CURVE AND ITS ROLE IN ROBUST ESTIMATION+HAMPEL, FR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::PARAMETER AND QUANTILE ESTIMATION FOR THE GENERALIZED PARETO DISTRIBUTION+HOSKING, JRM; WALLIS, JR+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1987::The behavior of maximum likelihood estimates under non-standard conditions+Huber, PJ.+Proc.

Regularized fuzzy clusterwise ridge regression,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-009-0056-5,APR 2010,42,3,"Fuzzy clusterwise regression has been a useful method for investigating cluster-level heterogeneity of observations based on linear regression. This method integrates fuzzy clustering and ordinary least-squares regression, thereby enabling to estimate regression coefficients for each cluster and fuzzy cluster memberships of observations simultaneously. In practice, however, fuzzy clusterwise regression may suffer from multicollinearity as it builds on ordinary least-squares regression. To deal with this problem in fuzzy clusterwise regression, a new method, called regularized fuzzy clusterwise ridge regression, is proposed that combines ridge regression with regularized fuzzy clustering in a unified framework. In the proposed method, ridge regression is adopted to estimate clusterwise regression coefficients while handling potential multicollinearity among predictor variables. In addition, regularized fuzzy clustering based on maximizing entropy is utilized to systematically determine an optimal degree of fuzziness in memberships. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate parameter recovery of the proposed method as compared to the extant non-regularized counterpart. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated by an application concerning the relationship among the characteristics of used cars.","Clusterwise regression,Regularized fuzzy clustering,Ridge regression","LINEAR-REGRESSION,NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS,SWITCHING REGRESSIONS,MIXTURES","Suk, Hye Won@McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada::Hwang, Heungsun@McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Suk, Hye Won@McGill University::Hwang, Heungsun@McGill University",not exist,"Predicting Business Ethical Tolerance in International Markets: A Concomitant Clusterwise Regression Analysis+AURIFEILLE, J.

We define a method of ""projecting"" partitions using a supervised classification method: once one partition is taken as a reference; the individuals of the second data set are allocated to the clusters of the reference partition; it gives two partitions of the same units of the second data set: the original and the projected one and we evaluate their difference by usual measures of association. The empirical distributions of the association measures are derived by simulation.","Rand index,Redundancy index,Discriminant analysis,Latent classes,Partitions",INDEX,"Youness, Genane@CNAM, Dept Stat, ISAE, Beirut, Lebanon@CNAM, CEDRIC, Beirut, Lebanon::Saporta, Gilbert@CNAM, Chaire Stat Appl, F-75003 Paris, France@CNAM, CEDRIC, F-75003 Paris, France","Youness, Genane@Unknow::Saporta, Gilbert@Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM)@heSam Universite",not exist,"no title+Bartholomew, DJ; Knott, M.+Latent variable models and factor analysis+1999::no title+CHAVENT M+P SFC 2001 8 RENC SO+2001::no title+Goodman, L; Kruskal, W.+Measures of Association for Cross-Classifications+1979::no title+Hand, D.J.+Discrimination and Classification+1981::COMPARING PARTITIONS+HUBERT, L; ARABIE, P+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1985::A new measure of rank correlation+Kendall, MG+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1938::A generalized rand-index method for consensus clustering of separate partitions of the same data base+Krieger, AM; Green, PE+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1999::no title+LAZRAQ A+REV STAT APPL+2002::no title+LEBART L+FUTURIBLES+1987::no title+MARCOTORCHINO JF+REV STAT APPL+1991::no title+McLachlan, G.+Discriminant Analysis and Statistical Pattern Recoginition+2004::no title+McLachlan, G; Peel, D.+Finite mixture models+2000::ESTIMATING INDIVIDUAL RATER RELIABILITIES+OVERALL, JE; MAGEE, KN+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 1992::An exact distribution-free test comparing two multivariate distributions based on adjacency+Rosenbaum, PR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+SEP 2005::no title+Saporta, G.+Probabilites, analyse des donnees et statistique+2006::Comparing two partitions: Some proposals and experiments+Saporta, G.; Youness, G.+P COMP STAT+2002::A GENERAL CANONICAL CORRELATION INDEX+STEWART, D; LOVE, W+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1968::Latent class cluster analysis.

Tag SNP selection based on clustering according to dominant sets found using replicator dynamics,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0059-2,APR 2010,32,15,"Tag SNP selection is an important problem in genetic association studies. A class of algorithms to perform this task, among them a popular tool called Tagger, can be described as searching for a minimal vertex cover of a graph. In this article this approach is contrasted with a recently introduced clustering algorithm based on the graph theoretical concept of dominant sets. To compare the performance of both procedures comprehensive simulation studies have been performed using SNP data from the ten ENCODE regions included in the HapMap project. Quantitative traits have been simulated from additive models with a single causative SNP. Simulation results suggest that clustering performs always at least as good as Tagger, while in more than a third of the considered instances substantial improvement can be observed. Additionally an extension of the clustering algorithm is described which can be used for larger genomic data sets.","Clustering,Dominant set,Replicator dynamics,Tag SNP selection","SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS,LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM,PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS,MAXIMUM CLIQUE,HAPLOTYPE MAP,GENOTYPE DATA,ASSOCIATION,ALGORITHM,MARKERS,POWER","Frommlet, Florian@Univ Vienna, Dept Stat, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","Frommlet, Florian@University of Vienna","Frommlet, Florian@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4104-1768","A haplotype map of the human genome+Altshuler, D;

Comparison of three hypothesis testing approaches for the selection of the appropriate number of clusters of variables,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-009-0047-6,DEC 2009,33,0,"Within the scope of cluster analysis of variables, the selection of the appropriate number of clusters is of paramount interest. The strategy of determination of the appropriate number of clusters adopted herein is based on a hypothesis testing approach. It consists in testing whether the variation of a partition quality criterion between two consecutive partitions is far removed from the expected variation under the null-hypothesis stipulating a lack of structure. Three hypothesis testing strategies are detailed and compared in the scope of clustering of variables: Gap, Weighted Gap and a statistic associated with CLV methodology. Finally, an illustration is presented based on data from a preference study.","Clustering of variables,Number of clusters,Hypothesis testing approach,Gap statistic,CLV",,"Cariou, Veronique@ENITIAA INRA, Sensometr & Chemometr Lab, Rue Geraudiere,BP 82225, F-44322 Nantes 03, France::Verdun, Stephane@ENITIAA INRA, Sensometr & Chemometr Lab, Rue Geraudiere,BP 82225, F-44322 Nantes 03, France::Diaz, Emmanuelle@DTI DRIA DSTF IFH, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Integrat Facteurs Humains, F-78943 Velizy Villacoublay, France::Qannari, El Mostafa@ENITIAA INRA, Sensometr & Chemometr Lab, Rue Geraudiere,BP 82225, F-44322 Nantes 03, France::Vigneau, Evelyne@ENITIAA INRA, Sensometr & Chemometr Lab, Rue Geraudiere,BP 82225, F-44322 Nantes 03, France","Cariou, Veronique@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Ecole Nationale Veterinaire de Nantes (ONIRIS)::Verdun, Stephane@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Ecole Nationale Veterinaire de Nantes (ONIRIS)::Diaz, Emmanuelle@Peugeot::Qannari, El Mostafa@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Ecole Nationale Veterinaire de Nantes (ONIRIS)::Vigneau, Evelyne@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Ecole Nationale Veterinaire de Nantes (ONIRIS)",not exist,"Determining the number of groups from measures of cluster stability.+Bel Mufti, G; Bertrand, P; El Moubarki, L.+11 INT S APPL STOCH+2005::Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2000::ON SOME SIGNIFICANCE TESTS IN CLUSTER-ANALYSIS+BOCK, HH+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1985::Dendrite method for cluster analysis+Calinski, RB; Harabasz, JA.+Comm Stat.+1974::Individual differences and multidimensional scaling+Carroll, J.

Temporally adaptive estimation of logistic classifiers on data streams,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-009-0051-x,DEC 2009,42,3,"Modern technology has allowed real-time data collection in a variety of domains, ranging from environmental monitoring to healthcare. Consequently, there is a growing need for algorithms capable of performing inferential tasks in an online manner, continuously revising their estimates to reflect the current status of the underlying process. In particular, we are interested in constructing online and temporally adaptive classifiers capable of handling the possibly drifting decision boundaries arising in streaming environments. We first make a quadratic approximation to the log-likelihood that yields a recursive algorithm for fitting logistic regression online. We then suggest a novel way of equipping this framework with self-tuning forgetting factors. The resulting scheme is capable of tracking changes in the underlying probability distribution, adapting the decision boundary appropriately and hence maintaining high classification accuracy in dynamic or unstable environments. We demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in both real and simulated streaming environments.","Logistic regression,Adaptive forgetting,Data streams,Classification","ALGORITHMS,CLASSIFICATION,TRACKING,SYSTEM,DRIFT","Anagnostopoulos, Christoforos@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Inst Math Sci, London SW7 2PG, England::Tasoulis, Dimitris K.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England::Adams, Niall M.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England::Hand, David J.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Inst Math Sci, London SW7 2PG, England@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England","Anagnostopoulos, Christoforos@Imperial College London::Tasoulis, Dimitris K.@Imperial College London::Adams, Niall M.@Imperial College London::Hand, David J.@Imperial College London",not exist,"Improving the practice of classifier performance assessment+Adams, NM; Hand, DJ+NEURAL COMPUTATION+FEB 2000::no title+AGGARWAL CC+KDD 04+2004::no title+ALAIZRODRIGEZ R+SCIENCE+2008::no title+Baena-Garcia, M.; del Campo-Avila, J.; Fidalgo, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Bifet, A.; Gavalda, R.; Morales-Bueno, R</span>.+Early drift detection method+2006::Algorithms for sparse linear classifiers in the massive data setting+Balakrishnan, Suhrid; Madigan, David+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+FEB 2008::no title+Benveniste, A; Metivier, M; Priouret, P.+Adaptive Algorithms and Stochastic Approximations+1990::Learning classification rules for telecom customer call data under concept drift+Black, M; Hickey, R+SOFT COMPUTING+DEC 2003::A comparison of batch and incremental supervised learning algorithms+Carbonara, L; Borrowman, A+PRINCIPLES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY+1998::Semi-supervised classification by low density separation+Chapelle, O.; Zien, A.+P 10 INT WORKSH ART+2005::Classifier design for population and sensor drift+Copsey, K; Webb, A+STRUCTURAL, SYNTACTIC, AND STATISTICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION, PROCEEDINGS+2004::no title+COPSEY KD+AUTOMATIC TARGET REC+2005::Identifying and tracking changing interests+Crabtree, B.; Soltysiak, J.+Int.

New robust dynamic plots for regression mixture detection,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-009-0050-y,DEC 2009,15,5,"The forward search is a powerful general method for detecting multiple masked outliers and for determining their effect on inferences about models fitted to data. From the monitoring of a series of statistics based on subsets of data of increasing size we obtain multiple views of any hidden structure. One of the problems of the forward search has always been the lack of an automatic link among the great variety of plots which are monitored. Usually it happens that a lot of interesting features emerge unexpectedly during the progression of the forward search only when a specific combination of forward plots is inspected at the same time. Thus, the analyst should be able to interact with the plots and redefine or refine the links among them. In the absence of dynamic linking and interaction tools, the analyst risks to miss relevant hidden information. In this paper we fill this gap and provide the user with a set of new robust graphical tools whose power will be demonstrated on several regression problems. Through the analysis of real and simulated data we give a series of examples where dynamic interaction with different ""robust plots"" is used to highlight the presence of groups of outliers and regression mixtures and appraise the effect that these hidden groups exert on the fitted model.","Forward search,Robustness,Exploratory data analysis,Data visualization,Statistical graphics,Brushing and linking","SEARCH,OUTLIERS","Perrotta, Domenico@Commiss European Communities, Global Secur & Crisis Management Unit, Inst Protect & Secur Citizens, Joint Res Ctr, I-21027 Ispra, Italy::Riani, Marco@Univ Parma, Dipartimento Econ, Div Stat & Comp, I-43100 Parma, Italy::Torti, Francesca@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Stat, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Perrotta, Domenico@European Commission Joint Research Centre@EC JRC ISPRA Site::Riani, Marco@University of Parma::Torti, Francesca@University of Milano-Bicocca","Perrotta, Domenico@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0987-3823::Riani, Marco@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7886-2207","Forward search added-variable t-tests and the effect of masked outliers on model selection+Atkinson, AC; Riani, M+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2002::no title+Atkinson, AC; Riani, M.+Robust diagnostic regression analysis+2000::no title+ATKINSON AC+SPR S STAT+2004::no title+BUJA A+ELECT J STAT+2009::no title+CHEN C+SPRINGER HDB COMPUTA+2008::Milestones in the history of data visualization: A case study in statistical historiography+Friendly, M+CLASSIFICATION - THE UBIQUITOUS CHALLENGE+2005::no title+Martinez, A.

The value of the last digit: statistical fraud detection with digit analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-009-0048-5,DEC 2009,8,4,"Digit distributions are a popular tool for the detection of tax payers' noncompliance and other fraud. In the early stage of digital analysis, Nigrini and Mittermaier (A J Pract Theory 16(2):52-67, 1997) made use of Benford's Law (Benford in Am Philos Soc 78:551-572, 1938) as a natural reference distribution. A justification of that hypothesis is only known for multiplicative sequences (Schatte in J Inf Process Cyber EIK 24:443-455, 1988). In applications, most of the number generating processes are of an additive nature and no single choice of 'an universal first-digit law' seems to be plausible (Scott and Fasli in Benford's law: an empirical investigation and a novel explanation. CSM Technical Report 349, Department of Computer Science, University of Essex, http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/technical-reports/2001/CSM-349.pdf, 2001). In that situation, some practioneers (e.g. financial authorities) take recourse to a last digit analysis based on the hypothesis of a Laplace distribution. We prove that last digits are approximately uniform for distributions with an absolutely continuous distribution function. From a practical perspective, that result, of course, is only moderately interesting. For that reason, we derive a result for 'certain' sums of lattice-variables as well. That justification is provided in terms of stationary distributions.","Fraud detection,Last digits,Digit analysis,Benford's law",,"Dlugosz, Stephan@ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany::Mueller-Funk, Ulrich@ERCIS, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Dlugosz, Stephan@Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW)::Mueller-Funk, Ulrich@Unknow",not exist,"The law of anomalous numbers+Benford, F.+Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society+1938::Statistical fraud detection: A review+Bolton, RJ; Hand, DJ+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2002::Toeplitz and Circulant Matrices: A Review+Gray, Robert M.+FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION THEORY+2006::no title+Kemeny, JG; Snell, JL.+Finite Markov Chains+1976::The use of Benford's Law as an aid in analytical procedures+Nigrini, MJ; Mittermaier, LJ+AUDITING-A JOURNAL OF PRACTICE &amp; THEORY+FAL 1997::CONVERGENCE-RATES FOR MARKOV-CHAINS+ROSENTHAL, JS+SIAM REVIEW+SEP 1995::On mantissa distributions in computing and Benford's law+Schatte, P.+Journal of Information Processing and Cybernetics+1988::no title+SCOTT PD+349 CSM U ESS DEP CO+2001"

In this paper, we propose a simple intuitive necessary and sufficient condition for some subset of objects to be a critical set of a finite Moore family. This condition is based on a new characterization of quasi-closed sets. Moreover, we provide a necessary condition for a subset containing more than k objects (k >= 2) to be a critical set of a k-weakly hierarchical Moore family. Finally, as a consequence of this result, we identify critical sets of some k-weakly hierarchical Moore families and thereby generalize a result earlier obtained by Domenach and Leclerc in the particular case of weak hierarchies.","Closure operator,Closure system,Implication,Quasi-closed set,Weak hierarchy","IMPLICATIONAL SYSTEMS,CLOSURE SYSTEMS,CHOICE","Diatta, Jean@Univ Reunion, Parc Technol Univ Bat 2,2 Rue J Wetzell, St Clothilde 97490, Reunion, France","Diatta, Jean@University of La Reunion",not exist,"Dependency structures of data base relationships+Armstrong, William Ward.+INFORM PROCESSING+1974::WEAK HIERARCHIES ASSOCIATED WITH SIMILARITY MEASURES - AN ADDITIVE CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE+BANDELT, HJ; DRESS, AWM+BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY+1989::AN ORDER THEORETIC FRAMEWORK FOR OVERLAPPING CLUSTERING+BANDELT, HJ; DRESS, AWM+DISCRETE MATHEMATICS+DEC 31 1994::no title+BANDELT HJ+MATH SEM U HAMB GERM+1992::no title+Barbut, M; Monjardet, B.+Ordre et Classification.

Tests of ignoring and eliminating in nonsymmetric correspondence analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-009-0054-7,DEC 2009,39,7,"Nonsymmetric correspondence analysis (NSCA) aims to examine predictive relationships between rows and columns of a contingency table. The predictor categories of such tables are often accompanied by some auxiliary information. Constrained NSCA (CNSCA) incorporates such information as linear constraints on the predictor categories. However, imposing constraints also means that part of the predictive relationship is left unaccounted for by the constraints. A method of NSCA is proposed for analyzing the residual part along with the part accounted for by the constraints. The CATANOVA test may be invoked to test the significance of each part. The two tests parallel the distinction between tests of ignoring and eliminating, and help gain some insight into what is known as Simpson's paradox in the analysis of contingency tables. Two examples are given to illustrate the distinction.","Contingency table analysis,The Goodman-Kruskal tau index,CATANOVA,Simpson's paradox","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,CATEGORICAL-DATA,VARIABLES,VARIANCE,MULTIPLE","Takane, Yoshio@McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada::Jung, Sunho@McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Takane, Yoshio@McGill University::Jung, Sunho@McGill University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Partitioning the variation among spatial, temporal and environmental components in a multivariate data set+Anderson, MJ; Gribble, NA+AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY+APR 1998::CATANOVA FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINGENCY-TABLES - NOMINAL-SCALE RESPONSE+ANDERSON, RJ; LANDIS, JR+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1980::SIMPSONS PARADOX AND SURE-THING PRINCIPLE+BLYTH, CR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1972::Linear constraints in correspondence analysis+Bockenholt, U.; Takane, Y.+Correspondence Analysis in the Social Sciences: Recent Developments and Applications+1994::CANONICAL-ANALYSIS OF CONTINGENCY-TABLES WITH LINEAR CONSTRAINTS+BOCKENHOLT, U; BOCKENHOLT, I+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1990::PARTIALLING OUT THE SPATIAL COMPONENT OF ECOLOGICAL VARIATION+BORCARD, D; LEGENDRE, P; DRAPEAU, P+ECOLOGY+JUN 1992::Data information in contingency tables: a fallacy of hierarchical loglinear models+Cheng, PE; Liou, JW; Liou, M<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Aston, JAD</span>.+J Data Sci+2006::Catanova for two-way contingency tables with ordinal variables using orthogonal polynomials+D'Ambra, L; Beh, EJ; Amenta, P+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2005::Non symmetrical analysis of three way contingency tables+D'Ambra, L; Lauro, NC.+Multiway data analysis+1989::no title+Efron, B.+An Introduction to the Bootstrap+1993::THE ANALYSIS OF MULTIVARIATE CONTINGENCY-TABLES BY RESTRICTED CANONICAL AND RESTRICTED ASSOCIATION MODELS+GILULA, Z; HABERMAN, SJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1988::MEASURES OF ASSOCIATION FOR CROSS CLASSIFICATIONS+GOODMAN, LA; KRUSKAL, WH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1954::GOODMAN AND KRUSKAL TAU-B - MULTIPLE AND PARTIAL ANALOGS+GRAY, LN; WILLIAMS, JS+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+1981::no title+Greenacre, MJ.+Theory and applications of correspondence analysis+1984::RIDGE REGRESSION - BIASED ESTIMATION FOR NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS+HOERL, AE; KENNARD, RW+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::Generalized constrained multiple correspondence analysis+Hwang, HS; Takane, Y+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2002::A NOTE ON A MANOVA MODEL APPLIED TO PROBLEMS IN GROWTH CURVE+KHATRI, CG+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+1966::no title+LAURO NC+DATA ANAL INFORM+1984::no title+Legendre, P; Legendre, L.+Numerical Ecology+1998::ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE FOR CATEGORICAL DATA+LIGHT, RJ; MARGOLIN, BH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE FOR CATEGORICAL DATA .2.

Comparison of alignment free string distances for complete genome phylogeny,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-009-0041-z,SEP 2009,19,15,"In this paper, we compare the accuracy of four string distances on complete genomes to reconstruct phylogenies using simulated and real biological data. These distances are based on common words shared by raw genomic sequences and do not require preliminary processing steps such as gene identification or sequence alignment. Moreover, they are computable in linear time. The first distance is based on Maximum Significant Matches (MSM). The second is computed from the frequencies of all the words of length k (KW). The third distance is based on the Average length of maximum Common Substrings at any position (ACS). The last one is based on the Ziv-Lempel compression algorithm (ZL). We describe a simulation process of evolution to generate a set of sequences having evolved according to a random tree topology T. This process allows both base substitution and fragment insertion/deletion, including horizontal transfers. The distances between the generated sequences are computed using the four formulas and the corresponding trees T' are reconstructed using Neighbor-Joining. T and T' are compared according to topological criteria. These comparisons show that the MSM distance outperforms the others whatever the parameters used to generate sequences. Finally, we test the MSM and KW distances on real biological data (i.e. prokaryotic complete genomes) and we compare the NJ trees to a Maximum Likelihood 16S + 23S RNA tree. We show that the MSM distance provides accurate results to study intra-phylum relationships, much better than those given by KW.","Phylogeny,String distances,Complete bacterial genomes","CHAOS GAME REPRESENTATION,TREES,SEQUENCES,ALGORITHM","Guyon, Frederic@Univ Paris 07, INSERM, MTI, Paris, France::Brochier-Armanet, Celine@Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, IBSM LCB, Marseille, France::Guenoche, Alain@Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, IML, Marseille, France","Guyon, Frederic@University of Paris Diderot@Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)@Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite-USPC (ComUE)::Brochier-Armanet, Celine@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Aix-Marseille Universite::Guenoche, Alain@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Aix-Marseille Universite",not exist,"BASIC LOCAL ALIGNMENT SEARCH TOOL+ALTSCHUL, SF; GISH, W; MILLER, W; et al.+JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY+OCT 5 1990::Maximum agreement subtree in a set of evolutionary trees: Metrics and efficient algorithms+Amir, A; Keselman, D+SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING+DEC 1997::Genomic signature: Characterization and classification of species assessed by chaos game representation of sequences+Deschavanne, PJ; Giron, A; Vilain, J; et al.+MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION+OCT 1999::MUSCLE: a multiple sequence alignment method with reduced time and space complexity+Edgar, RC+BMC BIOINFORMATICS+AUG 19 2004::COMPARISON OF UNDIRECTED PHYLOGENETIC TREES BASED ON SUBTREES OF 4 EVOLUTIONARY UNITS+ESTABROOK, GF; MCMORRIS, FR; MEACHAM, CA+SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY+1985::A simple, fast, and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood+Guindon, S; Gascuel, O+SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY+OCT 2003::no title+GUYON F+COMMUN STAT IN PRESS+2009::Prokaryotic phylogeny based on complete genomes without sequence aligment+Hao, B.L.; Qi, J.; Wang, B.+Modern Phys.

"On Robinsonian dissimilarities, the consecutive ones property and latent variable models",ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-009-0042-y,SEP 2009,49,5,"A dissimilarity measure on a set of objects is Robinsonian if its matrix can be symmetrically permuted so that its elements do not decrease when moving away from the main diagonal along any row or column. The Robinson property of a dissimilarity reflects an order of the objects. If a dissimilarity is not observed directly, it must be obtained from the data. Given that an ordinal structure is assumed to underlie the data, the dissimilarity function of choice may or may not recover the order correctly. For four dissimilarity measures for binary data it is investigated what ordinal data structure of 0s and 1s is correctly recovered. We derive sufficient conditions for the dissimilarity functions to be Robinsonian. The sufficient conditions differ with the dissimilarity measures. The paper concludes with some limitations of the study.","Dissimilarity measures,Binary data,Ordinal comparison,Pyramids,Ordered clustering systems,Weakly pseudo-hierarchies","RESEMBLANCE MEASURES,INTERVAL GRAPHS,TRAIT MODEL,2X2 TABLES,COEFFICIENTS,MATRICES,CHANCE","Warrens, Matthijs J.@Leiden Univ, Unit Methodol & Stat, Inst Psychol, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands","Warrens, Matthijs J.@Leiden University",not exist,"On similarity indices and correction for chance agreement+Albatineh, Ahmed N.; Niewiadomska-Bugaj, Magdalena; Mihalko, Daniel+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2006::A HYPERBOLIC COSINE LATENT TRAIT MODEL FOR UNFOLDING DICHOTOMOUS SINGLE-STIMULUS RESPONSES+ANDRICH, D; LUO, GZ+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1993::THE APPLICATION OF AN UNFOLDING MODEL OF THE PIRT TYPE TO THE MEASUREMENT OF ATTITUDE+ANDRICH, D+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 1988::no title+Barthelemy, J.P.; Brucker, F.; Osswald, C.+Combinatorial optimization and hier-archical classifications+2004::COMPARING RESEMBLANCE MEASURES+BATAGELJ, V; BREN, M+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1995::A CLASSIFICATION OF PRESENCE ABSENCE BASED DISSIMILARITY COEFFICIENTS+BAULIEU, FB+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1989::A visual representation of the compatibility between an order and a dissimilarity index: the pyramids+Bertrand, P.; Diday, E.+Computational Statistics Quarterly+1985::TESTING FOR CONSECUTIVE ONES PROPERTY, INTERVAL GRAPHS, AND GRAPH PLANARITY USING PQ-TREE ALGORITHMS+BOOTH, KS; LUEKER, GS+JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES+1976::no title+BRAUN-BLANQUET, J.+Plant sociology, the study of plant community+1932::Recognition of Robinsonian dissimilarities+Chepoi, V+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1997::no title+Coombs, C.H.+A Theory of Data+1964::no title+CRITCHLEY F+CLASSIFICATION DISSI+1994::MEASURES OF THE AMOUNT OF ECOLOGIC ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SPECIES+DICE, LR+ECOLOGY+1945::Orders and overlapping clusters in pyramids+Diday, E.+Multidimensional data analysis+1986::Une representation des classes empietantes : les pyramides+Diday, E.+Research report INRIA 291+1984::no title+FICHET B+ACT JOURN STAT GRAND+1984::LATENT CLASS MODELS FOR NONMONOTONE DICHOTOMOUS ITEMS+FORMANN, AK+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 1988::INCIDENCE MATRICES AND INTERVAL GRAPHS+FULKERSON, DR; GROSS, OA+PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS+1965::FILE ORGANIZATION - CONSECUTIVE RETRIEVAL PROPERTY+GHOSH, SP+COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM+1972::METRIC AND EUCLIDEAN PROPERTIES OF DISSIMILARITY COEFFICIENTS+GOWER, JC; LEGENDRE, P+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1986::no title+GOWER JC+MULTIDIMENSIONAL DAT+1986::Physical mapping by STS hybridization: algorithmic strategies and the challenge of software evaluation.+Greenberg, D S; Istrail, S+Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology+1995::no title+HOIJTINK H+PARELLA MEASUREMENT+1991::A LATENT TRAIT MODEL FOR DICHOTOMOUS CHOICE DATA+HOIJTINK, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1990::A simple test for the consecutive ones property+Hsu, WL+JOURNAL OF ALGORITHMS-COGNITION INFORMATICS AND LOGIC+APR 2002::SOME APPLICATIONS OF GRAPH THEORY AND RELATED NONMETRIC TECHNIQUES TO PROBLEMS OF APPROXIMATE SERIATION - CASE OF SYMMETRIC PROXIMITY MEASURES+HUBERT, L+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1974::Graph-theoretic representations for proximity matrices through strongly-anti-Robinson or circular strongly-anti-Robinson matrices+Hubert, L+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1998::The distribution of the flora in the alpine zone+Jaccard, P.+New Phytol+1912::no title+Karlin, S.+Total Positivity+1968::Seriation from abundance matrices+Kendall, D.

We are undertaking a meta-analytic study of these studies, attempting to distil some overall conclusions. This paper describes just one of our observations. The dataset analysed in this paper contains 5,203 error rates taken from 45 articles and describing 146 datasets. One curious general relationship which was persistent in our data, despite the fact that we were looking at results mixed between distributions rather than conditional on distributions, was that error rate decreased with increasing dataset size.

Optimum simultaneous discretization with data grid models in supervised classification: a Bayesian model selection approach,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-009-0038-7,JUN 2009,46,6,"In the domain of data preparation for supervised classification, filter methods for variable ranking are time efficient. However, their intrinsic univariate limitation prevents them from detecting redundancies or constructive interactions between variables. This paper introduces a new method to automatically, rapidly and reliably extract the classificatory information of a pair of input variables. It is based on a simultaneous partitioning of the domains of each input variable, into intervals in the numerical case and into groups of categories in the categorical case. The resulting input data grid allows to quantify the joint information between the two input variables and the output variable. The best joint partitioning is searched by maximizing a Bayesian model selection criterion. Intensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of the approach, especially the significant improvement of accuracy for classification tasks.","Data preparation,Discretization,Feature selection,Model selection,Supervised classification","CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES,PRINCIPLES,ALGORITHM","Boulle, Marc@Orange Labs, F-22300 Lannion, France","Boulle, Marc@Orange SA",not exist,"no title+ABRAMOWITZ, M; STEGUN, J.

Interpolation of spatial and spatio-temporal Gaussian fields using Gaussian Markov random fields,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-008-0019-2,JUN 2009,18,0,"This paper considers interpolation on a lattice of covariance-based Gaussian Random Field models (Geostatistics models) using Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs) (conditional autoregression models). Two methods for estimating the GMRF parameters are considered. One generalises maximum likelihood for complete data, and the other ensures a better correspondence between fitted and theoretical correlations for higher lags. The methods can be used both for spatial and spatio-temporal data. Some different cross-validation methods for model choice are compared. The predictive ability of the GMRF is demonstrated by a simulation study, and an example using a real image is considered.","Gaussian Markov random fields,Geostatistics,Interpolation,Inverse correlations,Kriging,Spatio-temporal processes","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,LATTICE PROCESSES,MODELS","Fontanella, L.@Univ G DAnnunzio, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Theory, I-65127 Pescara, Italy::Ippoliti, L.@Univ G DAnnunzio, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Theory, I-65127 Pescara, Italy::Martin, R.

Multi-objective optimization for clustering 3-way gene expression data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-008-0032-5,DEC 2008,21,3,"In this paper, we use the Fuzzy C-means method for clustering 3-way gene expression data via optimization of multiple objectives. A reformulation of the total clustering criterion is used to obtain an expression which has fewer variables compared to the classical FCM criterion. This transformation allows the use of a direct global optimizer in constrast to the alternating search commonly used. Gene expression data from microarray technology is generally of high dimension. The problem of empty space is known for this kind of data. We propose in this paper a transformation allowing more contrast in distances between all pairs of data samples. This, hence, increases the likelihood of detecting group structure, if any, in high dimensional datasets.","Multi-objective optimization,Clustering,Fuzzy C-means,Microarray,Gene expression data",,"Dembele, Doulaye@CNRS IMSERM ULP, IGBMC, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France","Dembele, Doulaye@Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)","Dembele, Doulaye@O-6513-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3879-6940","Polyglutamine expansion causes neurodegeneration by altering the neuronal differentiation program+Abou-Sleymane, G; Chalmel, F; Helmlinger, D; et al.+HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS+MAR 1 2006::Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays+Alon, U; Barkai, N; Notterman, DA; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+JUN 8 1999::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::When is ""nearest neighbor"" meaningful?+Beyer, K; Goldstein, J; Ramakrishnan, R; et al.+DATABASE THEORY - ICDT'99+1999::no title+Bezdek, J.

A constrained-optimization based half-quadratic algorithm for robustly fitting sets of linearly parametrized curves,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-008-0031-6,DEC 2008,25,5,"We consider the problem of multiple fitting of linearly parametrized curves, that arises in many computer vision problems such as road scene analysis. Data extracted from images usually contain non-Gaussian noise and outliers, which makes classical estimation methods ineffective. In this paper, we first introduce a family of robust probability density functions which appears to be well-suited to many real-world problems. Also, such noise models are suitable for defining continuation heuristics to escape shallow local minima and their robustness is devised in terms of breakdown point. Second, the usual Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) robust estimator is extended to the problem of robustly estimating sets of linearly parametrized curves. The resulting, non-convex optimization problem is tackled within a Lagrangian approach, leading to the so-called Simultaneous Robust Multiple Fitting (SRMF) algorithm, whose global convergence to a local minimum is proved using results from constrained optimization theory.","Non-convex problem,Constrained optimisation,Primal and dual problem,Robust estimators,Image analysis",,"Tarel, Jean-Philippe@LCPC, ESE, F-75015 Paris, France::Ieng, Sio-Song@LCPC, ESE, F-75015 Paris, France::Charbonnier, Pierre@Lab Ponts & Chaussees, ERA LCPC 27, F-67035 Strasbourg, France","Tarel, Jean-Philippe@IFSTTAR@Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussees (LCPC)::Ieng, Sio-Song@IFSTTAR@Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussees (LCPC)::Charbonnier, Pierre@Unknow","Charbonnier, Pierre@H-4037-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9374-5647::Tarel, Jean-Philippe@A-5598-2013","On global and local convergence of half-quadratic algorithms+Allain, M; Idier, J; Goussard, Y+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING+MAY 2006::no title+Aubert, G.; Kornprobst, P.+Mathematical Problems in Image Processing: Partial Differential Equations and the Calculus of Variations+2006::no title+BIGORGNE E+P AS C COMP VIS ACCV+2007::On the unification of line processes, outlier rejection, and robust statistics with applications in early vision+Black, MJ; Rangarajan, A+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION+JUL 1996::no title+Blake, A; Zisserman, A.+Visual reconstruction+1987::Deterministic edge-preserving regularization in computed imaging+Charbonnier, P; BlancFeraud, L; Aubert, G; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING+FEB 1997::Globally convergent edge-preserving regularized reconstruction: An application to limited-angle tomography+Delaney, AH; Bresler, Y+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING+FEB 1998::RANDOM SAMPLE CONSENSUS - A PARADIGM FOR MODEL-FITTING WITH APPLICATIONS TO IMAGE-ANALYSIS AND AUTOMATED CARTOGRAPHY+FISCHLER, MA; BOLLES, RC+COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM+1981::Constrained restoration and the recovery of discontinuities+Geman, S.; Reynolds, G.+IEEE Trans.

About the non-convex optimization problem induced by non-positive semidefinite kernel learning,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-008-0033-4,DEC 2008,27,7,"During the last years, kernel based methods proved to be very successful for many real-world learning problems. One of the main reasons for this success is the efficiency on large data sets which is a result of the fact that kernel methods like support vector machines (SVM) are based on a convex optimization problem. Solving a new learning problem can now often be reduced to the choice of an appropriate kernel function and kernel parameters. However, it can be shown that even the most powerful kernel methods can still fail on quite simple data sets in cases where the inherent feature space induced by the used kernel function is not sufficient. In these cases, an explicit feature space transformation or detection of latent variables proved to be more successful. Since such an explicit feature construction is often not feasible for large data sets, the ultimate goal for efficient kernel learning would be the adaptive creation of new and appropriate kernel functions. It can, however, not be guaranteed that such a kernel function still leads to a convex optimization problem for Support Vector Machines. Therefore, we have to enhance the optimization core of the learning method itself before we can use it with arbitrary, i.e., non-positive semidefinite, kernel functions. This article motivates the usage of appropriate feature spaces and discusses the possible consequences leading to non-convex optimization problems. We will show that these new non-convex optimization SVM are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on eight real-world benchmark data sets in terms of the generalization performance. They always outperform traditional approaches in terms of the original optimization problem. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite or indefinite kernel functions.","Support vector machine,Kernel methods,Non-convex optimization",,"Mierswa, Ingo@Tech Univ Dortmund, Artificial Intelligence Unit, Dept Comp Sci, Dortmund, Germany::Morik, Katharina@Tech Univ Dortmund, Artificial Intelligence Unit, Dept Comp Sci, Dortmund, Germany","Mierswa, Ingo@Dortmund University of Technology::Morik, Katharina@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"The Schur Algorithm, Reproducing Kernel Spaces and System Theory+Alpay, D.+SMF AMS TEXTS MONOGR+2001::A tutorial on Support Vector Machines for pattern recognition+Burges, CJC+DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY+JUN 1998::Fuzzy sigmoid kernel for support vector classifiers+Camps-Valls, G; Martin-Guerrero, JD; Rojo-Alvarez, JL; et al.+NEUROCOMPUTING+DEC 2004::no title+Chang, C.-C.; Lin, C.-J.+LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines+2001::Feature selection for support vector machines using genetic algorithms+Frphlich, H; Chapelle, O; Scholkopf, B.+Int J Artif Intell Tools+2004::Feature space interpretation of SVMs with indefinite kernels+Haasdonk, B+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+APR 2005::no title+Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R; Friedman, J.+The Elements of Statistical Learning+2001::no title+Joachims, T.+Making Large-Scale SVM Learning Practical.

A DC programming approach for feature selection in support vector machines learning,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-008-0030-7,DEC 2008,29,42,"Feature selection consists of choosing a subset of available features that capture the relevant properties of the data. In supervised pattern classification, a good choice of features is fundamental for building compact and accurate classifiers. In this paper, we develop an efficient feature selection method using the zero-norm l(0) in the context of support vector machines (SVMs). Discontinuity at the origin for l(0) makes the solution of the corresponding optimization problem difficult to solve. To overcome this drawback, we use a robust DC(difference of convex functions) programming approach which is a general framework for non-convex continuous optimisation. We consider an appropriate continuous approximation to l(0) such that the resulting problem can be formulated as a DC program. Our DC algorithm (DCA) has a finite convergence and requires solving one linear program at each iteration. Computational experiments on standard datasets including challenging feature-selection problems of the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge and gene selection for cancer classification show that the proposed method is promising: while it suppresses up to more than 99% of the features, it can provide a good classification. Moreover, the comparative results illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach over standard methods such as classical SVMs and feature selection concave.","Feature selection,SVM,Nonconvex optimisation,DC programming,DCA",,"Le Thi, Hoai An@Univ Paul Verlaine, Lab Theoret & Appl Comp Sci LITA EA 3097, UFR MIM, F-57045 Metz, France::Le, Hoai Minh@Univ Paul Verlaine, Lab Theoret & Appl Comp Sci LITA EA 3097, UFR MIM, F-57045 Metz, France::Nguyen, Van Vinh@Univ Paul Verlaine, Lab Theoret & Appl Comp Sci LITA EA 3097, UFR MIM, F-57045 Metz, France::Dinh, Tao Pham@Inst Natl Sci Appl, Lab Modelling Optimizat & Operat Res, F-76131 Mont St Aignan, France","Le Thi, Hoai An@Universite de Lorraine::Le, Hoai Minh@Universite de Lorraine::Nguyen, Van Vinh@Universite de Lorraine::Dinh, Tao Pham@Unknow","Le, Hoai Minh@P-2579-2014","On the approximability of minimizing nonzero variables or unsatisfied relations in linear systems+Amaldi, E; Kann, V+THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE+DEC 6 1998::A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers+Boser, B; Guyon, I; Vapnik, V.+P 5 ANN WORKSH COMP+1992::Feature selection via concave minimization and support vector machines+Bradley, PS; Mangasarian, OL.+P INT C MACH LEARN I+1998::SUPPORT-VECTOR NETWORKS+CORTES, C; VAPNIK, V+MACHINE LEARNING+SEP 1995::no title+Cristianini, N.; Shawe- Taylor, J.+An introduction to support vector machines: and other kernel- based learning methods+2000::Molecular classification of cancer: Class discovery and class prediction by gene expression monitoring+Golub, TR; Slonim, DK; Tamayo, P; et al.+SCIENCE+OCT 15 1999::no title+Guyon, I; Gunn, S; Nikravesh, M<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Zadeh, LA</span>.+Feature extraction: foundations and applications+2006::Gene selection for cancer classification using support vector machines+Guyon, I; Weston, J; Barnhill, S; et al.+MACHINE LEARNING+2002::The entire regularization path for the support vector machine+Hastie, T; Rosset, S; Tibshirani, R; et al.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+OCT 2004::Leveraging the margin more carefully+Krause, N.; Singer, Y.+P 21 INT C MACH LEAR+2004::The DC (difference of convex functions) programming and DCA revisited with DC models of real world nonconvex optimization problems+Le Thi, H.A.; Pham Dinh, T.+Ann.

Generalized marginal homogeneity model and its relation to marginal equimoments for square contingency tables with ordered categories,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-008-0028-1,DEC 2008,17,3,"For square contingency tables with ordered categories, Tomizawa (Calcutta Stat Assoc Bull 43:123-125, 1993a; Sankhya Ser B 60:293-300, 1998) gave theorems that the marginal homogeneity (MH) model is equivalent to certain two or three models holding simultaneously. This paper proposes a generalized MH model, which describes a structure of the odds that an observation will fall in row category i or below and column category i + 1 or above, instead of in column category i or below and row category i + 1 or above. In addition, this paper gives the theorems that the MH model is equivalent to the generalized MH model and some models holding simultaneously whose each indicates: (1) the equality of m-order moment of row and column variables, (2) the equality of skewness of them and (3) the equality of kurtosis of them. When the MH model fits the data poorly, these may be useful for seeing the reason for the poor fit; for instance, the poor fit of the MH model is caused by the poor fit of the equality of row and column means rather than the generalized MH model.

Fitting semiparametric clustering models to dissimilarity data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-008-0025-4,OCT 2008,44,2,"The cluster analysis problem of partitioning a set of objects from dissimilarity data is here handled with the statistical model-based approach of fitting the ""closest"" classification matrix to the observed dissimilarities. A classification matrix represents a clustering structure expressed in terms of dissimilarities. In cluster analysis there is a lack of methodologies widely used to directly partition a set of objects from dissimilarity data. In real applications, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied on dissimilarities and subsequently a partition is chosen by visual inspection of the dendrogram. Alternatively, a ""tandem analysis"" is used by first applying a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm and then by using a partitioning algorithm such as k-means applied on the dimensions specified by the MDS. However, neither the hierarchical clustering algorithms nor the tandem analysis is specifically defined to solve the statistical problem of fitting the closest partition to the observed dissimilarities. This lack of appropriate methodologies motivates this paper, in particular, the introduction and the study of three new object partitioning models for dissimilarity data, their estimation via least-squares and the introduction of three new fast algorithms.","Cluster analysis,Partitions,Semiparametric clustering models,LS-estimation",,"Vichi, Maurizio@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat Probabil & Appl Stat, Rome, Italy","Vichi, Maurizio@Sapienza University Rome",not exist,"UCI machine learning repository+Asuncion, A; Newman, D.+UCI MACHINE LEARNING+2007::A CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE FOR SUMMARIZING MULTIVARIATE DATA+BALL, GH; HALL, DJ+BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE+1967::RECOGNITION OF TREE METRICS+BANDELT, HJ+SIAM JOURNAL ON DISCRETE MATHEMATICS+FEB 1990::no title+Bock, H.H.+Automatische Klassifikation+1974::Probabilistic aspects in classification+Bock, H.H.+Data Science, Classification and Related Methods+1998::no title+CARROLL JD+SIMILARITY CHOICE+1980::no title+CARROLL JD+US JAP SEM THEOR MET+1975::SCREE TEST FOR NUMBER OF FACTORS+CATTELL, RB+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1966::CONSTRUCTION OF ULTRAMETRICS NEAREST A DISSIMILARITY IN SENSE OF LEAST-SQUARES+CHANDON, JL; LEMAIRE, J; POUGET, J+RAIRO-RECHERCHE OPERATIONNELLE-OPERATIONS RESEARCH+1980::REVIEW OF CLASSIFICATION+CORMACK, RM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-GENERAL+1971::The Partial Order by Inclusion of the Principal Classes of Dissimilarities on a Finite Set, and Some of Their Basic Properties+CRITCHLEY, F.; FICHET, B.+Classification and Dissimilarity Analysis+1994::FAST PARALLEL RECOGNITION OF ULTRAMETRICS AND TREE METRICS+DAHLHAUS, E+SIAM JOURNAL ON DISCRETE MATHEMATICS+NOV 1993::A LEAST-SQUARES ALGORITHM FOR FITTING AN ULTRAMETRIC TREE TO A DISSIMILARITY MATRIX+DESOETE, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+1984::no title+Dubes, R.C; Jain, A.K.+Algorithms for clustering data+1988::ADMISSIBLE CLUSTERING PROCEDURES+FISHER, L; VANNESS, JW+BIOMETRIKA+1971::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::no title+Gordon, Aaron D.+Classification: Methods for the Exploratory Analysis of Multivariate Data+1999::PARSIMONIOUS TREES+GORDON, AD+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1987::SOME DISTANCE PROPERTIES OF LATENT ROOT AND VECTOR METHODS USED IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+GOWER, JC+BIOMETRIKA+1966::A CUTTING PLANE ALGORITHM FOR A CLUSTERING PROBLEM+GROTSCHEL, M; WAKABAYASHI, Y+MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING+AUG 1989::no title+HANSEN P+NEW APPROACHES CLASS+1994::no title+Hartigan, J A.+Clustering Algorithms+1975::REPRESENTATION OF SIMILARITY MATRICES BY TREES+HARTIGAN, JA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1967::Cluster-wise assessment of cluster stability+Hennig, Christian+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 15 2007::COMPARING PARTITIONS+HUBERT, L; ARABIE, P+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1985::Hierarchical clustering and the construction of (optimal) ultrametrics using L-p-norms+Hubert, L; Arabie, P; Meulman, J+L(1)-STATISTICAL PROCEDURES AND RELATED TOPICS+1997::no title+Kaufman, L; Rousseeuw, P.

Second, taxicab correspondence analysis of a Burt table is equivalent to centroid correspondence analysis of the indicator matrix. Third, along the first principal axis, the projected response patterns in MTCA will be clustered and the number of cluster points is less than or equal to 1+ the number of variables. Fourth, visual maps produced by MTCA seem to be clearer and more readable in the presence of rarely occurring categories of the variables than the graphical displays produced by MCA.

The first proposed formula corresponds to edges weighted by a probability of existence. The second one is adapted to edges weighted by intensity or strength. We show on simulated graphs that the class identification process is improved by computing weighted compared to unweighted edges. Finally, an application to a drosophila protein network illustrates the fact that using these new formulas improves the 'biological accuracy' of partitioning.","Graph distance,Graph partitioning,Heuristic optimisation,Biological networks",,"Angelelli, Jean-Baptiste@Univ Mediterranee, CNRS, IML, F-13288 Marseille 9, France::Baudot, Anais@Univ Mediterranee, CNRS, IBDML, F-13288 Marseille 9, France::Brun, Christine@Univ Mediterranee, CNRS, IBDML, F-13288 Marseille 9, France::Guenoche, Alain@Univ Mediterranee, CNRS, IML, F-13288 Marseille 9, France","Angelelli, Jean-Baptiste@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Aix-Marseille Universite::Baudot, Anais@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Aix-Marseille Universite::Brun, Christine@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Aix-Marseille Universite::Guenoche, Alain@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Aix-Marseille Universite","Baudot, Anais@G-9963-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0885-7933::Brun, Christine@B-4922-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5563-6765","Down-regulation of FAK and IAPs by laminin during cisplatin-induced apoptosis in testicular germ cell tumors+Andjilani, M; Droz, JP; Benahmed, M; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY+FEB 2006::An automated method for finding molecular complexes in large protein interaction networks+Bader, GD; Hogue, CW+BMC BIOINFORMATICS+JAN 13 2003::PRODISTIN Web Site: a tool for the functional classification of proteins from interaction networks+Baudot, A; Martin, D; Mouren, P; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+JAN 15 2006::A scale of functional divergence for yeast duplicated genes revealed from analysis of the protein-protein interaction network+Baudot, A; Jacq, B; Brun, C+GENOME BIOLOGY+2004::Experiments on graph clustering algorithms+Brandes, U; Gaertler, M; Wagner, D+ALGORITHMS - ESA 2003, PROCEEDINGS+2003::Clustering proteins from interaction networks for the prediction of cellular functions+Brun, C; Herrmann, C; Guenoche, A+BMC BIOINFORMATICS+JUL 13 2004::Functional classification of proteins for the prediction of cellular function from a protein-protein interaction network.+Brun, Christine; Chevenet, Francois; Martin, David; et al.+Genome biology+2003::Maximum transfer distance between partitions+Charon, I; Denoeud, L; Guenoche, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+2006::Increasing confidence of protein-protein interactomes.+Chen, Jin; Chua, Hon Nian; Hsu, Wynne; et al.+Genome informatics.

SVM-Maj: a majorization approach to linear support vector machines with different hinge errors,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-008-0020-9,APR 2008,28,5,"Support vector machines (SVM) are becoming increasingly popular for the prediction of a binary dependent variable. SVMs perform very well with respect to competing techniques. Often, the solution of an SVM is obtained by switching to the dual. In this paper, we stick to the primal support vector machine problem, study its effective aspects, and propose varieties of convex loss functions such as the standard for SVM with the absolute hinge error as well as the quadratic hinge and the Huber hinge errors. We present an iterative majorization algorithm that minimizes each of the adaptations. In addition, we show that many of the features of an SVM are also obtained by an optimal scaling approach to regression. We illustrate this with an example from the literature and do a comparison of different methods on several empirical data sets.","Support vector machines,Iterative majorization,Absolute hinge error,Quadratic hinge error,Huber hinge error,Optimal scaling",,"Groenen, P.

Two methods for estimating the GMRF parameters are considered. One generalises maximum likelihood for complete data, and the other ensures a better correspondence between fitted and theoretical correlations for higher lags. The methods can be used both for spatial and spatio-temporal data. Some different cross-validation methods for model choice are compared. The predictive ability of the GMRF is demonstrated by a simulation study, and an example using a real image is considered.","Gaussian Markov random fields,Geostatistics,Interpolation,Inverse correlations,Kriging,Spatio-temporal processes",,"Fontanella, L.@Univ G DAnnunzio, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Theory, I-65127 Pescara, Italy::Ippoliti, L.@Univ G DAnnunzio, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Theory, I-65127 Pescara, Italy::Martin, R.

Generalized constrained co-inertia analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-008-0017-4,APR 2008,59,2,"In this paper a method for generalized constrained co-inertia analysis is proposed. This approach is based on a suitable decomposition of each set of variables which incorporates external information on both rows and columns of data matrices. These external information are incorporated in the analysis in order to improve the interpretability of the phenomenon under investigation. Once both matrices are decomposed according to the external information, we propose to apply the co-inertia analysis to any pair of obtainable submatrices in order to study relationships between them. A variety of existing and new extensions of COA are then realized. According to the nature of the data, this approach subsumes also several generalized constrained methods proposed in literature. An example is given to illustrate the proposed method.","External information,Constrained principal component analysis,Co-inertia analysis,Generalized singular value decomposition",,"Amenta, Pietro@Univ Sannio, Dept Anal Econ & Social Syst, I-82100 Benevento, Italy","Amenta, Pietro@University of Sannio",not exist,"no title+AMENTA P+DATA INFORM ANAL KNO+2005::no title+AMENTA P+P 37 IT STAT SOC C S+1994::no title+AMENTA P+QUADERNI STAT DIPART+1996::Double restricted Co-Inertia Analysis+Amenta, Pietro+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+DEC 2007::Rotated canonical analysis onto a reference subspace+Balbi, S; Esposito, V+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2000::no title+BEH JE+SOME INTERPRET UNPUB+2007::CANONICAL-ANALYSIS OF CONTINGENCY-TABLES WITH LINEAR CONSTRAINTS+BOCKENHOLT, U; BOCKENHOLT, I+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1990::no title+Brady, N; Weil, R.+The nature and properties of soils+2002::AN INTERCOMPARISON OF METHODS FOR FINDING COUPLED PATTERNS IN CLIMATE DATA+BRETHERTON, CS; SMITH, C; WALLACE, JM+JOURNAL OF CLIMATE+JUN 1992::Frameworks for latent variable multivariate regression+Burnham, AJ; Viveros, R; MacGregor, JF+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1996::L'analyse des correspondances internes d'un tableau partitionne: son usage en hydrobiologie+CAZES, P.; CHESSEL, D.; DOLEDEC, S.+Rev.

Discrimination with jointly equicorrelated multi-level multivariate data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-007-0013-0,DEC 2007,17,12,"In this article we study a linear as well as a quadratic discriminant function for multi-level multivariate repeated measurement data under the assumption of multivariate normality. We assume that the m-variate observations have jointly equicorrelated covariance structure in addition to a Kronecker product structure on the mean vector. The new discriminant functions are very effective in discriminating individuals when the number of observations is very small. The proposed classification rules are demonstrated on a real data set. The error rates of the proposed classification rules are found to be much less than the error rates of the traditional classification rules, when in fact the traditional classification rules fail most of the time owing to the small sample sizes.","Classification rule,Jointly equicorrelated covariance structure,Multivariate repeated measures data,Maximum likelihood estimates",,"Roy, Anuradha@Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Management Sci & Stat, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA::Leiva, Ricardo@Univ Nacl Cuyo, Dept Matemat, FCE, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina","Roy, Anuradha@University of Texas System@University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)::Leiva, Ricardo@University Nacional Cuyo Mendoza","Roy, Anuradha@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0294-6185","no title+Anderson, T.W.+An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+2003::AN INVERSE MATRIX ADJUSTMENT ARISING IN DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS+BARTLETT, MS+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1951::CLASSIFICATION OF MULTIPLY OBSERVED DATA+CHOI, SC+BIOMETRISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT+1972::On a multivariate statistical classification model+Gupta, A.K.+Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Proceedings of the Research Seminar+1980::ON A CLASSIFICATION RULE FOR MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS+GUPTA, AK+COMPUTERS &amp; MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS-PART A+FEB 1986::no title+Johnson, R.A.; Wichern, D.W.+Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis+2007::Antedependence models in the analysis of multi-group high-dimensional data+Krzanowski, WJ+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JAN 1999::no title+KRZANOWSKI WJ+MULTIVARIATE ANAL FU+1993::Generalizacion de la distancia de Mahalanobis para el analisis discriminante lineal en poblaciones con matrices de covarianza desiguales+Leiva, R.; Herrera, M.+Revista de la Sociedad Argentina de Estadistica+1999::Linear discrimination with equicorrelated training vectors+Leiva, Ricardo+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+FEB 2007::no title+McLachlan, G.J.+Discriminant analysis and statistical pattern recognition+1992::Bayesian object identification: Variants+Ritter, G; Gallegos, MT+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAY 2002::no title+ROY A+CALCUTTA STAT ASS B+2005::Classification of multivariate repeated measures data with temporal autocorrelation+Roy, A.; Khattree, R.+J.

A global algorithm to estimate the expectations of the components of an observed univariate mixture,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-007-0014-z,DEC 2007,16,4,"This paper deals with the unsupervised classification of univariate observations. Given a set of observations originating from a K-component mixture, we focus on the estimation of the component expectations. We propose an algorithm based on the minimization of the ""K-product"" (KP) criterion we introduced in a previous work. We show that the global minimum of this criterion can be reached by first solving a linear system then calculating the roots of some polynomial of order K. The KP global minimum provides a first raw estimate of the component expectations, then a nearest-neighbour classification enables to refine this estimation. Our method's relevance is finally illustrated through simulations of various mixtures. When the mixture components do not strongly overlap, the KP algorithm provides better estimates than the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.","Univariate mixture,Component expectations estimation,Unsupervised classification",,"Paul, Nicolas@Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, F-75003 Paris, France::Terre, Michel@Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, F-75003 Paris, France::Fety, Luc@Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, F-75003 Paris, France","Paul, Nicolas@Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM)@heSam Universite::Terre, Michel@Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM)@heSam Universite::Fety, Luc@Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM)@heSam Universite",not exist,"Survey of clustering data mining techniques+Berkhin, P.+Recent Adv.

Lambda pruning: an approximation of the string subsequence kernel for practical SVM classification and redundancy clustering,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-007-0012-1,DEC 2007,15,6,"The support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful learning algorithm, e. g., for classification and clustering tasks, that works even for complex data structures such as strings, trees, lists and general graphs. It is based on the usage of a kernel function for measuring scalar products between data units. For analyzing string data Lodhi et al. (J Mach Learn Res 2:419-444, 2002) have introduced a String Subsequence kernel (SSK). In this paper we propose an approximation to SSK based on dropping higher orders terms (i.e., subsequences which are spread out more than a certain threshold) that reduces the computational burden of SSK. As we are also concerned with practical application of complex kernels with high computational complexity and memory consumption, we provide an empirical model to predict runtime and memory of the approximation as well as the original SSK, based on easily measurable properties of input data. We provide extensive results on the properties of the proposed approximation, SSK-LP, with respect to prediction accuracy, runtime and memory consumption. Using some real-life datasets of text mining tasks, we show that models based on SSK and SSK-LP perform similarly for a set of real-life learning tasks, and that the empirical runtime model is also useful in roughly determining total learning time for a SVM using either kernel.","Machine learning,Kernel methods,String kernels,Runtime estimation,Memory consumption estimation",,"Seewald, Alexander K.@Seewald Solut, A-1180 Vienna, Austria::Kleedorfer, Florian@Smart Agent Techn, Res Studios Austria, A-1160 Vienna, Austria","Seewald, Alexander K.@Unknow::Kleedorfer, Florian@Unknow",not exist,"Convolution kernels for Natural Language+Collins, M; Duffy, N+ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 14, VOLS 1 AND 2+2002::Rational kernels: Theory and algorithms+Cortes, C; Haffner, P; Mohri, M+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+AUG 2004::no title+Cristianini, N.; Shawe- Taylor, J.+An introduction to support vector machines: and other kernel- based learning methods+2000::no title+Frank, E; Witten, IH.+Data mining: practical machine learning tools and techniques+2005::no title+HAUSSLER D+UCSCCRL9910 SCI ENG+1999::no title+Joachims, T.+Learning to Classify Texts using Support Vector Machines: Methods, Theory and Algorithms+2002::The spectrum kernel: a string kernel for SVM protein classification.+Leslie, Christina; Eskin, Eleazar; Noble, William Stafford+Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

A recursive partitioning tool for interval prediction,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-007-0015-y,DEC 2007,13,1,"The traditional approach to regression trees involves partitioning the space of predictor variables into subsets that optimise a function of the response variable(s), and then predicting future response values by a single-valued summary statistic in each subset. Our belief is that a prediction interval is of greater practical use than a predictive value, and that the criterion for the partitioning should be based on such intervals rather than on single values. We define four potential criteria in the case of a single response variable, discuss computational aspects of producing the partition, evaluate the criteria on both real and simulated data, and draw some tentative conclusions about their relative efficacies. The methodology is extended to the case of multiple response variables, and its viability is demonstrated by application to some further real data. The possibility of fitting distributions to within-subsets data is discussed, and some potential extensions are briefly outlined.","Binary splitting,CART,Clustering,Criterion optimisation,Multivariate response variable,Prediction intervals,Regression trees",,"Krzanowski, Wojtek J.@Univ Exeter, Sch Engn Comp Sci & Math, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England::Hand, David J.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Inst Math Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England","Krzanowski, Wojtek J.@University of Exeter::Hand, David J.@Imperial College London",not exist,"no title+Breiman, L; Friedman, J; Stone, CJ<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Olshen, RA</span>.+Classification and regression trees+1984::Random forests+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+OCT 2001::Modified classification and regression tree splitting criteria for data with interactions+Bremner, AP; Taplin, RH+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2002::Extension of multivariate regression trees to interval data.

Evaluation of supervised learning is typically based on the error rates of the classification rules. In this paper we first discuss typical problems and possible influential features derived from signal analysis, mental mechanisms or concepts, and compositional structure.

Fuzzy clustering based on nonconvex optimisation approaches using difference of convex (DC) functions algorithms,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-007-0011-2,AUG 2007,30,1,"We present a fast and robust nonconvex optimization approach for Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering model. Our approach is based on DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DCA (DC Algorithms) that have been successfully applied in various fields of applied sciences, including Machine Learning. The FCM model is reformulated in the form of three equivalent DC programs for which different DCA schemes are investigated. For accelerating the DCA, an alternative FCM-DCA procedure is developed. Experimental results on several real world problems that include microarray data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and their superiority over the standard FCM algorithm, with respect to both running-time and accuracy of solutions.","Fuzzy clustering,Nonconvex optimization,DC programming,DCA",,"Thi, Hoai An Le@Univ Paul Verlaine Metz, Lab Theoret & Appl Comp Sci LITA EA 3097, UFR MIM, F-57045 Metz, France::Le, Hoai Minh@Univ Paul Verlaine Metz, Lab Theoret & Appl Comp Sci LITA EA 3097, UFR MIM, F-57045 Metz, France::Dinh, Tao Pham@Inst Natl Sci Appl, Lab Modelling Optimizat & Operat Res, F-76131 Mont St Aignan, France","Thi, Hoai An Le@Universite de Lorraine::Le, Hoai Minh@Universite de Lorraine::Dinh, Tao Pham@Unknow","Le, Hoai Minh@P-2579-2014","no title+ALON N+PROBABILISTIC METHOD+1991::Learning mixtures of arbitrary Gaussians+Arora, S.; Kannan, R.+P 33 ANN ACM S THEOR+2001::no title+Bezdek, J.

Variable selection in discriminant analysis based on the location model for mixed variables,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-007-0009-9,AUG 2007,32,5,"Non-parametric smoothing of the location model is a potential basis for discriminating between groups of objects using mixtures of continuous and categorical variables simultaneously. However, it may lead to unreliable estimates of parameters when too many variables are involved. This paper proposes a method for performing variable selection on the basis of distance between groups as measured by smoothed Kullback-Leibler divergence. Searching strategies using forward, backward and step-wise selections are outlined, and corresponding stopping rules derived from asymptotic distributional results are proposed. Results from a Monte Carlo study demonstrate the feasibility of the method. Examples on real data show that the method is generally competitive with, and sometimes is better than, other existing classification methods.","Brier score,Cross-validation,Discriminant analysis,Error rate,Kullback-Leibler divergence,Location model,Non-parametric smoothing procedures,Variable selection","MAHALANOBIS DISTANCE,ERROR RATE,BINARY","Mahat, Nor Idayu@Univ Utara Malaysia, Fac Quantitat Sci, Sintok 06010, Kedah, Malaysia::Krzanowski, Wojtek Janusz@Univ Exeter, Sch Engn Comp Sci & Math, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England::Hernandez, Adolfo@Univ Complutense, Escuela Univ Estudios Empresariales, Madrid 28003, Spain","Mahat, Nor Idayu@Universiti Utara Malaysia::Krzanowski, Wojtek Janusz@University of Exeter::Hernandez, Adolfo@Complutense University of Madrid",not exist,"New fast algorithms for error rate-based stepwise variable selection in discriminant analysis+Aeberhard, S; De Vel, OY; Coomans, DH+SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING+OCT 18 2000::MULTIVARIATE BINARY DISCRIMINATION BY KERNEL METHOD+AITCHISON, J; AITKEN, CGG+BIOMETRIKA+1976::Non-parametric smoothing of the location model in mixed variable discrimination+Asparoukhov, O; Krzanowski, WJ+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+OCT 2000::GENERALIZATION OF THE MAHALANOBIS DISTANCE IN THE MIXED CASE+BARHEN, A; DAUDIN, JJ+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAY 1995::Some theory for Fisher's linear discriminant function, 'naive Bayes', and some alternatives when there are many more variables than observations+Bickel, PJ; Levina, E+BERNOULLI+DEC 2004::CLASSIFICATION BASED ON DICHOTOMOUS AND CONTINUOUS VARIABLES+CHANG, PC; AFIFI, AA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::COMPARISON OF STOPPING RULES IN FORWARD STEPWISE DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS+COSTANZA, MC; AFIFI, AA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::Statistical modeling: The two cultures - Comments and rejoinders+Cox, DR; Efron, B; Hoadley, B; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2001::SELECTION OF VARIABLES IN MIXED-VARIABLE DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS+DAUDIN, JJ+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1986::Selection in discriminant analysis with continuous and discrete variables+Daudin, JJ; Bar-Hen, A+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 28 1999::A note on comparing classifiers+Duin, RPW+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+MAY 1 1996::no title+EVERITT BS+J APPL STAT+1990::ANALYSIS OF INCOMPLETE MULTI-WAY CONTINGENCY TABLES+FIENBERG, SE+BIOMETRICS+1972::On selecting Variables and assessing their performance inlinear discriminant analysis+Ganeshanandam, S.; Krzanowski, W.

Fast calibrations of the forward search for testing multiple outliers in regression,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-007-0007-y,AUG 2007,16,11,"The paper considers the problem of testing for multiple outliers in a regression model and provides fast approximations to the null distribution of the minimum deletion residual used as a test statistic. Since direct simulation of each combination of number of observations and number of parameters is too time consuming, methods using simple normal samples are described for approximating the pointwise distribution of the test statistic.

Convex ordering criteria for Levy processes,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-007-0008-x,AUG 2007,27,3,"Modelling financial and insurance time series with Levy processes or with exponential Levy processes is a relevant actual practice and an active area of research. It allows qualitatively and quantitatively good adaptation to the empirical statistical properties of asset returns. Due to model incompleteness it is a problem of considerable interest to determine the dependence of option prices in these models on the choice of pricing measures and to establish nontrivial price bounds. In this paper we review and extend ordering results of stochastic and convex type for this class of models. We also extend the ordering results to processes with independent increments (PII) and present several examples and applications as to alpha-stable processes, NIG-processes, GH-distributions, and others. Criteria are given for the Levy measures which imply corresponding comparison results for European type options in (exponential) Levy models.","Convex ordering,Levy measure,Levy process",,"Bergenthum, Jan@Univ Freiburg, Dept Math Stochast, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany::Rueschendorf, Ludger@Univ Freiburg, Dept Math Stochast, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Bergenthum, Jan@University of Freiburg::Rueschendorf, Ludger@University of Freiburg",not exist,"EXPONENTIALLY DECREASING DISTRIBUTIONS FOR LOGARITHM OF PARTICLE-SIZE+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O+PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES+1977::Incompleteness of markets driven by a mixed diffusion+Bellamy, N.; Jeanblanc, M.+Finance Stoch+2000::no title+BERGENTHUM J+THESIS U FREIBURG+2005::Comparison of semimartingales and Levy processes+Bergenthum, Jan; Ruedschendorf, Ludger+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+JAN 2007::Comparison of option prices in semimartingale models+Bergenthum, Jan; Rueschendorf, Ludger+FINANCE AND STOCHASTICS+APR 2006::Processes of Normal Inverse Gaussian Type+Brandorff-Nielsen, O.

Adaptive dissimilarity index for measuring time series proximity,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-006-0004-6,MAR 2007,18,24,"The most widely used measures of time series proximity are the Euclidean distance and dynamic time warping. The latter can be derived from the distance introduced by Maurice Frechet in 1906 to account for the proximity between curves. The major limitation of these proximity measures is that they are based on the closeness of the values regardless of the similarity w.r.t. the growth behavior of the time series. To alleviate this drawback we propose a new dissimilarity index, based on an automatic adaptive tuning function, to include both proximity measures w.r.t. values and w.r.t. behavior. A comparative numerical analysis between the proposed index and the classical distance measures is performed on the basis of two datasets: a synthetic dataset and a dataset from a public health study.","Classification,Time Series,Frechet distance,Dynamic time warping",,"Chouakria, Ahlame Douzal@Univ Grenoble 1, TIMC IMAG, F-38706 La Tronche, France::Nagabhushan, Panduranga Naidu@Univ Mysore Manasagangothri, Dept Studies Comp Sci, Mysore 570006, Karnataka, India","Chouakria, Ahlame Douzal@Universite de Lyon (ComUE)@VetAgro Sup@Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes@Universite Clermont Auvergne & Associes@Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA)::Nagabhushan, Panduranga Naidu@University of Mysore",not exist,"Measuring the resemblance of polygonal curves+Alt, H.; Godau, M.+Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry+1992::A periodogram-based metric for time series classification+Caiado, Jorge; Crato, Nuno; Pena, Daniel+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 20 2006::no title+DOUZAL AC+ADV INTELLIGENT DATA+2003::Computing Discrete Frechet Distance+Eiter, T.; Mannila, H.+Tech.

The parameters estimation is performed using a Generalized EM (GEM) algorithm.

We analyze such models within a set-arithmetic approach. Contrary to what happens for random variables, the least squares optimal solutions for the basic affine transformation model do not produce suitable estimates for the linear regression model. First, we derive least squares estimators for the simple linear regression model and examine them from a theoretical perspective. Moreover, the multiple linear regression model is dealt with and a stepwise algorithm is developed in order to find the estimates in this case.

Correspondence analysis of textual data involving contextual information: CA-GALT on principal components,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0171-9,JUN 2015,28,2,"Correspondence analysis on an aggregated lexical table is a typical practice in textual analysis in which a contextual categorical variable is used to aggregate documents, depending on the categories to which they belong. This work generalises this approach and considers several quantitative, categorical or mixed contextual variables. The result is a new method that we have called 'correspondence analysis on a generalised aggregated lexical table'. A favoured application derives from surveys by questionnaire, including both open-ended and closed questions. The free-text answers are encoded into a respondents words frequency table called a lexical table. The closed questions, either quantitative or categorical, form the contextual variables. The primary objective is to establish a typology of the variables and a typology of the words from their mutual relationships as grasped from jointly analysing the textual and contextual tables. Validation tests are offered, particularly in the form of confidence ellipses. The comprehensive and numerous properties of the method, similar to correspondence analysis properties, are detailed. Promising results are obtained as indicated by an application to a marketing survey conducted among 1,000 respondents.","Correspondence analysis,Textual and contextual data,Textual analysis,Lexical table,Confidence ellipses,Contingency table","CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS,REGRESSION,TABLES","Becue-Bertaut, Monica@Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain::Pages, Jerome@Agrocampus Ouest, Lab Math Appl, F-35042 Rennes, France","Becue-Bertaut, Monica@Polytechnic University of Catalonia::Pages, Jerome@Agrocampus Ouest",not exist,"A factorial technique for analyzing textual data with external information+Balbi, S; Giordano, G.+ADV CLASSIFICATION D+2001::A Doubly Projected Analysis for Lexical Tables+Balbi, Simona; Misuraca, Michelangelo+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS TO RELIABILITY AND INFERENCE, DATA MINING, BIOINFORMATICS, LIFETIME DATA, AND NEURAL NETWORKS+2010::A principal axes method for comparing contingency tables: MFACT+Becue-Bertaut, M; Pages, J+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 10 2004::Multiple factor analysis and clustering of a mixture of quantitative, categorical and frequency data+Becue-Bertaut, Monica; Pages, Jerome+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 20 2008::no title+Benzecri, J.

Enhancing the selection of a model-based clustering with external categorical variables,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0177-3,JUN 2015,17,2,"In cluster analysis, it can be useful to interpret the partition built from the data in the light of external categorical variables which are not directly involved to cluster the data. An approach is proposed in the model-based clustering context to select a number of clusters which both fits the data well and takes advantage of the potential illustrative ability of the external variables. This approach makes use of the integrated joint likelihood of the data and the partitions at hand, namely the model-based partition and the partitions associated to the external variables. It is noteworthy that each mixture model is fitted by the maximum likelihood methodology to the data, excluding the external variables which are used to select a relevant mixture model only. Numerical experiments illustrate the promising behaviour of the derived criterion.","Mixture models,Model-based clustering,Number of clusters,Penalised criteria,Categorical variables,BIC,ICL,Mixed type variables clustering",LIKELIHOOD,"Baudry, Jean-Patrick@Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, EA 3124, LSTA, F-75005 Paris, France::Cardoso, Margarida@ISCTE Univ Inst Lisbon, Dept Quantitat Methods Management & Econ, Business Res Unit, Lisbon, Portugal::Celeux, Gilles@INRIA Saclay Ile de France, Orsay, France::Amorim, Maria Jose@Lisbon Univ Inst, Inst Super Engn Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal::Ferreira, Ana Sousa@Univ Lisbon, Fac Psychol, Business Res Unit, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal","Baudry, Jean-Patrick@Sorbonne Universite::Cardoso, Margarida@Instituto Universitario de Lisboa::Celeux, Gilles@Inria::Amorim, Maria Jose@Instituto Universitario de Lisboa@Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon::Ferreira, Ana Sousa@Universidade de Lisboa","Sousa Ferreira, Ana Maria@A-8294-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3582-4179::Cardoso, Maria Margarida@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6239-7283","no title+Bache, Kevin; Lichman, Moshe.+UCI machine learning repository+2013::no title+Baudry, J.-P.+Selection demodele pour la classification non supervisee.

Mixture model averaging for clustering,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0182-6,JUN 2015,62,5,"In mixture model-based clustering applications, it is common to fit several models from a family and report clustering results from only the 'best' one. In such circumstances, selection of this best model is achieved using a model selection criterion, most often the Bayesian information criterion. Rather than throw away all but the best model, we average multiple models that are in some sense close to the best one, thereby producing a weighted average of clustering results. Two (weighted) averaging approaches are considered: averaging component membership probabilities and averaging models. In both cases, Occam's window is used to determine closeness to the best model and weights are computed within a Bayesian model averaging paradigm. In some cases, we need to merge components before averaging; we introduce a method for merging mixture components based on the adjusted Rand index. The effectiveness of our model-based clustering averaging approaches is illustrated using a family of Gaussian mixture models on real and simulated data.","Clustering,Mixture models,Model averaging,Model-based clustering","EXPRESSION DATA,BAYES FACTORS,CLASSIFICATION,UNCERTAINTY,LIKELIHOOD,COMPONENTS,REGRESSION,SELECTION,TUTORIAL,CRITERIA","Wei, Yuhong@Univ Guelph, Dept Math & Stat, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada::McNicholas, Paul D.@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada","Wei, Yuhong@University of Guelph::McNicholas, Paul D.@McMaster University",not exist,"Model-based classification via mixtures of multivariate t-distributions+Andrews, Jeffrey L.; McNicholas, Paul D.; Subedi, Sanjeena+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 1 2011::Extending mixtures of multivariate t-factor analyzers+Andrews, Jeffrey L.; McNicholas, Paul D.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUL 2011::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::ESTIMATION OF ALLOCATION RATES IN A CLUSTER-ANALYSIS CONTEXT+BASFORD, KE; MCLACHLAN, GJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::Combining Mixture Components for Clustering+Baudry, Jean-Patrick; Raftery, Adrian E.; Celeux, Gilles; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2010::A LASSO-penalized BIC for mixture model selection+Bhattacharya, Sakyajit; McNicholas, Paul D.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+MAR 2014::Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2000::High-dimensional data clustering+Bouveyron, C.; Girard, S.; Schmid, C.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 15 2007::no title+Browne, R.

Spline-based nonlinear biplots,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0179-1,JUN 2015,17,2,"Biplots are helpful tools to establish the relations between samples and variables in a single plot. Most biplots use a projection interpretation of sample points onto linear lines representing variables. These lines can have marker points to make it easy to find the reconstructed value of the sample point on that variable. For classical multivariate techniques such as principal components analysis, such linear biplots are well established. Other visualization techniques for dimension reduction, such as multidimensional scaling, focus on an often nonlinear mapping in a low dimensional space with emphasis on the representation of the samples. In such cases, the linear biplot can be too restrictive to properly describe the relations between the samples and the variables. In this paper, we propose a simple nonlinear biplot that represents the marker points of a variable on a curved line that is governed by splines. Its main attraction is its simplicity of interpretation: the reconstructed value of a sample point on a variable is the value of the closest marker point on the smooth curved line representing the variable. The proposed spline-based biplot can never lead to a worse overall sample fit of the variable as it contains the linear biplot as a special case.","Biplot,Multidimensional scaling,Principal components analysis,Splines",,"Groenen, Patrick J.

Basic statistics for distributional symbolic variables: a new metric-based approach,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0176-4,JUN 2015,30,6,"In data mining it is usual to describe a group of measurements using summary statistics or through empirical distribution functions. Symbolic data analysis (SDA) aims at the treatment of such kinds of data, allowing the description and the analysis of conceptual data or of macrodata summarizing classical data. In the conceptual framework of SDA, the paper aims at presenting new basic statistics for distribution-valued variables, i.e., variables whose realizations are distributions. The proposed measures extend some classical univariate (mean, variance, standard deviation) and bivariate (covariance and correlation) basic statistics to distribution-valued variables, taking into account the nature and the variability of such data. The novel statistics are based on a distance between distributions: the Wasserstein distance. A comparison with other univariate and bivariate statistics presented in the literature points out some relevant properties of the proposed ones. An application on a clinic dataset shows the main differences in terms of interpretation of results.","Wasserstein metric,Symbolic data,Distribution-valued data,Histogram data,Basic statistics",,"Irpino, Antonio@Second Univ Naples Caserta, Dept Polit Sci J Monnet, Viale Ellitt 31, Caserta, Italy::Verde, Rosanna@Second Univ Naples Caserta, Dept Polit Sci J Monnet, Viale Ellitt 31, Caserta, Italy","Irpino, Antonio@Unknow::Verde, Rosanna@Unknow","Irpino, Antonio@G-6775-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9293-7180::VERDE, Rosanna@P-5004-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9959-4675","no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::Two probabilistic models for classification of variables in frequency tables+Bacelar Nicolau, H.+Classification and Related Methods of Data Analysis.

Principal component analysis for probabilistic symbolic data: a more generic and accurate algorithm,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0178-2,MAR 2015,34,3,"In the symbolic data framework, probabilistic symbolic data are considered as those whose components are random variables with general probability distributions. Intervals (or uniform distributions), histograms (or empirical distributions), Gaussian distribution and Chi-squared distribution are all the special cases of them. The existing approaches devoted to the subject have a common shortcoming since they can not obtain the distributions of linear combinations (i.e., principal components) of random variables especially for not identically distributed ones. This paper will overcome the shortcoming by providing an exact probability density function for each principal component by using the inversion theorem. Further, the paper defines a covariance matrix for probabilistic symbolic data and presents a new principal component analysis based on this variance-covariance structure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by a simulated numerical experiment, and two real-life cases including clustering of oils and fats data, and evaluation of indexed journals of Science Citation Index.","Principal component analysis,Symbolic data,Probabilistic symbolic data,Characteristic function",INTERVAL-VALUED DATA,"Chen, Meiling@Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China::Wang, Huiwen@Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China::Qin, Zhongfeng@Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China","Chen, Meiling@Beihang University::Wang, Huiwen@Beihang University::Qin, Zhongfeng@Beihang University",not exist,"THE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITIONAL DATA+AITCHISON, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::From the statistics of data to the statistics of knowledge: Symbolic data analysis+Billard, L; Diday, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2003::no title+Billard, L; Diday, E.+Symbolic Data Analysis: Conceptual Statistics and Data Mining+2006::no title+Bock, Hans Hermann.+Analysis of Symbolic Data: Exploratory Methods for Extracting Statistical Information from Complex Data+2000::Symbolic principal components analysis+Cazes, P; Chouakria, A; Diday, E.+Analysis of symbolic data+2000::Analyse factorielle d'un tableau de lois de probabilite+Cazes, P.+Revue de Statistique Appliquee+2002::Extensions de l'Analyse en Composantes Principales a des donnees de type intervalle+Cazes, P; Chouakria, A; Diday, E<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Schektman, Y</span>.+Revue de Statistique Appliquee+1997::Vertices principal components analysis with an improved factorial representation+Chouakria, A.; Diday, E.; Cazes, P.+ADV DATA SCI CLASSIF+1998::A least squares approach to principal component analysis for interval valued data+D'Urso, P; Giordani, P+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+FEB 28 2004::Probabilist, possibilist and belief objects for knowledge analysis+Diday, E.+Ann Oper Res+1995::no title+DIDAY E+CLASSIFICATION RELAT+1987::Mixture decomposition of distributions by copulas in the symbolic data analysis framework+Diday, E; Vrac, M+DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS+APR 1 2005::no title+Diday, E; Noirhomme-Fraiture, M.+Symbolic Data Analysis and the SODAS software+2008::Principal component analysis for interval-valued observations+Douzal-Chouakria, A.; Billard, L.; Diday, E.+Statistical Analysis and Data Mining+April 2011::no title+Ferraty, F.; Vieu, P.+Nonparametric Functional Data Analysis+2006::Principal component analysis on interval data+Gioia, Federica; Lauro, Carlo N.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2006::GENERALIZED MINKOWSKI METRICS FOR MIXED FEATURE-TYPE DATA-ANALYSIS+ICHINO, M; YAGUCHI, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS+APR 1994::The quantile method for symbolic principal component analysis+Ichino, M.+Statistical Analysis and Data Mining+April 2011::Basic statistics for probabilistic symbolic variables: a novelmetric-based approach+Irpino, A; Verde, R.+arXiv: 1110.2295+2011::no title+Lauro, CN; Verde, R; Palumbo, F.+Factorial data analysis on symbolic objects under cohesion constrains+2000::Symbolic Covariance Principal Component Analysis and Visualization for Interval-Valued Data+Le-Rademacher, Jennifer; Billard, Lynne+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2012::Adaptation of interval PCA to symbolic histogram variables+Makosso-Kallyth, Sun; Diday, Edwin+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+JUL 2012::Comparing dissimilarity measures for probabilistic symbolic objects+Malerba, D; Esposito, F; Monopoli, M+DATA MINING III+2002::Histogram PCA+Nagabhushan, P.; Kumar, R.

The Symbolic Data Analysis approach aims at studying classes of individuals considered as new units. These units are described by variables whose values express for each class the variation of the values taken by each of its individuals. Finally, the results obtained are compared to those previously provided by multiple logistic regression analysis. Symbolic Data Analysis actually provides a new perspective on this study and suggests that some demographic, economics and environmental parameters are related to the disease and its evolution during the treatment, whatever the strategy. Moreover, it is shown that the efficiency of each strategy depends on environmental parameters.","Symbolic Data Analysis,Multiple logistic regression,Trachoma",,"Guinot, Christiane@Univ Tours, Lab Informat, F-37200 Tours, France::Malvy, Denis@CHU St Andre, Dept Med Interne, F-33076 Bordeaux, France@Univ Bordeaux 2, F-33076 Bordeaux, France::Schemann, Jean-Francois@Inst Rech Dev, Dakar, Senegal::Afonso, Filipe@SYROKKO, Aeropole, F-95731 Roissy, France::Haddad, Raja@Univ Paris 09, SYROKKO, F-75016 Paris, France@Univ Paris 09, LAMSADE, F-75016 Paris, France::Diday, Edwin@Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, F-75016 Paris, France","Guinot, Christiane@Universite de Tours@Centre-Val de Loire (ComUE)::Malvy, Denis@Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine (ComUE)@CHU Bordeaux@Universite de Bordeaux::Schemann, Jean-Francois@Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD)::Afonso, Filipe@Unknow::Haddad, Raja@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@Universite Paris-Dauphine::Diday, Edwin@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@Universite Paris-Dauphine",not exist,"no title+Afonso, F; Haddad, R; Toque, C<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Eliezer, ES; Diday, E</span>.+User manual of the SYR Software+2014::From the statistics of data to the statistics of knowledge: Symbolic data analysis+Billard, L; Diday, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2003::no title+Billard, L; Diday, E.+Symbolic Data Analysis: Conceptual Statistics and Data Mining+2006::Analysis of symbolic data+Bock, H; Diday, E.+Exploratory methods for extracting statistical information from complex data+2000::no title+DIDAY E+REV NOUVELLES TECH E+2013::no title+Diday, E; Noirhomme-Fraiture, M.+Symbolic Data Analysis and the SODAS software+2008::Principal Component Analysis for Categorical Histogram Data: Some Open Directions of Research+Diday, Edwin+CLASSIFICATION AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS FOR COMPLEX DATA STRUCTURES+2011::Principal Component Analysis for Bar Charts and Metabins Tables+Diday, Edwin+STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING+OCT 2013::no title+Hosmer, D; Lemeshow, S.+Applied logistic regression+2000::AN INSIGHT ON THE USE OF MULTIPLE LOGISTIC-REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN RISK FACTOR AND DISEASE OCCURRENCE+LEE, J+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAR 1986::Longitudinal evaluation of three azithromycin distribution strategies for treatment of trachoma in a sub-Saharan African country, Mali+Schemann, J. -F.; Guinot, C.; Traore, L.; et al.+ACTA TROPICA+JAN 2007::Logistic regression based pattern classifiers for symbolic interval data+Souza, RMCR; Queiroz, DCF; Cysneiros, FJA.+Pattern Anal Appl+2011::no title+no author+Coding instructions for the WHO/PBL eye examination record (version III)+1988"
Lasso-constrained regression analysis for interval-valued data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0164-8,MAR 2015,20,7,"A new method of regression analysis for interval-valued data is proposed. The relationship between an interval-valued response variable and a set of interval-valued explanatory variables is investigated by considering two regression models, one for the midpoints and the other one for the radii. The estimation problem is approached by introducing Lasso-based constraints on the regression coefficients. This can improve the prediction accuracy of the model and, taking into account the nature of the constraints, can sometimes produce a parsimonious model with a common subset of regression coefficients for the midpoint and the radius models. The effectiveness of our method, called Lasso-IR (Lasso-based Interval-valued Regression), is shown by a simulation experiment and some applications to real data.","Interval-valued data,Regression,Lasso,Prediction accuracy","MODEL,SETS,COMPACT","Giordani, Paolo@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat Sci, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Giordani, Paolo@Sapienza University Rome","Giordani, Paolo@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4091-3165","A resampling approach for interval-valued data regression+Ahn, J.; Peng, M.; Park, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Jeon, Y</span>.+Statistical Analysis and Data Mining+2012::no title+[Anonymous].+SYMBOLIC DATA ANAL S+2008::Regression analysis for interval-valued data+Billard, L; Diday, E+DATA ANALYSIS, CLASSIFICATION, AND RELATED METHODS+2000::From the statistics of data to the statistics of knowledge: Symbolic data analysis+Billard, L; Diday, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2003::no title+Billard, L; Diday, E.+Symbolic Data Analysis: Conceptual Statistics and Data Mining+2007::Estimation of a flexible simple linear model for interval data based on set arithmetic+Blanco-Fernandez, Angela; Corral, Norberto; Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Gil+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 1 2011::Confidence sets in a linear regression model for interval data+Blanco-Fernandez, Angela; Colubi, Ana; Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Gil+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 2012::no title+Bock, Hans Hermann.+Analysis of Symbolic Data: Exploratory Methods for Extracting Statistical Information from Complex Data+2000::Far beyond the classical data models: symbolic data analysis+Brito, P; Noirhomme-Fraiture, M.+Stat Anal Data Min+2011::Arobustmethod for linear regression of symbolic interval data+Domingues, MAO; de Souza RMCR; Cysneiros, FJA.+Patt Rec Lett+2010::no title+Efron, B.+An Introduction to the Bootstrap+1993::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::no title+Gill, PE; Murray, W; Wright, MH.+Practical optimization+1981::Least squares estimation of linear regression models for convex compact random sets+Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Gil; Blanco, Angela; Corral, Norberto; et al.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+MAR 2007::Solving Least Squares Problems+Lawson, Charles L; Hanson, Richard J.+Classics in Applied Mathematics+1995::Constrained linear regression models for symbolic interval-valued variablesk+Lima Neto, Eufrasio de A.; de Carvalho, Francisco de A.

Linear regression for numeric symbolic variables: a least squares approach based on Wasserstein Distance,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0197-7,MAR 2015,31,3,"In this paper we present a new linear regression technique for distributional symbolic variables, i.e., variables whose realizations can be histograms, empirical distributions or empirical estimates of parametric distributions. Such data are known as numerical modal data according to the Symbolic Data Analysis definitions. In order to measure the error between the observed and the predicted distributions, the Wasserstein distance is proposed. Some properties of such a metric are exploited to predict the modal response variable as a linear combination of the explanatory modal variables. Based on the metric, the model uses the quantile functions associated with the data and thus is subject to a positivity constraint of the estimated parameters. We propose solving the linear regression problem by starting from a particular decomposition of the squared distance. Therefore, we estimate the model parameters according to two separate models, one for the averages of the data and one for the centered distributions by a constrained least squares algorithm. Measures of goodness-of-fit are also proposed and discussed. The method is validated by two applications, one on simulated data and one on two real-world datasets.","Modal symbolic variables,Probability distribution function,Histogram data,Regression,Wasserstein distance",,"Irpino, Antonio@Univ Naples 2, Dept Polit Sci J Monnet, I-81100 Caserta, Italy::Verde, Rosanna@Univ Naples 2, Dept Polit Sci J Monnet, I-81100 Caserta, Italy","Irpino, Antonio@Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli::Verde, Rosanna@Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli","Irpino, Antonio@G-6775-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9293-7180::VERDE, Rosanna@P-5004-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9959-4675","Forecasting histogram time series with k-nearest neighbours methods+Arroyo, Javier; Mate, Carlos+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JAN-MAR 2009::Descriptive statistics for symbolic data+Bertrand, P.; Goupil, F.+Analysis of symbolic data+2000::SOME ASYMPTOTIC THEORY FOR THE BOOTSTRAP+BICKEL, PJ; FREEDMAN, DA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::Regression analysis for interval-valued data+Billard, L; Diday, E+DATA ANALYSIS, CLASSIFICATION, AND RELATED METHODS+2000::no title+Billard, L; Diday, E.+Symbolic Data Analysis: Conceptual Statistics and Data Mining+2006::no title+Bock, Hans Hermann.+Analysis of Symbolic Data: Exploratory Methods for Extracting Statistical Information from Complex Data+2000::Sugli estremi dei momenti delle funzioni di ripartizione doppia+Dall'Aglio, G.+Ann Sci Norm Super Di Pisa Cl Sci+1956::A new linear regression model for histogram-valued variables+Dias, S; Brito, P.+58 ISI WORLD STAT C+2011::no title+Diday, E; Noirhomme-Fraiture, M.+Symbolic Data Analysis and the SODAS software+2008::Assessment of ozone variations and meteorological effects in an urban area in the Mediterranean Coast+Duenas, C; Fernandez, MC; Canete, S; et al.+SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT+NOV 1 2002::no title+Efron, B.+An Introduction to the Bootstrap+1993::no title+Gilchrist, W.

A comparison of five recursive partitioning methods to find person subgroups involved in meaningful treatment-subgroup interactions,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0159-x,DEC 2014,24,17,"In case multiple treatment alternatives are available for some medical problem, the detection of treatment-subgroup interactions (i.e., relative treatment effectiveness varying over subgroups of persons) is of key importance for personalized medicine and the development of optimal treatment assignment strategies. Randomized Clinical Trials (RCT) often go without clear a priori hypotheses on the subgroups involved in treatment-subgroup interactions, and with a large number of pre-treatment characteristics in the data. In such situations, relevant subgroups (defined in terms of pre-treatment characteristics) are to be induced during the actual data analysis. This comes down to a problem of cluster analysis, with the goal of this analysis being to find clusters of persons that are involved in meaningful treatment-person cluster interactions. For such a cluster analysis, five recently proposed methods can be used, all being of a recursive partitioning type. However, these five methods have been developed almost independently, and the relations between them are not yet understood. The present paper closes this gap. It starts by outlining the basic principles behind each method, and by illustrating it with an application on an RCT data set on two treatment strategies for substance abuse problems. Next, it presents a comparison of the methods, hereby focusing on major similarities and differences. The discussion concludes with practical advice for end users with regard to the selection of a suitable method, and with an important challenge for future research in this area.","Treatment heterogeneity,Recursive partitioning,Subgroup analysis,Treatment-subgroup interaction","SUBSTANCE-ABUSE,IDENTIFICATION,TRIALS,TREES","Doove, L.

A latent class analysis of the public attitude towards the euro adoption in Poland,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0156-0,DEC 2014,30,3,"Latent class analysis can be viewed as a special case of model-based clustering for multivariate discrete data. It is assumed that each observation comes from one of a number of classes, groups or subpopulations, with its own probability distribution. The overall population thus follows a finite mixture model. When observed, data take the form of categorical responses-as, for example, in public opinion or consumer behavior surveys it is often of interest to identify and characterize clusters of similar objects. In the context of marketing research, one will typically interpret the latent number of mixture components as clusters or segments. In fact, LC analysis provides a powerful new tool to identify important market segments in target marketing. We used the model based clustering approach for grouping and detecting inhomogeneities of Polish opinions on the euro adoption. We analyzed data collected as part of the Polish General Social Survey using the R software.","Latent class analysis,Mixture model,Categorical data,Euro adoption","DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,EM ALGORITHM,MODELS","Genge, Ewa@Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat, PL-40226 Katowice, Poland","Genge, Ewa@University of Economics in Katowice","Genge, Ewa@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8899-3697","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Latent variable regression for multiple discrete outcomes+Bandeen-Roche, K; Miglioretti, DL; Zeger, SL<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rathouz, PJ</span>.+J Am Stat Assoc+1997::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::Choosing models in model-based clustering and discriminant analysis+Biernacki, C; Govaert, G+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1999::no title+Cichomski, B; Jerzynski, T.+Polskie Generalne Sondaze Spoleczne: skumulowany komputerowy zbior danych 1992-2008+2009::New developments in latent structure analysis+Clogg, C.

Feature selection for fault level diagnosis of planetary gearboxes,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0168-4,DEC 2014,38,7,"Feature selection is critical to maintain high performance of classification-based fault diagnosis with a large feature size. In this paper, we propose a criterion to evaluate features effectiveness by class separability that is defined on cosine similarity in the kernel space of the Gaussian radial basis function. We develop a feature selection algorithm accordingly using the proposed criterion together with sequential backward selection and a feature re-ranking mechanism. We then employ the proposed feature selection algorithm to determine fault-sensitive features and select them for fault level diagnosis of planetary gearboxes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the feature size and improve accuracy of fault level diagnosis simultaneously.","Fault diagnosis,Feature selection,Class separability,Cosine similarity,Planetary gearbox","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES,FEATURE-EXTRACTION,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHM,VIBRATION","Liu, Zhiliang@Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Mech Elect & Ind Engn, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China::Zhao, Xiaomin@Univ Alberta, Dept Mech Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G8, Canada::Zuo, Ming J.@Univ Alberta, Dept Mech Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G8, Canada@Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Mech Elect & Ind Engn, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China::Xu, Hongbing@Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Automat Engn, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China","Liu, Zhiliang@University of Electronic Science & Technology of China::Zhao, Xiaomin@University of Alberta::Zuo, Ming J.@University of Alberta@University of Electronic Science & Technology of China::Xu, Hongbing@University of Electronic Science & Technology of China","Zuo, Mingjian@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8607-2923","Access structures for angular similarity queries+Apaydin, Tan; Ferhatosmanoglu, Hakan+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING+NOV 2006::SRDA: An efficient algorithm for large-scale discriminant analysis+Cai, Deng; He, Xiaofei; Han, Jiawei+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING+JAN 2008::Combination of feature selection approaches with SVM in credit scoring+Chen, Fei-Long; Li, Feng-Chia+EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS+JUL 2010::no title+Chong, E.

Functional data clustering: a survey,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0158-y,SEP 2014,68,36,"Clustering techniques for functional data are reviewed. Four groups of clustering algorithms for functional data are proposed. The first group consists of methods working directly on the evaluation points of the curves. The second groups is defined by filtering methods which first approximate the curves into a finite basis of functions and second perform clustering using the basis expansion coefficients. The third groups is composed of methods which perform simultaneously dimensionality reduction of the curves and clustering, leading to functional representation of data depending on clusters.

Spatial functional normal mixed effect approach for curve classification,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0174-6,SEP 2014,67,2,"This paper proposes a spatial functional formulation of the normal mixed effect model for the statistical classification of spatially dependent Gaussian curves, in both parametric and state space model frameworks. Fixed effect parameters are represented in terms of a functional multiple regression model whose regression operators can change in space. Local spatial homogeneity of these operators is measured in terms of their Hilbert-Schmidt distances, leading to the classification of fixed effect curves in different groups. Assuming that the Gaussian random effect curves obey a spatial autoregressive dynamics of order one [SARH(1) dynamics], a second functional classification criterion is proposed in order to detect local spatially homogeneous patterns in the mean quadratic functional variation of Gaussian random effect curve increments. Finally, the two criteria are combined to detect local spatially homogeneous patterns in the regression operators and in the functional mean quadratic variation, under a state space approach. A real data example in the financial context is analyzed as an illustration.","Empirical functional variogram,Firm financial structure,Functional multiple regression,Spatial functional mixed effect models,Spatial Hilbert-valued Gaussian processes","HILBERTIAN PROCESSES,LONGITUDINAL DATA,LOGIT REGRESSION,PREDICTION,MODELS,DISCRIMINATION,SPLINES","Ruiz-Medina, Maria D.@Univ Granada, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Granada, Spain::Espejo, Rosa M.@Univ Granada, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Granada, Spain::Romano, Elvira@Univ Naples 2, Dept Polit Sci Jean Monnet, Caserta, Italy","Ruiz-Medina, Maria D.@University of Granada::Espejo, Rosa M.@University of Granada::Romano, Elvira@Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli","Ruiz-Medina, Maria Dolores@H-5582-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7445-7060::Espejo, Rosa@I-4084-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7904-2059::Romano, Elvira@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8998-7099","Aligning gene expression time series with time warping algorithms+Aach, J; Church, GM+BIOINFORMATICS+JUN 2001::Unsupervised curve clustering using B-splines+Abraham, C; Cornillon, PA; Matzner-Lober, E; et al.+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2003::Using basis expansions for estimating functional PLS regression Applications with chemometric data+Aguilera, Ana M.; Escabias, Manuel; Preda, Cristian; et al.+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+DEC 15 2010::Supervised classification for functional data: A weighted distance approach+Alonso, Andres M.; Casado, David; Romo, Juan+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUL 2012::Wavelet regression estimation in nonparametric mixed effect models+Angelini, C; De Canditiis, D; Leblanc, F+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAY 2003::no title+[Anonymous].+BIOMETRICS+no time::Supervised classification for functional data: A theoretical remark and some numerical comparisons+Baillo, Amparo; Cuevas, Antonio+FUNCTIONAL AND OPERATORIAL STATISTICS+2008::Bayesian hierarchical spatially correlated functional data analysis with application to colon carcinogenesis+Baladandayuthapani, Veerabhadran; Mallick, Bani K.; Hong, Mee Young; et al.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2008::no title+Basse, M; Diop, A; Dabo-Niang, S.+Mean square properties of a class of kernel density estimates for spatial functional random variables+2008::Functional supervised classification with wavelets+Berlinet, A; Biau, G; Rouviere, L.+Ann lISUP+2008::Functional classification in Hilbert spaces+Biau, G; Bunea, F; Wegkamp, MH.+IEEE Trans Inf Theor+2003::Capital structures in developing countries+Booth, L; Aivazian, V; Demirguc-Kunt, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+FEB 2001::Penalized spline approaches for functional logit regression+Carmen Aguilera-Morillo, M.; Aguilera, Ana M.; Escabias, Manuel; et al.+TEST+JUN 2013::Functional clustering of longitudinal data+Chiou, Jeng-Min; Li, Pai-Ling+FUNCTIONAL AND OPERATORIAL STATISTICS+2008::Correlation-Based Functional Clustering via Subspace Projection+Chiou, Jeng-Min; Li, Pai-Ling+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2008::Functional clustering and identifying substructures of longitudinal data+Chiou, Jeng-Min; Li, Pai-Ling+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2007::Impartial trimmed k-means for functional data+Cuesta-Albertos, Juan Antonio; Fraiman, Ricardo+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 15 2007::no title+Daubechies, I.+10 LECT WAVELETS+1992::Mathematical analysis and numerical methods for science and technology+Dautray, R; Lions, JL.+Spectral theory and applications+1985::The impact of firm and industry characteristics on small firms' capital structure+Degryse, Hans; de Goeij, Peter; Kappert, Peter+SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS+MAY 2012::Componentwise classification and clustering of functional data+Delaigle, A.; Hall, P.; Bathia, N.+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2012::METHODOLOGY AND THEORY FOR PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES APPLIED TO FUNCTIONAL DATA+Delaigle, Aurore; Hall, Peter+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2012::Achieving near perfect classification for functional data+Delaigle, Aurore; Hall, Peter+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2012::Statistics for spatial functional data: some recent contributions+Delicado, P.; Giraldo, R.; Comas, C.; et al.+ENVIRONMETRICS+MAY-JUN 2010::Unconditional bases are optimal bases for data compression and for statistical estimation+Donoho, DL.+J Appl Comput Harmon Anal+1993::Functional PLS logit regression model+Escabias, M.; Aguilera, A.

The analyses show that principal differential analysis can provide an alternative and effective representation of functional data, easily interpretable in terms of exponential, sinusoidal, or damped-sinusoidal functions and providing a different insight to the functional data set under investigation.

Simplicial band depth for multivariate functional data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0166-6,SEP 2014,23,17,"We propose notions of simplicial band depth for multivariate functional data that extend the univariate functional band depth. The proposed simplicial band depths provide simple and natural criteria to measure the centrality of a trajectory within a sample of curves. Based on these depths, a sample of multivariate curves can be ordered from the center outward and order statistics can be defined. Properties of the proposed depths, such as invariance and consistency, can be established. A simulation study shows the robustness of this new definition of depth and the advantages of using a multivariate depth versus the marginal depths for detecting outliers. Real data examples from growth curves and signature data are used to illustrate the performance and usefulness of the proposed depths.","Band depth,Functional boxplot,Functional and image data,Modified band depth,Multivariate,Simplicial","CROSS-COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS,RANDOM-FIELDS","Lopez-Pintado, Sara@Columbia Univ, Dept Biostat, New York, NY 10032 USA::Sun, Ying@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Lin, Juan K.@SearchForce Inc, San Mateo, CA 94403 USA::Genton, Marc G.@King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, CEMSE Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia","Lopez-Pintado, Sara@Columbia University::Sun, Ying@Ohio State University::Lin, Juan K.@Unknow::Genton, Marc G.@King Abdullah University of Science & Technology","Sun, Ying@N-2009-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6703-4270::Genton, Marc Georges@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6467-2998","A Valid Matern Class of Cross-Covariance Functions for Multivariate Random Fields With Any Number of Components+Apanasovich, Tatiyana V.; Genton, Marc G.; Sun, Ying+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2012::On algorithms for simplicial depth+Cheng, A; Ouyang, M.+P 13 CAN C COMP GEOM+2001::Robust estimation and classification for functional data via projection-based depth notions+Cuevas, Antonio; Febrero, Manuel; Fraiman, Ricardo+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+SEP 2007::no title+Ferraty, F.; Vieu, P.+Nonparametric Functional Data Analysis+2006::Trimmed means for functional data+Fraiman, R; Muniz, G+TEST+DEC 2001::Surface boxplots+Genton, Marc G.; Johnson, Christopher; Potter, Kristin; et al.+STAT+2014::OUTLIER DETECTION AND TRIMMED ESTIMATION FOR GENERAL FUNCTIONAL DATA+Gervini, Daniel+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2012::Matern Cross-Covariance Functions for Multivariate Random Fields+Gneiting, Tilmann; Kleiber, William; Schlather, Martin+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2010::Depth Measures for Multivariate Functional Data+Ieva, Francesca; Paganoni, Anna M.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+APR 1 2013::ON A NOTION OF DATA DEPTH BASED ON RANDOM SIMPLICES+LIU, RY+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1990::Functional data analysis via extensions of the band depth, IMS lecture Notes-Monograph Series+Lopez-Pintado, S; Jornsten, R.+Inst Math Stat+2007::Depth-based inference for functional data+Lopez-Pintado, Sara; Romo, Juan+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 15 2007::On the Concept of Depth for Functional Data+Lopez-Pintado, Sara; Romo, Juan+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2009::Depth for Sparse Functional Data+Lopez-Pintado, Sara; Wei, Ying+RECENT ADVANCES IN FUNCTIONAL DATA ANALYSIS AND RELATED TOPICS+2011::no title+Matern, B.+Spatial Variation+1960::no title+Ramsay, J.

New insights on permutation approach for hypothesis testing on functional data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0162-2,SEP 2014,32,7,"The permutation approach for testing the equality of distributions and thereby comparing two populations of functional data has recently received increasing attention thanks to the flexibility of permutation tests to handle complex testing problems. The purpose of this work is to present some new insights in the context of nonparametric inference on functional data using the permutation approach, more specifically we formally show the equivalence of some permutation procedures proposed in the literature and we suggest the use of the permutation and combination-based approach within the basis function approximation layout.

A comparison of some criteria for states selection in the latent Markov model for longitudinal data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0154-2,JUN 2014,38,19,"We compare different selection criteria to choose the number of latent states of a multivariate latent Markov model for longitudinal data. This model is based on an underlying Markov chain to represent the evolution of a latent characteristic of a group of individuals over time. Then, the response variables observed at different occasions are assumed to be conditionally independent given this chain. Maximum likelihood estimation of the model is carried out through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based on forward-backward recursions which are well known in the hidden Markov literature for time series. The selection criteria we consider are based on penalized versions of the maximum log-likelihood or on the posterior probabilities of belonging to each latent state, that is, the conditional probability of the latent state given the observed data. Among the latter criteria, we propose an appropriate entropy measure tailored for the latent Markov models. We show the results of a Monte Carlo simulation study aimed at comparing the performance of the above states selection criteria on the basis of a wide set of model specifications.","Akaike information criterion,Bayesian information criterion,Entropy,Mixture model,Multivariate latent Markov model,Normalized entropy criterion","MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION,MIXTURE MODEL,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,EM ALGORITHM,LIKELIHOOD,NUMBER,CLUSTERS,ENTROPY","Bacci, S.@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06100 Perugia, Italy::Pandolfi, S.@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06100 Perugia, Italy::Pennoni, F.@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat & Quantit Methods, Milan, Italy","Bacci, S.@University of Perugia::Pandolfi, S.@University of Perugia::Pennoni, F.@University of Milano-Bicocca",not exist,"Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::Likelihood inference for a class of latent Markov models under linear hypotheses on the transition probabilities+Bartolucci, F+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::no title+Bartolucci, F.; Farcomeni, A.; Pennoni, F.+Latent Markov Models for Longitudinal Data+2013::A latent Markov model for detecting patterns of criminal activity+Bartolucci, Francesco; Pennoni, Fulvia; Francis, Brian+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2007::A MAXIMIZATION TECHNIQUE OCCURRING IN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS OF MARKOV CHAINS+BAUM, LE; PETRIE, T; SOULES, G; et al.+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1970::Using the classification likelihood to choose the number of clusters+Biernacki, C; Govaert, G.+Comput Sci Stat+1997::Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2000::Choosing models in model-based clustering and discriminant analysis+Biernacki, C; Govaert, G+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1999::An improvement of the NEC criterion for assessing the number of clusters in a mixture model+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+MAR 1999::Choosing the number of component clusters in the micture-model using a new informational complexity criterion of the Inverse-Fisher Information Matrix+Bozdogan, H.+Information and classification, concepts, methods and applications+1993::MODEL SELECTION AND AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) - THE GENERAL-THEORY AND ITS ANALYTICAL EXTENSIONS+BOZDOGAN, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::An entropy criterion for assessing the number of clusters in a mixture model+Celeux, G; Soromenho, G+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1996::Selecting hidden Markov model state number with cross-validated likelihood+Celeux, Gilles; Durand, Jean-Baptiste+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+OCT 2008::no title+Costa, M; De Angelis, L.+Model selection in hidden Markov models: a simulation study+2010::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Model selection for the binary latent class model: A Monte Carlo simulation+Dias, Jose G.+DATA SCIENCE AND CLASSIFICATION+2006::Localizing the latent structure canonical uncertainty: entropy profiles for hidden Markov models+Durand, JB; Guedon, Y.+Tech. rep., Research Report 7896+2012::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::EXPLORATORY LATENT STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS USING BOTH IDENTIFIABLE AND UNIDENTIFIABLE MODELS+GOODMAN, LA+BIOMETRIKA+1974::ANOTHER INTERPRETATION OF THE EM ALGORITHM FOR MIXTURE DISTRIBUTIONS+HATHAWAY, RJ+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAR 1986::Efficient computation of the hidden Markov model entropy for a given observation sequence+Hernando, D; Crespi, V; Cybenko, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+JUL 2005::A corrected Akaike Information Criterion for vector autoregressive model selection+Hurvich, C.

Graphical tools for model-based mixture discriminant analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0147-1,JUN 2014,33,5,"The paper introduces a methodology for visualizing on a dimension reduced subspace the classification structure and the geometric characteristics induced by an estimated Gaussian mixture model for discriminant analysis. In particular, we consider the case of mixture of mixture models with varying parametrization which allow for parsimonious models. The approach is an extension of an existing work on reducing dimensionality for model-based clustering based on Gaussian mixtures. Information on the dimension reduction subspace is provided by the variation on class locations and, depending on the estimated mixture model, on the variation on class dispersions. Projections along the estimated directions provide summary plots which help to visualize the structure of the classes and their characteristics. A suitable modification of the method allows us to recover the most discriminant directions, i.e., those that show maximal separation among classes. The approach is illustrated using simulated and real data.","Dimension reduction,Model-based discriminant analysis,Gaussian mixtures,Canonical variates for mixture modeling","SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION,DIMENSION REDUCTION,CLASSIFICATION,LIKELIHOOD,DISCOVERY","Scrucca, Luca@Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Econ Finanza & Stat, I-06123 Perugia, Italy","Scrucca, Luca@University of Perugia","Scrucca, Luca@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3826-0484","MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Regularized Gaussian discriminant analysis through eigenvalue decomposition+Bensmail, H; Celeux, G+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::no title+Bibby, J.M; Kent, J.T; Mardia, K.V.+Multivariate Analysis+1979::Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2000::Model-based clustering of high-dimensional data: A review+Bouveyron, Charles; Brunet-Saumard, Camille+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 2014::no title+Breiman, L; Friedman, J; Stone, CJ<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Olshen, RA</span>.+Classification and regression trees+1984::GAUSSIAN PARSIMONIOUS CLUSTERING MODELS+CELEUX, G; GOVAERT, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION+MAY 1995::Generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis via the approach of sliced inverse regression+Chen, C-H; Li, K-C.+Journal of the Korean Statistical Society.+2001::Likelihood-based sufficient dimension reduction+Cook, DR; Forzani, L.+J Am Stat Assoc+2009::SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION FOR DIMENSION REDUCTION - COMMENT+COOK, RD; WEISBERG, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1991::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Comparison of discrimination methods for the classification of tumors using gene expression data+Dudoit, S; Fridlyand, J; Speed, TP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2002::The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems+Fisher, RA+ANNALS OF EUGENICS+SEP 1936::no title+FLURY, B.+Multivariate statistics: a practical approach+1988::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::mclust version 4 for R: normal mixture modeling for model- based clustering, classification, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE; Murphy, TB<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Scrucca, L</span>.+Technical.

Variational Bayes approximations for clustering via mixtures of normal inverse Gaussian distributions,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0165-7,JUN 2014,55,11,Parameter estimation for model-based clustering using a finite mixture of normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) distributions is achieved through variational Bayes approximations. Univariate NIG mixtures and multivariate NIG mixtures are considered. The use of variational Bayes approximations here is a substantial departure from the traditional EM approach and alleviates some of the associated computational complexities and uncertainties. Our variational algorithm is applied to simulated and real data.

Threshold optimization for classification in imbalanced data in a problem of gamma-ray astronomy,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0167-5,JUN 2014,40,1,"We introduce a method to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of an estimator which is derived from a classification. The method chooses an optimal discrimination threshold in the outcome of a classification algorithm and deals with the problem of unequal and unknown misclassification costs and class imbalance. The approach is applied to data from the MAGIC experiment in astronomy for choosing an optimal threshold for signal-background-separation. In this application one is interested in estimating the number of signal events in a dataset with very unfavorable signal to background ratio. Minimizing the MSE of the estimation is a rather general approach which can be adapted to various other applications, in which one wants to derive an estimator from a classification. If the classification depends on other or additional parameters than the discrimination threshold, MSE minimization can be used to optimize these parameters as well. We illustrate this by optimizing the parameters of logistic regression, leading to relevant improvements of the current approach used in the MAGIC experiment.","Classification,Thresholding,MAGIC,Imbalanced data,Unknown misclassification costs,Random forest","ATMOSPHERIC CHERENKOV TELESCOPES,GAMMA/HADRON SEPARATION,PERFORMANCE","Voigt, Tobias@TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Stat, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany::Fried, Roland@TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Stat, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany::Backes, Michael@Univ Namibia, Dept Phys, Windhoek, Namibia@TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Stat, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany::Rhode, Wolfgang@TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Stat, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany","Voigt, Tobias@Dortmund University of Technology::Fried, Roland@Dortmund University of Technology::Backes, Michael@University of Namibia@Dortmund University of Technology::Rhode, Wolfgang@Dortmund University of Technology","Backes, Michael@N-5126-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9326-6400","no title+Aharonian, F.+Very High Energy Cosmic Gamma Radiation: a Crucial Window on the Extreme Universe+2004::Implementation of the Random Forest method for the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope MAGIC+Albert, J.; Aliu, E.; Anderhub, H.; et al.+NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS &amp; METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT+APR 11 2008::Unfolding of differential energy spectra in the MAGIC experiment+Albert, J.; Aliu, E.; Anderhub, H.; et al.+NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS &amp; METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT+DEC 21 2007::MAGIC TeV gamma-ray observations of Markarian 421 during multiwavelength campaigns in 2006+Aleksic, J.; Anderhub, H.; Antonelli, L.

A LASSO-penalized BIC for mixture model selection,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0155-1,MAR 2014,44,5,"The efficacy of family-based approaches to mixture model-based clustering and classification depends on the selection of parsimonious models. Current wisdom suggests the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for mixture model selection. However, the BIC has well-known limitations, including a tendency to overestimate the number of components as well as a proclivity for underestimating, often drastically, the number of components in higher dimensions. While the former problem might be soluble by merging components, the latter is impossible to mitigate in clustering and classification applications. In this paper, a LASSO-penalized BIC (LPBIC) is introduced to overcome this problem. This approach is illustrated based on applications of extensions of mixtures of factor analyzers, where the LPBIC is used to select both the number of components and the number of latent factors.

Classification of brain activation via spatial Bayesian variable selection in fMRI regression,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0142-6,MAR 2014,25,6,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the most popular technique in human brain mapping, with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) as a classical benchmark tool for detecting brain activity. Smith and Fahrmeir (J Am Stat Assoc 102(478): 417-431, 2007) proposed a competing method based on a spatial Bayesian variable selection in voxelwise linear regressions, with an Ising prior for latent activation indicators. In this article, we alternatively link activation probabilities to two types of latent Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) via a probit model. Statistical inference in resulting high-dimensional hierarchical models is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, providing posterior estimates of activation probabilities and enhancing formation of activation clusters. Three algorithms are proposed depending on GMRF type and update scheme. An application to an active acoustic oddball experiment and a simulation study show a substantial increase in sensitivity compared to existing fMRI activation detection methods like classical SPM and the Ising model.","Functional magnetic resonance imaging,Bayesian image analysis,Human brain mapping,Probit link,Markov random field priors,Markov chain Monte Carlo","MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS,AUTOREGRESSIVE GAUSSIAN PROCESS,GENE-EXPRESSION,MODEL","Kalus, Stefanie@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Saemann, Philipp G.@Max Planck Inst Psychiat, D-80804 Munich, Germany::Fahrmeir, Ludwig@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Kalus, Stefanie@University of Munich::Saemann, Philipp G.@Max Planck Society::Fahrmeir, Ludwig@University of Munich",not exist,"no title+Andersen, E.; Bai, Z.; Bischof, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Demmel, J.; Dongarra, J.; Greenbaum, A.; Hammarling, S.; McKenney, A.; Ostrouchev, S.; Sorensen, D</span>.+LAPACK users' guide+1999::Optimal predictive model selection+Barbieri, MM; Berger, JO+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::An updated set of Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)+Blackford, LS; Demmel, J; Dongarra, J; et al.+ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE+JUN 2002::Adaptive Gaussian Markov random fields with applications in human brain mapping+Brezger, A.; Fahrmeir, L.; Hennerfeind, A.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2007::Modifying a sparse Cholesky factorization+Davis, TA; Hager, WW+SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS+JUL 13 1999::no title+Friston, K.

Mixtures of biased sentiment analysers,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0150-6,MAR 2014,32,2,"Modelling bias is an important consideration when dealing with inexpert annotations. We are concerned with training a classifier to perform sentiment analysis on news media articles, some of which have been manually annotated by volunteers. The classifier is trained on the words in the articles and then applied to non-annotated articles. In previous work we found that a joint estimation of the annotator biases and the classifier parameters performed better than estimation of the biases followed by training of the classifier. An important question follows from this result: can the annotators be usefully clustered into either predetermined or data-driven clusters, based on their biases? If so, such a clustering could be used to select, drop or otherwise categorise the annotators in a crowdsourcing task. This paper presents work on fitting a finite mixture model to the annotators' bias. We develop a model and an algorithm and demonstrate its properties on simulated data. We then demonstrate the clustering that exists in our motivating dataset, namely the analysis of potentially economically relevant news articles from Irish online news sources.","Bias modelling,Crowdsourcing,EM algorithm,Mixture model,Sentiment analysis","EM ALGORITHM,MODEL,CRITERION,CLUSTERS,NUMBER,BAYES","Salter-Townshend, Michael@Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland@Univ Coll Dublin, Complex & Adapt Syst Lab, Dublin 4, Ireland::Murphy, Thomas Brendan@Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland@Univ Coll Dublin, Complex & Adapt Syst Lab, Dublin 4, Ireland","Salter-Townshend, Michael@University College Dublin::Murphy, Thomas Brendan@University College Dublin","Salter-Townshend, Michael@I-1763-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6232-9109::Murphy, Thomas Brendan@H-4366-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5668-7046","no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::An improvement of the NEC criterion for assessing the number of clusters in a mixture model+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+MAR 1999::Biographies, bollywood, boom-boxes and blenders: Domain adaptation for sentiment classification+Blitzer, J.; Dredze, M.; Pereira, F.+Acl+2007::Twitter Mood as a Stock Market Predictor+Bollen, J.; Huina Mao+Computer+Oct. 2011::Using Crowdsourcing and Active Learning to Track Sentiment in Online Media+Brew, A.; Greene, D.; Cunnigham, P.+P 19 EUR C ART INT E+2010::The interaction between supervised learning and crowdsourcing+Brew, A; Greene, D; Cunningham, P.+NIPS WORKSH COMP SOC+2010::An entropy criterion for assessing the number of clusters in a mixture model+Celeux, G; Soromenho, G+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1996::Maximum likelihood estimation of observer error-rates using the EM algorithm+Dawid, A.

Latent class CUB models,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0143-5,MAR 2014,28,9,"The paper proposes a latent class version of Combination of Uniform and (shifted) Binomial random variables (CUB) models for ordinal data to account for unobserved heterogeneity. The extension, called LC-CUB, is useful when the heterogeneity is originated by clusters of respondents not identified by covariates: this may generate a multimodal response distribution, which cannot be adequately described by a standard CUB model. The LC-CUB model is a finite mixture of CUB models yielding a multimodal theoretical distribution. Model identification is achieved by constraining the uncertainty parameters to be constant across latent classes. A simulation experiment shows the performance of the maximum likelihood estimator, whereas the usefulness of the approach is illustrated by means of a case study on political self-placement measured on an ordinal scale.","Finite mixture,Maximum likelihood,Ordinal data,Simulation,Unobserved heterogeneity",MIXTURE-MODELS,"Grilli, Leonardo@G Parenti Univ Florence, DiSIA, Dept Stat, Florence, Italy::Iannario, Maria@Univ Naples Federico II, Dept TEOMESUS, Naples, Italy::Piccolo, Domenico@Univ Naples Federico II, Dept TEOMESUS, Naples, Italy::Rampichini, Carla@G Parenti Univ Florence, DiSIA, Dept Stat, Florence, Italy","Grilli, Leonardo@University of Florence::Iannario, Maria@University of Naples Federico II::Piccolo, Domenico@University of Naples Federico II::Rampichini, Carla@University of Florence","Grilli, Leonardo@P-2282-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3886-7705::PICCOLO, Domenico@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5198-1078","no title+AGRESTI, ALAN.+Analysis of ordinal categorical data+2010::A mixture model for preferences data analysis+D'Elia, A; Piccolo, D+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 1 2005::no title+Davison, AC; Hinkley, DV.+Bootstrap methods and their applications+1997::CONCOMITANT-VARIABLE LATENT-CLASS MODELS+DAYTON, CM; MACREADY, GB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1988::no title+Efron, B.+An Introduction to the Bootstrap+1993::Measuring Job Satisfaction with CUB Models+Gambacorta, Romina; Iannario, Maria+LABOUR-ENGLAND+JUN 2013::no title+Gelman, A; Hill, J.+Data analysis using regression and multilevel hierarchical models+2007::Dealing with label switching in mixture models under genuine multimodality+Gruen, Bettina; Leisch, Friedrich+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAY 2009::no title+Hagenaars, JA; McCutcheon, AL.+Applied Latent Class Analysis+2002::CUB models: statistical methods and empirical evidence+Iannario, M.; Piccolo, D.+Modern Analysis of Customer Surveys+2012::Preliminary estimators for a mixture model of ordinal data+Iannario, Maria+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+OCT 2012::Statistical modelling of subjective survival probabilities+Iannario, Maria; Piccolo, Domenico+Genus+MAY-SEP 2010::On the identi ability of a mixture model for ordinal data+Iannario, Maria+METRON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+APR 2010::Modelling shelter choices in a class of mixture models for ordinal responses+Iannario, Maria+STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS+MAR 2012::Local Statistical Modeling via a Cluster-Weighted Approach with Elliptical Distributions+Ingrassia, Salvatore; Minotti, Simona C.; Vittadini, Giorgio+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+OCT 2012::CONSISTENCY OF THE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR IN THE PRESENCE OF INFINITELY MANY INCIDENTAL PARAMETERS+KIEFER, J; WOLFOWITZ, J+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1956::A NOTE ON THE INVESTIGATION OF LOCAL AND GLOBAL IDENTIFIABILITY+MCDONALD, RP+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1982::no title+McLachlan, G; Peel, D.+Finite mixture models+2000::no title+McLachlan, G.; Krishnan, T.+The EM Algorithm and Extensions+2008::Deciding on the number of classes in latent class analysis and growth mixture modeling: A Monte Carlo simulation study+Nylund, Karen L.; Asparoutiov, Tihomir; Muthen, Bengt O.+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+2007::On the moments of a mixture of uniform and shifted binomial random variables.+Piccolo, D.+Quaderni di Stat+2003::Voter choice in multi-party democracies: A test of competing theories and models+Quinn, KM; Martin, AD; Whitford, AB+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE+OCT 1999::no title+no author+SAS/STAT&amp;REG; 9.2 user's guide+2008::Multiparty electoral competition in the Netherlands and Germany: a model based on the multinomial probit+Schofield, N; Martin, AD; Quinn, KM<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Whitford, AB</span>.+Pub Choice+1998::Dealing with label switching in mixture models+Stephens, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::NOTE ON THE CONSISTENCY OF THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATE+WALD, A+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1949::A MIXTURE LIKELIHOOD APPROACH FOR GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+WEDEL, M; DESARBO, WS+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1995::ON WALDS PROOF OF THE CONSISTENCY OF THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATE+WOLFOWITZ, J+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1949"

Lagrangian relaxation and pegging test for the clique partitioning problem,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0135-5,DEC 2013,24,1,"The clique partitioning problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications to data analysis such as clustering. Though a binary integer linear programming formulation has been known for years, one needs to deal with a huge number of variables and constraints when solving a large instance. In this paper, we propose a size reduction algorithm which is based on the Lagrangian relaxation and the pegging test, and verify its validity through numerical experiments. We modify the conventional subgradient method in order to manage the high dimensionality of the Lagrangian multipliers, and also make an improvement on the ordinary pegging test by taking advantage of the structural property of the clique partitioning problem.","Integer programming,Lagrangian relaxation,Clique partitioning,Clustering","GROUP-TECHNOLOGY,KNAPSACK-PROBLEM,ALGORITHM","Sukegawa, Noriyoshi@Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan::Yamamoto, Yoshitsugu@Univ Tsukuba, Fac Engn Informat & Syst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan::Zhang, Liyuan@Univ Tsukuba, Fac Engn Informat & Syst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan","Sukegawa, Noriyoshi@Tokyo Institute of Technology::Yamamoto, Yoshitsugu@University of Tsukuba::Zhang, Liyuan@University of Tsukuba",not exist,"A dynamic subgradient-based branch-and-bound procedure for set covering+Balas, E; Carrera, MC+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+NOV-DEC 1996::Clustering Qualitative Data Based on Binary Equivalence Relations: Neighborhood Search Heuristics for the Clique Partitioning Problem+Brusco, Michael J.; Koehn, Hans-Friedrich+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2009::Production flow analysis for planning group technology+Burbidge, JL.+J Oper Manag+1991::Direct clustering algorithm for group formation in cellular manufacture+Chan, HM; Milner, DA.+J Manuf Syst+1982::Noising methods for a clique partitioning problem+Charon, I; Hudry, O+DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS+APR 1 2006::CLUSTERING AND CLIQUE PARTITIONING - SIMULATED ANNEALING AND TABU SEARCH APPROACHES+DEAMORIM, SG; BARTHELEMY, JP; RIBEIRO, CC+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1992::Fast clustering algorithms+Dorndorf, U.; Pesch, E.+ORSA Journal on Computing+Spring 1994::Modelling robust flight-gate scheduling as a clique partitioning problem+Dorndorf, Ulrich; Jaehn, Florian; Pesch, Erwin+TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE+AUG 2008::THE LAGRANGIAN-RELAXATION METHOD FOR SOLVING INTEGER PROGRAMMING-PROBLEMS+FISHER, ML+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+1981::Lagrangean Relaxation for Integer Programming+Geoffrion, AM.+Mathematical Programming Study+1974::A CUTTING PLANE ALGORITHM FOR A CLUSTERING PROBLEM+GROTSCHEL, M; WAKABAYASHI, Y+MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING+AUG 1989::Consensus of partitions : a constructive approach+Guenoche, Alain+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+OCT 2011::MACHINE-COMPONENT GROUP FORMATION IN GROUP TECHNOLOGY+KING, JR+OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+1980::Clustering of Microarray data via clique partitioning+Kochenberger, G; Glover, F; Alidaee, B; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION+AUG 2005::GROUPING OF PARTS AND COMPONENTS IN FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS+KUMAR, KR; KUSIAK, A; VANNELLI, A+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+MAR 1986::Conditional subgradient optimization - Theory and applications+Larsson, T; Patriksson, M; Stromberg, AB+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+JAN 20 1996::Multiple criteria approach and generation of efficient alternatives for machine-part family formationin group technology+Malakooti, B; Yang, ZY+IIE TRANSACTIONS+SEP 2002::Cliques and clustering: A combinatorial approach+Mehrotra, A; Trick, MA+OPERATIONS RESEARCH LETTERS+FEB 1998::A comparative evaluation of nine well-known algorithms for solving the cell formation problem in group technology+Miltenburg, J.; Zhang, W.+Journal of Operations Management+1991::EFFICIENT ALGORITHM FOR 0-1 KNAPSACK PROBLEM+NAUSS, RM+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+1976::The clique partitioning problem: Facets and patching facets+Oosten, M; Rutten, JHGC; Spieksma, FCR+NETWORKS+DEC 2001::Optimal bivariate clustering and a genetic algorithm with an application in cellular manufacturing+Rogers, DF; Kulkarni, SS+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+JAN 16 2005::Solving group technology problems via clique partitioning+Wang, Haibo; Alidace, Bahram; Glover, Fred; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS+JUN 2006::A pegging approach to the precedence-constrained knapsack problem+You, Byungjun; Yamada, Takeo+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+DEC 1 2007"
Multinomial logit models with implicit variable selection,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0136-4,DEC 2013,21,3,"The multinomial logit model is the most widely used model for the unordered multi-category responses. However, applications are typically restricted to the use of few predictors because in the high-dimensional case maximum likelihood estimates frequently do not exist. In this paper we are developing a boosting technique called multinomBoost that performs variable selection and fits the multinomial logit model also when predictors are high-dimensional. Since in multi-category models the effect of one predictor variable is represented by several parameters one has to distinguish between variable selection and parameter selection. A special feature of the approach is that, in contrast to existing approaches, it selects variables not parameters. The method can also distinguish between mandatory predictors and optional predictors. Moreover, it adapts to metric, binary, nominal and ordinal predictors. Regularization within the algorithm allows to include nominal and ordinal variables which have many categories. In the case of ordinal predictors the order information is used. The performance of boosting technique with respect to mean squared error, prediction error and the identification of relevant variables is investigated in a simulation study. The method is applied to the national Indonesia contraceptive prevalence survey and the identification of glass. Results are also compared with the Lasso approach which selects parameters.","False alarm rate,Hit rate,Likelihood based boosting,Logistic regression,Multinomial logit,Penalization,Side constraints,Variable selection","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,RIDGE-REGRESSION,ALGORITHMS,REGULARIZATION,CLASSIFICATION,PREDICTION,LASSO","Zahid, Faisal Maqbool@Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan::Tutz, Gerhard@Univ Munich, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Zahid, Faisal Maqbool@Government College University Faisalabad::Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich",not exist,"no title+Blake, C; Merz, CJ.+UCI Repository of machine learning databases+1998::Boosting algorithms: Regularization, prediction and model fitting+Buehlmann, Peter; Hothorn, Torsten+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2007::Boosting with the L-2 loss: Regression and classification+Buhlmann, P; Yu, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2003::Boosting for high-dimensional linear models+Buhlmann, Peter+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2006::Experiments with a new boosting algorithm+Freund, Y.; Schapire, R.E.+Machine Learning.

With different DC decompositions, DC optimization formulations for the linear and nonlinear are investigated. The resulting DC optimization algorithms (DCA) only require solving simple linear program or convex quadratic program at each iteration, and converge to a critical point after a finite number of iterations. The effectiveness of proposed algorithms are demonstrated on some UCI databases and licorice seed near-infrared spectroscopy data. Moreover, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms offer competitive performances to the existing methods.","Nonconvex optimization,DC programming,Semi-supervised support vector machine","OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES,CLASSIFICATION,SELECTION","Yang, Liming@China Agr Univ, Coll Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China::Wang, Laisheng@China Agr Univ, Coll Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China","Yang, Liming@China Agricultural University::Wang, Laisheng@China Agricultural University",not exist,"A set-membership state estimation algorithm based on DC programming+Alamo, T.; Bravo, J.

Energy-based function to evaluate data stream clustering,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0145-3,DEC 2013,52,3,"Severe constraints imposed by the nature of endless sequences of data collected from unstable phenomena have pushed the understanding and the development of automated analysis strategies, such as data clustering techniques. However, current clustering validation approaches are inadequate to data streams due to they do not properly evaluate representation of behavior changes. This paper proposes a novel function to continuously evaluate data stream clustering inspired in Lyapunov energy functions used by techniques such as the Hopfield artificial neural network and the Bidirectional Associative Memory (Bam). The proposed function considers three terms: i) the intra-cluster distance, which allows to evaluate cluster compactness; ii) the inter-cluster distance, which reflects cluster separability; and iii) entropy estimation of the clustering model, which permits the evaluation of the level of uncertainty in data streams. A first set of experiments illustrate the proposed function applied to scenarios of continuous evaluation of data stream clustering. Further experiments were conducted to compare this new function to well-established clustering indices and results confirm our proposal reflects the same information obtained with external clustering indices.","Machine learning,Data streams,Data clustering,Evaluation of data clustering,Lyapunov energy function","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGES,ALGORITHMS","Albertini, Marcelo Keese@Univ Fed Uberlandia, Fac Comp, Uberlandia, MG, Brazil::de Mello, Rodrigo Fernandes@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Comp Sci, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Albertini, Marcelo Keese@Universidade Federal de Uberlandia::de Mello, Rodrigo Fernandes@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Inst Cien Matematicas Computacao, ICMC/USP@D-8320-2017::Cepid, CeMEAI@J-2417-2015","A LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR BOLTZMANN MACHINES+ACKLEY, DH; HINTON, GE; SEJNOWSKI, TJ+COGNITIVE SCIENCE+1985::A framework for clustering evolving data streams+Aggarwal, CC; Han, J; Wang, J<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Yu, PS</span>.+P 29 INT C VER LARG+2003::no title+ALBERTINI M+NATURE INSPIRED INFO+2008::A Self-Organizing Neural Network for Detecting Novelties+Albertini, Marcelo Keese; de Mello, Rodrigo Fernandes+APPLIED COMPUTING 2007, VOL 1 AND 2+2007::no title+ALLCOCK B+P ACM IEEE 2001 C SU+2001::no title+Alligood, K.; Sauer, T D.; Yorke, J.

Infinite Dirichlet mixture models learning via expectation propagation,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0152-4,DEC 2013,59,2,"In this article, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm based on a Dirichlet process mixture of Dirichlet distributions which have been shown to be very flexible for modeling proportional data. The idea is to let the number of mixture components increases as new data to cluster arrive in such a manner that the model selection problem (i.e. determination of the number of clusters) can be answered without recourse to classic selection criteria. Thus, the proposed model can be considered as an infinite Dirichlet mixture model. An expectation propagation inference framework is developed to learn this model by obtaining a full posterior distribution on its parameters. Within this learning framework, the model complexity and all the involved parameters are evaluated simultaneously. To show the practical relevance and efficiency of our model, we perform a detailed analysis using extensive simulations based on both synthetic and real data.

Model-based clustering of high-dimensional data streams with online mixture of probabilistic PCA,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0133-7,SEP 2013,42,5,"Model-based clustering is a popular tool which is renowned for its probabilistic foundations and its flexibility. However, model-based clustering techniques usually perform poorly when dealing with high-dimensional data streams, which are nowadays a frequent data type. To overcome this limitation of model-based clustering, we propose an online inference algorithm for the mixture of probabilistic PCA model. The proposed algorithm relies on an EM-based procedure and on a probabilistic and incremental version of PCA. Model selection is also considered in the online setting through parallel computing. Numerical experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and compare it to state-of-the-art online EM-based algorithms.","Model-based clustering,Mixture of probabilistic PCA,Data streams,High-dimensional data,Online inference","CLASSIFICATION EM ALGORITHM,FACTOR ANALYZERS,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,INCOMPLETE DATA,ECM ALGORITHM","Bellas, Anastasios@Univ Paris 01, SAMM EA 4543, F-75634 Paris 13, France::Bouveyron, Charles@Univ Paris 01, SAMM EA 4543, F-75634 Paris 13, France::Cottrell, Marie@Univ Paris 01, SAMM EA 4543, F-75634 Paris 13, France::Lacaille, Jerome@Snecma, Grp Safran, F-77550 Moissy Cramayel, France","Bellas, Anastasios@Unknow::Bouveyron, Charles@Unknow::Cottrell, Marie@Unknow::Lacaille, Jerome@Safran S.A.",not exist,"A framework for projected clustering of high dimensional data streams+Aggarwal, C.

Model-based clustering of probability density functions,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0140-8,SEP 2013,39,6,"Complex data such as those where each statistical unit under study is described not by a single observation (or vector variable), but by a unit-specific sample of several or even many observations, are becoming more and more popular. Reducing these sample data by summary statistics, like the average or the median, implies that most inherent information (about variability, skewness or multi-modality) gets lost. Full information is preserved only if each unit is described by a whole distribution. This new kind of data, a.k.a. ""distribution-valued data"", require the development of adequate statistical methods. This paper presents a method to group a set of probability density functions (pdfs) into homogeneous clusters, provided that the pdfs have to be estimated nonparametrically from the unit-specific data. Since elements belonging to the same cluster are naturally thought of as samples from the same probability model, the idea is to tackle the clustering problem by defining and estimating a proper mixture model on the space of pdfs. The issue of model building is challenging here because of the infinite-dimensionality and the non-Euclidean geometry of the domain space. By adopting a wavelet-based representation for the elements in the space, the task is accomplished by using mixture models for hyper-spherical data. The proposed solution is illustrated through a simulation experiment and on two real data sets.","Mixture models,Wavelet density estimation,Hyper-spherical data,Von Mises-Fisher distribution","DISTRIBUTIONS,SINGLE","Montanari, Angela@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy::Calo, Daniela G.@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Montanari, Angela@University of Bologna::Calo, Daniela G.@University of Bologna","Montanari, Angela@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8369-1761","no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.

Dimension reduction for model-based clustering via mixtures of multivariate t-distributions,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0137-3,SEP 2013,47,9,"We introduce a dimension reduction method for model-based clustering obtained from a finite mixture of -distributions. This approach is based on existing work on reducing dimensionality in the case of finite Gaussian mixtures. The method relies on identifying a reduced subspace of the data by considering the extent to which group means and group covariances vary. This subspace contains linear combinations of the original data, which are ordered by importance via the associated eigenvalues. Observations can be projected onto the subspace and the resulting set of variables captures most of the clustering structure available in the data. The approach is illustrated using simulated and real data, where it outperforms its Gaussian analogue.","Dimension reduction,Mixture models,Model-based clustering","FACTOR ANALYZERS,GENE-EXPRESSION,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,VARIABLE SELECTION,EM ALGORITHM,CLASSIFICATION,FRAMEWORK","Morris, Katherine@Univ Guelph, Dept Math & Stat, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada::McNicholas, Paul D.@Univ Guelph, Dept Math & Stat, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada::Scrucca, Luca@Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Econ Finanza & Stat, I-06100 Perugia, Italy","Morris, Katherine@University of Guelph::McNicholas, Paul D.@University of Guelph::Scrucca, Luca@University of Perugia",not exist,"no title+Andrews, J.L.; McNicholas, P.D.+teigen: Model-based clustering and classification with the multivariate t-distribution.

Clustering student skill set profiles in a unit hypercube using mixtures of multivariate betas,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0149-z,SEP 2013,33,3,"This paper presents a finite mixture of multivariate betas as a new model-based clustering method tailored to applications where the feature space is constrained to the unit hypercube. The mixture component densities are taken to be conditionally independent, univariate unimodal beta densities (from the subclass of reparameterized beta densities given by Bagnato and Punzo in Comput Stat 28(4):<ExternalRef> <RefSource>10.1007/s00180-012-367-4</RefSource> <RefTarget Address=""10.1007/s00180-012-367-4"" TargetType=""DOI""/> </ExternalRef>, 2013). The EM algorithm used to fit this mixture is discussed in detail, and results from both this beta mixture model and the more standard Gaussian model-based clustering are presented for simulated skill mastery data from a common cognitive diagnosis model and for real data from the Assistment System online mathematics tutor (Feng et al. in J User Model User Adap Inter 19(3):243-266, 2009). The multivariate beta mixture appears to outperform the standard Gaussian model-based clustering approach, as would be expected on the constrained space. Fewer components are selected (by BIC-ICL) in the beta mixture than in the Gaussian mixture, and the resulting clusters seem more reasonable and interpretable.","Mixture model clustering,Multivariate beta densities,Skill set profiles,Unit hypercube","VARIABLE SELECTION,MODEL","Dean, Nema@Univ Glasgow, Sch Math & Stat, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland::Nugent, Rebecca@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Dean, Nema@University of Glasgow::Nugent, Rebecca@Carnegie Mellon University",not exist,"no title+AYERS E+P INT C ED DAT MIN C+2009::Skill set profile clustering based on student capability vectors computed from online tutoring data+Ayers, E.; Nugent, R.; Dean, N.+P 1 INT C ED DAT MIN+2008::Finite mixtures of unimodal beta and gamma densities and the k-bumps algorithm+Bagnato, L; Punzo, A.+Computational Statistics+2013::The Q-matrix method: mining student response data for knowledge+Barnes, TM.+ED DATA MINING+2005::Combining Mixture Components for Clustering+Baudry, Jean-Patrick; Raftery, Adrian E.; Celeux, Gilles; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2010::Mixturemodel component trees: Visualizing the hierarchical structure of complex groups+Dean, N; Nugent, R.+Tech. rep.+2013::Comparing different clustering models on the unit hypercube+Dean, N; Nugent, R.+P 58 WORLD STAT C+2011::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::DINA model and parameter estimation: A didactic+desla Torre, J.+Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics+2009::Review of Cognitively Diagnostic Assessment and a Summary of Psychometric Models+DiBello, Louis V.; Roussos, Louis A.; Stout, William+PSYCHOMETRICS+2007::Addressing the assessment challenge with an online system that tutors as it assesses+Feng, Mingyu; Heffernan, Neil; Koedinger, Kenneth+USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION+AUG 2009::How many clusters?

On mixtures of skew normal and skew t-distributions,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0132-8,SEP 2013,43,62,"Finite mixtures of skew distributions have emerged as an effective tool in modelling heterogeneous data with asymmetric features. With various proposals appearing rapidly in the recent years, which are similar but not identical, the connection between them and their relative performance becomes rather unclear. This paper aims to provide a concise overview of these developments by presenting a systematic classification of the existing skew symmetric distributions into four types, thereby clarifying their close relationships. This also aids in understanding the link between some of the proposed expectation-maximization based algorithms for the computation of the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the models. The final part of this paper presents an illustration of the performance of these mixture models in clustering a real dataset, relative to other non-elliptically contoured clustering methods and associated algorithms for their implementation.","Skew symmetric distributions,Multivariate skew normal,Multivariate skew t-distribution,Mixture models,Maximum likelihood estimation,EMalgorithm","ELLIPTIC DISTRIBUTIONS,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,MODELS","Lee, Sharon X.@Univ Queensland, Dept Math, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia::McLachlan, Geoffrey J.@Univ Queensland, Dept Math, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Lee, Sharon X.@University of Queensland::McLachlan, Geoffrey J.@University of Queensland","McLachlan, Geoffrey@A-1491-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5921-3145","On fundamental skew distributions+Arellano-Valle, RB; Genton, MG+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+SEP 2005::Multivariate extended skew-t distributions and related families+Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo; Genton, Marc+METRON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2010::Bayesian Inference for Shape Mixtures of Skewed Distributions, with Application to Regression Analysis+Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.; Castro, Luis M.; Genton, Marc G.; et al.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2008::A unified view on skewed distributions arising from selections+Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.; Branco, Marcia D.; Genton, Marc G.+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 2006::On the unification of families of skew-normal distributions+Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.; Azzalini, Adelchi+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2006::THE NONTRUNCATED MARGINAL OF A TRUNCATED BIVARIATE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION+ARNOLD, BC; BEAVER, RJ; GROENEVELD, RA; et al.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1993::The multivariate skew-normal distribution+Azzalini, A; DallaValle, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::Distributions generated by perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on a multivariate skew t-distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::Multivariate mixture modeling using skew-normal independent distributions+Barbosa Cabral, Celso Romulo; Lachos, Victor Hugo; Prates, Marcos O.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 1 2012::Robust mixture modeling based on scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions+Basso, Rodrigo M.; Lachos, Victor H.; Barbosa Cabral, Celso Romulo; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 1 2010::A general class of multivariate skew-elliptical distributions+Branco, MD; Dey, DK+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 2001::Growth curve based on scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions to model the age-length relationship of cardinalfish (epigonus crassicaudus)+Contreras-Reyes, JE; Arellano-Valle, RB.+arXiv:12125180 [statAP]+2012::Mixtures of shifted asymmetric laplace distributions+Franczak, BC; Browne, RP; McNicholas, PD.+arXiv:12071727 [statME]+2012::Bayesian inference for finite mixtures of univariate and multivariate skew-normal and skew-t distributions+Fruehwirth-Schnatter, Sylvia; Pyne, Saumyadipta+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2010::no title+Genton, M.

A Monte Carlo evaluation of three methods to detect local dependence in binary data latent class models,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0146-2,SEP 2013,41,13,"Binary data latent class analysis is a form of model-based clustering applied in a wide range of fields. A central assumption of this model is that of conditional independence of responses given latent class membership, often referred to as the ""local independence"" assumption. The results of latent class analysis may be severely biased when this crucial assumption is violated; investigating the degree to which bivariate relationships between observed variables fit this hypothesis therefore provides vital information. This article evaluates three methods of doing so. The first is the commonly applied method of referring the so-called ""bivariate residuals"" to a Chi-square distribution. We also introduce two alternative methods that are novel to the investigation of local dependence in latent class analysis: bootstrapping the bivariate residuals, and the asymptotic score test or ""modification index"". Our Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the latter two methods perform adequately, while the first method does not perform as intended.","Conditional dependence,Latent variable models,Score test,Lagrange multiplier test,Modification index,Bivariate residuals","DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS,GOLD-STANDARD,PREVALENCE,ACCURACY,ERROR,ACID","Oberski, Daniel L.@Tilburg Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands::van Kollenburg, Geert H.@Tilburg Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands::Vermunt, Jeroen K.@Tilburg Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","Oberski, Daniel L.@Tilburg University::van Kollenburg, Geert H.@Tilburg University::Vermunt, Jeroen K.@Tilburg University","Oberski, Daniel@F-8421-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7467-2297::vermunt, jeroen@K-3680-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9053-9330","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::A cautionary note on the robustness of latent class models for estimating diagnostic error without a gold standard+Albert, PS; Dodd, LE+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2004::Utility of composite reference standards and latent class analysis in evaluating the clinical accuracy of diagnostic tests for pertussis+Baughman, Andrew L.; Bisgard, Kristine M.; Cortese, Margaret M.; et al.+CLINICAL AND VACCINE IMMUNOLOGY+JAN 2008::Assessing Performance of Orthology Detection Strategies Applied to Eukaryotic Genomes+Chen, Feng; Mackey, Aaron J.; Vermunt, Jeroen K.; et al.+PLOS ONE+APR 18 2007::no title+Collins, L.

Interpretable clustering using unsupervised binary trees,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0129-3,JUN 2013,25,6,"We herein introduce a new method of interpretable clustering that uses unsupervised binary trees. It is a three-stage procedure, the first stage of which entails a series of recursive binary splits to reduce the heterogeneity of the data within the new subsamples. During the second stage (pruning), consideration is given to whether adjacent nodes can be aggregated. Finally, during the third stage (joining), similar clusters are joined together, even if they do not share the same parent originally. Consistency results are obtained, and the procedure is used on simulated and real data sets.","Unsupervised classification,CART,Pattern recognition",,"Fraiman, Ricardo@Univ San Andres, RA-1644 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina@Univ Republ, RA-1644 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina::Ghattas, Badih@Univ Aix Marseille 2, Dept Math, Fac Sci Luminy, F-13288 Marseille 09, France::Svarc, Marcela@Univ San Andres & Conicet, RA-1644 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Fraiman, Ricardo@Unknow::Ghattas, Badih@Aix-Marseille Universite::Svarc, Marcela@Unknow","Svarc, Marcela@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5041-8304","Hierarchical density-based clustering of categorical data and a simplification+Andreopoulos, Bill; An, Aijun; Wang, Xiaogang+ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, PROCEEDINGS+2007::A review of robust clustering methods+Angel Garcia-Escudero, Luis; Gordaliza, Alfonso; Matran, Carlos; et al.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2010::Interpretable hierarchical clustering by constructing an unsupervised decision tree+Basak, J; Krishnapuram, R+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING+JAN 2005::no title+BLOCKEEL H+P 15 INT C MACH LEAR+1998::no title+Breiman, L; Friedman, J; Stone, CJ<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Olshen, RA</span>.+Classification and regression trees+1984::no title+CHAVENT M+REV STAT APPL+1999::A Density -based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters a Density -based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise+Ester, M.; Kriegel, H. -P.; Sander, J.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Xu, X</span>.+P 2 INT C KNOWL DISC+1996::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::Clustering data: theory, algorithms and applications+Gan, G; Ma, C; Wu, J.+CLUSTERING DATA THEO+2007::no title+Gini, C.+Variability and mutability+1912::no title+Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R.+The elements of statistical learning, corrected+2003::COMPARING PARTITIONS+HUBERT, L; ARABIE, P+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1985::PROBABILISTIC DISTANCE CLUSTERING ADJUSTED FOR CLUSTER SIZE+Iyigun, Cem; Ben-Israel, Adi+PROBABILITY IN THE ENGINEERING AND INFORMATIONAL SCIENCES+2008::Clustering through decision tree construction+Liu, B.; Xia, Y.; Yu, P.

Fuzzy spectral clustering by PCCA plus : application to Markov state models and data classification,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0134-6,JUN 2013,50,37,"Given a row-stochastic matrix describing pairwise similarities between data objects, spectral clustering makes use of the eigenvectors of this matrix to perform dimensionality reduction for clustering in fewer dimensions. One example from this class of algorithms is the Robust Perron Cluster Analysis (PCCA+), which delivers a fuzzy clustering. Originally developed for clustering the state space of Markov chains, the method became popular as a versatile tool for general data classification problems. The robustness of PCCA+, however, cannot be explained by previous perturbation results, because the matrices in typical applications do not comply with the two main requirements: reversibility and nearly decomposability. We therefore demonstrate in this paper that PCCA+ always delivers an optimal fuzzy clustering for nearly uncoupled, not necessarily reversible, Markov chains with transition states.","Perron eigenvalues,Perturbation theory,Molecular simulations","DIFFUSION MAPS,IDENTIFICATION,APPROXIMATION,SEGMENTATION,ALGORITHM,ITERATION,SYSTEMS,CHAINS","Roeblitz, Susanna@Zuse Inst Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany::Weber, Marcus@Zuse Inst Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Roeblitz, Susanna@Unknow::Weber, Marcus@Unknow","Roblitz, Susanna@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2735-0030","no title+Bapat, R.B.; Raghavan, T.E.S.+Nonnegative Matrices and Applications+1997::Laplacian eigenmaps for dimensionality reduction and data representation+Belkin, M; Niyogi, P+NEURAL COMPUTATION+JUN 2003::FCM - THE FUZZY C-MEANS CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM+BEZDEK, JC; EHRLICH, R; FULL, W+COMPUTERS &amp; GEOSCIENCES+1984::Coarse-grained Markov chains capture molecular thermodynamics and kinetics in no uncertain terms+Bowman, GR.+COARSE GRAINED MARKO+2012::Progress and challenges in the automated construction of Markov state models for full protein systems+Bowman, Gregory R.; Beauchamp, Kyle A.; Boxer, George; et al.+JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS+SEP 28 2009::Markov Chains, Gibbs Fields, Monte Carlo Simulation and Queues+Bremaud, P.+Texts in Applied Mathematics+1999::Automatic discovery of metastable states for the construction of Markov models of macromolecular conformational dynamics+Chodera, JD; Singhal, N; Swope, WC<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Pande, VS; Dill, KA</span>.+J Chem Phys+2007::Diffusion maps+Coifman, Ronald R.; Lafon, Stephane+APPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL HARMONIC ANALYSIS+JUL 2006::no title+COURTOIS PJ+DECOMPOSABILITY QUEU+1977::On the approximation of complicated dynamical behavior+Dellnitz, M; Junge, O+SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS+MAR 5 1999::Robust Perron cluster analysis in conformation dynamics+Deuflhard, P; Weber, M+LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS+MAR 15 2005::Identification of almost invariant aggregates in reversible nearly uncoupled Markov chains+Deuflhard, P; Huisinga, W; Fischer, A; et al.+LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS+AUG 15 2000::From molecular dynamics to conformation dynamics in drug design+Deuflhard, P+TRENDS IN NONLINEAR ANALYSIS+2003::A meshless discretization method for Markov state models applied to explicit water peptide folding simulations+Bujotzek, A; Weber, M.+LECT NOTES COMPUTATI+2013::Path based pairwise data clustering with application to texture segmentation+Fischer, B; Zoller, T; Buhmann, JM+ENERGY MINIMIZATION METHODS IN COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION+2001::Data resampling for path based clustering+Fischer, B; Buhmann, JM.+LECT NOTES COMPUTER+2002::Amplifying the block matrix structure for spectral clustering+Fischer, I.; Poland, J.+Idsia+January 2005::no title+Frenkel, D.; Smit, B.+Understanding molecular simulation: from algorithms to applications+2002::Merck molecular force field .4.

A clustering ensemble framework based on elite selection of weighted clusters,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0130-x,JUN 2013,29,6,"Each clustering algorithm usually optimizes a qualification metric during its progress. The qualification metric in conventional clustering algorithms considers all the features equally important; in other words each feature participates in the clustering process equivalently. It is obvious that some features have more information than others in a dataset. So it is highly likely that some features should have lower importance degrees during a clustering or a classification algorithm; due to their lower information or their higher variances and etc. So it is always a desire for all artificial intelligence communities to enforce the weighting mechanism in any task that identically uses a number of features to make a decision. But there is always a certain problem of how the features can be participated in the clustering process (in any algorithm, but especially in clustering algorithm) in a weighted manner. Recently, this problem is dealt with by locally adaptive clustering (LAC). However, like its traditional competitors the LAC suffers from inefficiency in data with imbalanced clusters. This paper solves the problem by proposing a weighted locally adaptive clustering (WLAC) algorithm that is based on the LAC algorithm. However, WLAC algorithm suffers from sensitivity to its two parameters that should be tuned manually. The performance of WLAC algorithm is affected by well-tuning of its parameters. Paper proposes two solutions. The first is based on a simple clustering ensemble framework to examine the sensitivity of the WLAC algorithm to its manual well-tuning. The second is based on cluster selection method.","Clustering ensemble,Subspace clustering,Weighted clusters,Features weighting","EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION,VALIDATION,CRITERION","Parvin, Hamid@IUST, Sch Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran::Minaei-Bidgoli, Behrouz@IUST, Sch Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran","Parvin, Hamid@Iran University Science & Technology::Minaei-Bidgoli, Behrouz@Iran University Science & Technology",not exist,"Automatic subspace clustering of high dimensional data+Agrawal, R.; Gehrke, J.; Gunopulos, D.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Raghavan, P</span>.+P ACM SIGMOD INT C M+1998::A New Criterion for Clusters Validation+Alizadeh, Hosein; Minaei, Behrouz; Parvin, Hamid+ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS AND INNOVATIONS, PT II+2011::An Asymmetric Criterion for Cluster Validation+Alizadeh, Hosein; Minaei, Behrouz; Parvin, Hamid; et al.+DEVELOPING CONCEPTS IN APPLIED INTELLIGENCE+2011::TRAINING A 3-NODE NEURAL NETWORK IS NP-COMPLETE+BLUM, AL; RIVEST, RL+NEURAL NETWORKS+1992::A new cell- based clustering method for large, high- dimensional data in data mining applications+Chang, J. - W.; Jin, D. - S.+P 2002 ACM S APPL CO+2002::Entropy-based subspace clustering for mining numerical data+Cheng, C- H; Fu, AW; Zhang, Y.+P 5 ACM SIGKDD INT C+1999::Weighted cluster ensembles: methods and analysis+Domeniconi, C.; Al-razgan, M.+ACM Trans.

The principle of probabilistic measure invariance, applied under the assumption that the model be isotonic, leads to a system of differential equations. Such differential system is reformulated in terms of an integral equation that affords an iterative numerical solution.

Clustering and classification via cluster-weighted factor analyzers,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0124-8,MAR 2013,62,21,"In model-based clustering and classification, the cluster-weighted model is a convenient approach when the random vector of interest is constituted by a response variable and by a vector of covariates. However, its applicability may be limited when is high. To overcome this problem, this paper assumes a latent factor structure for in each mixture component, under Gaussian assumptions. This leads to the cluster-weighted factor analyzers (CWFA) model. By imposing constraints on the variance of and the covariance matrix of , a novel family of sixteen CWFA models is introduced for model-based clustering and classification. The alternating expectation-conditional maximization algorithm, for maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of all models in the family, is described; to initialize the algorithm, a 5-step hierarchical procedure is proposed, which uses the nested structures of the models within the family and thus guarantees the natural ranking among the sixteen likelihoods. Artificial and real data show that these models have very good clustering and classification performance and that the algorithm is able to recover the parameters very well.","Cluster-weighted models,Factor analysis,Mixture models,Parsimonious models","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,LINEAR-REGRESSION,MIXTURE ANALYSIS,EM ALGORITHM,MODEL,DISTRIBUTIONS,PARAMETERS","Subedi, Sanjeena@Univ Guelph, Dept Math & Stat, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada::Punzo, Antonio@Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, I-95129 Catania, Italy::Ingrassia, Salvatore@Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, I-95129 Catania, Italy::McNicholas, Paul D.@Univ Guelph, Dept Math & Stat, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Subedi, Sanjeena@University of Guelph::Punzo, Antonio@University of Catania::Ingrassia, Salvatore@University of Catania::McNicholas, Paul D.@University of Guelph",not exist,"Age variation in voles (Microtus californicus, M. ochrogaster) and its significance for systematic studies+Airoldi, J.; Hoffmann, R.+Occasional Papers of theMuseum of Natural History+1984::no title+Aitken, A.+Proc.

Regularized logistic discrimination with basis expansions for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease based on three-dimensional MRI data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0127-5,MAR 2013,17,2,"In recent years, evidence has emerged indicating that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans provide valuable diagnostic information about Alzheimer's disease. It has been shown that MRI brain scans are capable of both diagnosing Alzheimer's disease itself at an early stage and identifying people at risk of developing Alzheimer's. In this article, we have investigated statistical methods for classifying Alzheimer's disease patients based on three-dimensional MRI data via L2-type regularized logistic discrimination with basis expansions. Preceding studies adopted an open approach when applying three-dimensional data analysis. Our proposed classification model with dimension reduction techniques offers discriminant functions with excellent prediction performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity.","Regularized logistic discrimination,Three-dimensional MRI data,Alzheimer's disease,Dimension reduction,Tuning parameter selection","VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,GRAY-MATTER LOSS,SPLINE FUNCTIONS","Araki, Yuko@Kurume Univ, Biostat Ctr, Kurume, Fukuoka 8300011, Japan::Kawaguchi, Atsushi@Kurume Univ, Biostat Ctr, Kurume, Fukuoka 8300011, Japan::Yamashita, Fumio@Iwate Med Univ, Div Ultrahigh Field MRI, Inst Biomed Sci, Morioka, Iwate 0208505, Japan","Araki, Yuko@Kurume University::Kawaguchi, Atsushi@Kurume University::Yamashita, Fumio@Iwate Medical University",not exist,"Unified segmentation+Ashburner, J; Friston, KJ+NEUROIMAGE+JUL 1 2005::In vivo mapping of gray matter loss with voxel-based morphometry in mild Alzheimer's disease+Baron, JC; Chetelat, G; Desgranges, B; et al.+NEUROIMAGE+AUG 2001::Evaluating the Impact of Different Factors on Voxel-Based Classification Methods of ADNI Structural MRI Brain Images+Casanova, R; Maldjian, JA; Espeland, MA.+Int J Biomed Data Min+2011::High dimensional classification of structural MRI Alzheimer's disease data based on large scale regularization.+Casanova, Ramon; Whitlow, Christopher T; Wagner, Benjamin; et al.+Frontiers in neuroinformatics+2011::SMOOTHING NOISY DATA WITH SPLINE FUNCTIONS - ESTIMATING THE CORRECT DEGREE OF SMOOTHING BY THE METHOD OF GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION+CRAVEN, P; WAHBA, G+NUMERISCHE MATHEMATIK+1979::Automatic classification of patients with Alzheimer's disease from structural MRI: A comparison of ten methods using the ADNI database+Cuingnet, Remi; Gerardin, Emilie; Tessieras, Jerome; et al.+NEUROIMAGE+MAY 15 2011::no title+Green, PJ; Silverman, BW.+Nonparametric regression and generalized linear models: a roughness penalty approach+1994::Voxel-based morphometry to discriminate early Alzheimer's disease from controls+Hirata, Y; Matsuda, H; Nemoto, K; et al.+NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS+JUL 15 2005::A comprehensive study of gray matter loss in patients with Alzheimer's disease using optimized voxel-based morphometry+Karas, GB; Burton, EJ; Rombouts, SARB; et al.+NEUROIMAGE+APR 2003::Automatic classification of MR scans in Alzheimers disease+Kloeppel, Stefan; Stonnington, Cynthia M.; Chu, Carlton; et al.+BRAIN+MAR 2008::THE CLINICAL DEMENTIA RATING (CDR) - CURRENT VERSION AND SCORING RULES+MORRIS, JC+NEUROLOGY+NOV 1993::Functional Generalized Linear Models with Images as Predictors+Reiss, Philip T.; Ogden, R.

Cohen's weighted kappa with additive weights,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0123-9,MAR 2013,27,7,"Cohen's weighted kappa is a popular descriptive statistic for summarizing interrater agreement on an ordinal scale. An agreement table with ordered categories can be collapsed into distinct tables by combining adjacent categories. Weighted kappa with linear weights is a weighted average of the kappas corresponding to the tables, where the weights are the denominators of the kappas. It is shown that the linearly weighted kappa is a special case of a more general weighted kappa that is a weighted average of the kappas. This weighted kappa has additive weights, that is, given initial weights for pairs of adjacent categories the weight for two non-adjacent categories is obtained by adding the weights of all pairs of adjacent categories between the two.","Cohen's kappa,Combining categories,Linear weights,Quadratic weights,2 x 2 Tables,Glasgow outcome scale","NOMINAL SCALE AGREEMENT,GLASGOW OUTCOME SCALE,OBSERVER AGREEMENT,MULTIPLE RATERS,RELIABILITY,COEFFICIENT","Warrens, Matthijs J.@Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, Unit Methodol & Stat, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands","Warrens, Matthijs J.@Leiden University",not exist,"Glasgow outcome scale: An inter-rater reliability study+Anderson, Shirley I.; Housley, Alma M.; Jones, Patricia A.; et al.+Brain Injury+1993::WEIGHTED KAPPA FOR MULTIPLE RATERS+Berry, Kenneth J.; Johnston, Janis E.; Mielke, Paul W., Jr.+PERCEPTUAL AND MOTOR SKILLS+DEC 2008::Dependence of weighted kappa coefficients on the number of categories+Brenner, H; Kliebsch, U+EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAR 1996::A new procedure for assessing reliability of scoring EEG sleep recordings+Cicchetti, D.V.; Allison, T.+American Journal of EEG Technology+Sept. 1971::ASSESSING INTER-RATER RELIABILITY FOR RATING-SCALES - RESOLVING SOME BASIC ISSUES+CICCHETTI, DV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY+1976::A COEFFICIENT OF AGREEMENT FOR NOMINAL SCALES+COHEN, J+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+1960::WEIGHTED KAPPA - NOMINAL SCALE AGREEMENT WITH PROVISION FOR SCALED DISAGREEMENT OR PARTIAL CREDIT+COHEN, J+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1968::EQUIVALENCE OF WEIGHTED KAPPA AND INTRACLASS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AS MEASURES OF RELIABILITY+FLEISS, JL; COHEN, J+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+1973::LARGE SAMPLE STANDARD ERRORS OF KAPPA AND WEIGHTED KAPPA+FLEISS, JL; COHEN, J; EVERITT, BS+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1969::THE ANALYSIS OF ORDINAL AGREEMENT DATA - BEYOND WEIGHTED KAPPA+GRAHAM, P; JACKSON, R+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+SEP 1993::Interrater agreement measures: comments on kappa n, Cohen's kappa, Scott's &amp;pi;, and Aickin's &amp;alpha+Hsu, L.

Functional fuzzy clusterwise regression analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-013-0126-6,MAR 2013,40,2,"We propose a functional extension of fuzzy clusterwise regression, which estimates fuzzy memberships of clusters and regression coefficient functions for each cluster simultaneously. The proposed method permits dependent and/or predictor variables to be functional, varying over time, space, and other continua. The fuzzy memberships and clusterwise regression coefficient functions are estimated by minimizing an objective function that adopts a basis function expansion approach to approximating functional data. An alternating least squares algorithm is developed to minimize the objective function. We conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to its non-functional counterpart and to examine the performance of various cluster validity measures for selecting the optimal number of clusters. We apply the proposed method to real datasets to illustrate the empirical usefulness of the proposed method.","Functional linear models,Fuzzy clusterwise regression model,Alternating least squares algorithm","LINEAR-REGRESSION,RIDGE-REGRESSION,VALIDITY,ALGORITHMS,FUZZINESS,MODELS,INDEX","Tan, Tianyu@McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada::Suk, Hye Won@McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada::Hwang, Heungsun@McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada::Lim, Jooseop@Concordia Univ, Dept Mkt, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Tan, Tianyu@McGill University::Suk, Hye Won@McGill University::Hwang, Heungsun@McGill University::Lim, Jooseop@Concordia University - Canada",not exist,"Modelling intra-daily volatility by functional data analysis: an empirical application to the Spanish stock market+Alva, K; Romo, J; Ruiz, E.+Statistics and Econometrics Series+2009::Cluster validity with fuzzy sets+Bezdek, J.C.+Journal of Cybernetics+July-Sept. 1973::no title+Bezdek, J.

Image data analysis and classification in marketing,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0116-0,DEC 2012,82,5,"Nowadays, the diffusion of smartphones, tablet computers, and other multipurpose equipment with high-speed Internet access makes new data types available for data analysis and classification in marketing. So, e.g., it is now possible to collect images/snaps, music, or videos instead of ratings. With appropriate algorithms and software at hand, a marketing researcher could simply group or classify respondents according to the content of uploaded images/snaps, music, or videos. However, appropriate algorithms and software are sparsely known in marketing research up to now. The paper tries to close this gap. Algorithms and software from computer science are presented, adapted and applied to data analysis and classification in marketing. The new SPSS-like software package IMADAC is introduced.","Image data analysis,Image classification,Market segmentation","EARTH-MOVERS-DISTANCE,CLUSTER-ANALYSIS,PATTERN-RECOGNITION,TEXTURAL FEATURES,SEGMENTATION,RETRIEVAL,MODELS,LEVEL","Baier, Daniel@Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Chair Mkt & Innovat Management, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany::Daniel, Ines@Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Chair Mkt & Innovat Management, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany::Frost, Sarah@Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Chair Mkt & Innovat Management, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany::Naundorf, Robert@Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Chair Mkt & Innovat Management, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany","Baier, Daniel@Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus::Daniel, Ines@Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus::Frost, Sarah@Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus::Naundorf, Robert@Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus",not exist,"SAS, Stata, SPSS: A comparison.+Acock, AC+JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY+NOV 2005::Jahresbericht 2010+no author+Arbeitskreis deutscher Markt- und Sozialforschungsinstitute (ADM) e.V.

Non parametric statistical models for on-line text classification,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0122-2,DEC 2012,25,2,"Social media, such as blogs and on-line forums, contain a huge amount of information that is typically unorganized and fragmented. An important issue, that has been raising importance so far, is to classify on-line texts in order to detect possible anomalies. For example on-line texts representing consumer opinions can be, not only very precious and profitable for companies, but can also represent a serious damage if they are negative or faked. In this contribution we present a novel statistical methodology rooted in the context of classical text classification, in order to address such issues. In the literature, several classifiers have been proposed, among them support vector machine and naive Bayes classifiers. These approaches are not effective when coping with the problem of classifying texts belonging to an unknown author. To this aim, we propose to employ a new method, based on the combination of classification trees with non parametric approaches, such as Kruskal-Wallis and Brunner-Dette-Munk test. The main application of what we propose is the capability to classify an author as a new one, that is potentially trustable, or as an old one, that is potentially faked.","Non parametric statistical models,Kruskal-Wallis test,Brunner-Dette-Munk test,Text analysis,Opinion spam detection",,"Cerchiello, Paola@Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy::Giudici, Paolo@Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Cerchiello, Paola@University of Pavia::Giudici, Paolo@University of Pavia","Giudici, Paolo Stefano@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4198-0127","ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR OF SOME RANK TESTS FOR ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE+ANDREWS, FC+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1954::Distributional clustering of words for text classification+Baker, L.D.; McCallum, A.K.+Proceedings of the 21st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval+1998::no title+Benzecri, JP.+L'Analyse des Donnees+1973::Optimum simultaneous discretization with data grid models in supervised classification: a Bayesian model selection approach+Boulle, Marc+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+JUN 2009::no title+Breiman, L; Friedman, J; Stone, CJ<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Olshen, RA</span>.+Classification and regression trees+1984::Box-type approximations in nonparametric factorial designs+Brunner, E; Dette, H; Munk, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::Statistical models to measure corporate reputation+Cerchiello, P.+J Appl Quant Meth+2011::no title+Conover, W.J.+Practical Nonparametric Statistics+1971::no title+DAGAN I+P 2 C EMP METH NAT L+1997::An extensive empirical study of feature selection metrics for text classification+Forman, G.+Journal of Machine Learning Research+1 Oct.-15 Nov. 2003::Generalized mixture models, semi-supervised learning, and unknown class inference+Frame, Samuel J.; Jammalamadaka, Sreenivasa Rao+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+MAR 2007::no title+Greenacre, MJ.+Correspondence Analysis in Practice+2007::An introduction to variable and feature selection+Guyon, I.; Elisseeff, A.+Journal of Machine Learning Research+1 Oct.-15 Nov. 2003::Finding unusual review patterns using unexpected rules+Jindal, N; Liu, B; Lim, EP.+P ACM 10 CAN+2010::Opinion spam and analysis+Jindal, N; Liu, B.+P WSDM 08 US+2008::no title+JOACHIMS T+P 10 EUR C MACH LEAR+1998::no title+Johnson, N.

Banking customer satisfaction evaluation: a three-way factor perspective,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0118-y,DEC 2012,29,3,"As management of a national bank wanted to analyze its retail service competition loss probably due to low customer satisfaction, we carried out an empirical study based on a sample of 27,000 retail customers. The survey aimed to analyze retail service weaknesses and to individuate possible recovery actions measuring their effectiveness across different waves (three time lags). We studied a definition of a new dissimilarity measure exploiting a dimension reduction obtained by a three-way factor analysis (TFA). We had previously focused our attention on the limits of this approach related to the geometrical properties of the TFA applied. We introduced a reassessment of the points to adjust the three-way solution according to the quality of representation of the points. This transformation only rescaled the factor scores producing a local adjustment of the point configuration. We then performed a trajectory analysis of the different waves. The results showed the effectiveness of our approach. Therefore, further study of the derivation of a synthetic measure of cluster routes seems appropriate.","Dynamic principal component,Customer satisfaction,Three-way factor analysis,Trajectories analysis,Banking sector","LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS,SCALE","Liberati, Caterina@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, I-20126 Milan, Italy::Mariani, Paolo@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Liberati, Caterina@University of Milano-Bicocca::Mariani, Paolo@University of Milano-Bicocca","Liberati, Caterina@B-9208-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9910-4018","no title+no author+Dimensione Cliente 2009+2009::Customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction in retail banking: Exploring the asymmetric impact of attribute performances+Arbore, Alessandro; Busacca, Bruno+JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES+JUL 2009::A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF SERVICE CHANGES ON CUSTOMER ATTITUDES+BOLTON, RN; DREW, JH+JOURNAL OF MARKETING+JAN 1991::Factor analysis of evolution and cluster methods on trajectories+Carlier, A.+COMPSTAT86+1986::A longitudinal analysis of customer satisfaction and share of wallet: Investigating the moderating effect of customer characteristics+Cooil, Bruce; Keiningham, Timothy L.; Aksoy, Lerzan; et al.+JOURNAL OF MARKETING+JAN 2007::Dissimilarities between trajectories of a three-way longitudinal data set+D'Urso, P; Vichi, M.+Advances in data science and classification+1998::Dissimilarity measures for time trajectories+no author+J Ital Stat Soc+2000::The geometric approach to the comparison of multivariate time trajectories+D'Urso, P.; Coppi, R.+ADV DATA SCI CLASSIF+2001::MULTIPLE FACTOR-ANALYSIS (AFMULT PACKAGE)+ESCOFIER, B; PAGES, J+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 1994::Comparaison de groupes des variables definiers sue lememe ensenble d'individus+Escofier, B; Pages, J.+Tech.

Predicting partial customer churn using Markov for discrimination for modeling first purchase sequences,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0121-3,DEC 2012,52,9,"Currently, in order to remain competitive companies are adopting customer centered strategies and consequently customer relationship management is gaining increasing importance. In this context, customer retention deserves particular attention. This paper proposes a model for partial churn detection in the retail grocery sector that includes as a predictor the similarity of the products' first purchase sequence with churner and non-churner sequences. The sequence of first purchase events is modeled using Markov for discrimination. Two classification techniques are used in the empirical study: logistic regression and random forests. A real sample of approximately 95,000 new customers is analyzed taken from the data warehouse of a European retailing company. The empirical results reveal the relevance of the inclusion of a products' sequence likelihood in partial churn prediction models, as well as the supremacy of logistic regression when compared with random forests.","Customer relationship management,Churn analysis,Retailing,Classification,Logistic regression,Random forests","INFORMATIONAL CASCADES,SEQUENTIAL INFORMATION,FINANCIAL SERVICES,SURVIVAL ANALYSIS,CLASSIFICATION,SEGMENTATION,MANAGEMENT,SELECTION,QUALITY,CHOICE","Migueis, Vera L.@Univ Porto, Fac Engn, P-4200465 Oporto, Portugal::Van den Poel, Dirk@Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium::Camanho, Ana S.@Univ Porto, Fac Engn, P-4200465 Oporto, Portugal::Falcao e Cunha, Joao@Univ Porto, Fac Engn, P-4200465 Oporto, Portugal","Migueis, Vera L.@Universidade do Porto::Van den Poel, Dirk@Ghent University::Camanho, Ana S.@Universidade do Porto::Falcao e Cunha, Joao@Universidade do Porto","Migueis, Vera@O-9539-2017::Migueis, Vera@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7831-9140::Van den Poel, Dirk@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8676-8103::Falcao e Cunha, Joao@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2514-3238::Camanho, Ana@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7683-5889","no title+Agresti, A.+An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis+1996::Trust, ethics and relationship satisfaction+Bejou, D.; Ennew, C.

Analyzing consumers' shopping behavior using RFID data and pattern mining,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0117-z,DEC 2012,14,7,"The development of sensor networks has enabled detailed tracking of customer behavior in stores. Shopping path data which records each customer's position and time information is attracting attention as new marketing data. However, there are no proposed marketing models which can identify good customers from huge amounts of time series data on customer movement in the store. This research aims to use shopping path data resulting from tracking customer behavior in the store, using information on the sequence of visiting each product zone in the store and staying time at each product zone, to find how they affect purchasing. To discover useful knowledge for store management, shopping paths data has been transformed into sequence data including information on visit sequence and staying times in the store, and LCMseq has been applied to them to extract frequent sequence patterns. In this paper, we find characteristic in-store behavior patterns of good customers by using actual data of a Japanese supermarket.","Sequential pattern mining,Path data,LCM sequence,Decision tree,Data mining","WARNINGS,PATHS","Nakahara, Takanobu@Kansai Univ, Data Min Lab, Suita, Osaka, Japan::Yada, Katsutoshi@Kansai Univ, Fac Commerce, Suita, Osaka, Japan","Nakahara, Takanobu@Kansai University::Yada, Katsutoshi@Kansai University",not exist,"Adolescents' attention to beer and cigarette print ads and associated product warnings+Fox, RJ; Krugman, DM; Fletcher, JE; et al.+JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING+FAL 1998::The Traveling Salesman Goes Shopping: The Systematic Deviations of Grocery Paths from TSP Optimality+Hui, Sam K.; Fader, Peter S.; Bradlow, Eric T.+MARKETING SCIENCE+MAY-JUN 2009::The Influence of Shopping Path Length on Purchase Behavior in Grocery Store+Kholod, Marina; Nakahara, Takanobu; Azuma, Haruka; et al.+KNOWLEDGE-BASED AND INTELLIGENT INFORMATION AND ENGINEERING SYSTEMS, PT III+2010::DO ADOLESCENTS ATTEND TO WARNINGS IN CIGARETTE ADVERTISING - AN EYE-TRACKING APPROACH+KRUGMAN, DM; FOX, RJ; FLETCHER, JE; et al.+JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING RESEARCH+NOV-DEC 1994::An exploratory look at supermarket shopping paths+Larson, JS; Bradlow, ET; Fader, PS+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING+DEC 2005::Modeling partial customer churn: On the value of first product-category purchase sequences+Migueis, V.

Time series classification by class-specific Mahalanobis distance measures,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0110-6,OCT 2012,39,12,"To classify time series by nearest neighbors, we need to specify or learn one or several distance measures. We consider variations of the Mahalanobis distance measures which rely on the inverse covariance matrix of the data. Unfortunately-for time series data-the covariance matrix has often low rank. To alleviate this problem we can either use a pseudoinverse, covariance shrinking or limit the matrix to its diagonal. We review these alternatives and benchmark them against competitive methods such as the related Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification (LMNN) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. As we expected, we find that the DTW is superior, but the Mahalanobis distance measures are one to two orders of magnitude faster. To get best results with Mahalanobis distance measures, we recommend learning one distance measure per class using either covariance shrinking or the diagonal approach.","Time-series classification,Distance measure learning,Nearest Neighbor,Mahalanobis distance measure","NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFICATION,PATTERN-RECOGNITION,SPEECH","Prekopcsak, Zoltan@Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary::Lemire, Daniel@Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, LICEF, Montreal, PQ H2X 3P2, Canada","Prekopcsak, Zoltan@Budapest University of Technology & Economics::Lemire, Daniel@University of Quebec@University of Quebec Montreal","Lemire, Daniel@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3306-6922","no title+Breiman, L; Friedman, J; Stone, JA<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Olshen, RA</span>.+Classificationandregressiontrees+1998::Large margin nearest local mean classifier+Chai, Jing; Liu, Hongwei; Chen, Bo; et al.+SIGNAL PROCESSING+JAN 2010::Adaptive dissimilarity index for measuring time series proximity+Chouakria, Ahlame Douzal; Nagabhushan, Panduranga Naidu+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+MAR 2007::Class-based attribute weighting for time series classification+Csatari, B; Prekopcsak, Z.+2010 P 14 INT STUD C+2010::Querying and Mining of Time Series Data: Experimental Comparison of Representations and Distance Measures+Ding, H.; Trajcevski, G.; Scheuermann, P.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wang, X.; Keogh, E</span>.+VLDB+2008::The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems+Fisher, RA+ANNALS OF EUGENICS+SEP 1936::An adaptable time warping distance for time series learning+Gaudin, Remi; Nicoloyannis, Nicolas+ICMLA 2006: 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS+2006::Discriminant adaptive nearest neighbor classification+Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUN 1996::no title+ISHIKAWA Y+VLDB+1998::MINIMUM PREDICTION RESIDUAL PRINCIPLE APPLIED TO SPEECH RECOGNITION+ITAKURA, F+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ACOUSTICS SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING+1975::A method of learning weighted similarity function to improve the performance of nearest neighbor+Jahromi, Mansoor Zolghadri; Parvinnia, Elham; John, Robert+INFORMATION SCIENCES+AUG 5 2009::Weighted dynamic time warping for time series classification+Jeong, Young-Seon; Jeong, Myong K.; Omitaomu, Olufemi A.+PATTERN RECOGNITION+SEP 2011::no title+Keogh; Xi, E.

Preliminary estimators for a mixture model of ordinal data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0111-5,OCT 2012,29,16,"In this paper, we propose preliminary estimators for the parameters of a mixture distribution introduced for the analysis of ordinal data where the mixture components are given by a Combination of a discrete Uniform and a shifted Binomial distribution (cub model). After reviewing some preliminary concepts related to the meaning of parameters which characterize such models, we introduce estimators which are related to the location and heterogeneity of the observed distributions, respectively, in order to accelerate the EM procedure for the maximum likelihood estimation. A simulation experiment has been performed to investigate their main features and to confirm their usefulness. A check of the proposal on real case studies and some comments conclude the paper.","Ordinal data,CUB models,Preliminary estimators","EM ALGORITHM,PREFERENCES,LIKELIHOOD,VALUES","Iannario, Maria@Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Stat Sci, I-80138 Naples, Italy","Iannario, Maria@University of Naples Federico II",not exist,"no title+AGRESTI, ALAN.+Analysis of ordinal categorical data+2010::Choosing starting values for the EM algorithm for getting the highest likelihood in multivariate Gaussian mixture models+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::Mixture Models for Ordinal Data+Breen, Richard; Luijkx, Ruud+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+AUG 2010::Modelling approaches for ordinal data: the case of Orientation Service evaluation+Capecchi, S; Piccolo, D.+Quaderni di Statistica+2010::A mixture model for preferences data analysis+D'Elia, A; Piccolo, D+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 1 2005::A latent class model for discrete choice analysis: contrasts with mixed logit+Greene, WH; Hensher, DA+TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL+SEP 2003::Identifiability of Finite Mixtures of Multinomial Logit Models with Varying and Fixed Effects+Gruen, Bettina; Leisch, Friedrich+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+NOV 2008::no title+IANNARIO, M.; PICCOLO, D.+A program in R for CUB models inference, Version 2.0+2009::CUB models: statistical methods and empirical evidence+Iannario, M.; Piccolo, D.+Modern Analysis of Customer Surveys+2012::Selecting feeling covariates in rating surveys+Iannario, M.+Statistica Applicazioni+2008::On the identi ability of a mixture model for ordinal data+Iannario, Maria+METRON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+APR 2010::A New Statistical Model for the Analysis of Customer Satisfaction+Iannario, Maria; Piccolo, Domenico+QUALITY TECHNOLOGY AND QUANTITATIVE MANAGEMENT+JUN 2010::Modelling shelter choices in a class of mixture models for ordinal responses+Iannario, Maria+STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS+MAR 2012::Choosing initial values for the EM algorithm for finite mixtures+Karlis, D; Xekalaki, E+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::no title+Lindsey, JK.+Parametric Statistical Inference+1996::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::REGRESSION-MODELS FOR ORDINAL DATA+MCCULLAGH, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1980::no title+McLachlan, G; Peel, D.+Finite mixture models+2000::Testing for the Supremacy of a Multinomial Cell Probability+Nettleton, Dan+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2009::no title+Pardo, L.+Statistical Inference Based on Divergence Measures+2006::ESTIMATION OF A PROBABILITY DENSITY-FUNCTION AND MODE+PARZEN, E+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1962::Observed information matrix in MUB models+Piccolo, D.+Quaderni di Stat+2006::On the moments of a mixture of uniform and shifted binomial random variables.+Piccolo, D.+Quaderni di Stat+2003::A new approach for modelling consumers' preferences+Piccolo, Domenico; D'Elia, Angela+FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE+APR 2008::no title+Rao, C.

Wavelet-RKHS-based functional statistical classification,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0112-4,OCT 2012,29,3,"A functional classification methodology, based on the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) theory, is proposed for discrimination of gene expression profiles. The parameter function involved in the definition of the functional logistic regression is univocally and consistently estimated, from the minimization of the penalized negative log-likelihood over a RKHS generated by a suitable wavelet basis. An iterative descendent method, the gradient method, is applied for solving the corresponding minimization problem, i.e., for computing the functional estimate. Temporal gene expression data involved in the yeast cell cycle are classified with the wavelet-RKHS-based discrimination methodology considered. A simulation study is developed for testing the performance of this statistical classification methodology in comparison with other statistical discrimination procedures.","Functional data analysis,Gene expression profiles,Penalized logistic regression,Reproducing kernel Hilbert space,Wavelet decomposition,Yeast cell cycle","SMOOTHING PARAMETER SELECTION,GAUSSIAN-BASIS EXPANSIONS,KERNEL HILBERT-SPACES,LOGISTIC DISCRIMINATION,REGRESSION-MODELS,LINEAR-MODELS","Rincon, M.@Univ Granada, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-18071 Granada, Spain::Ruiz-Medina, M.

Clustering of functional data in a low-dimensional subspace,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0113-3,OCT 2012,33,8,"To find optimal clusters of functional objects in a lower-dimensional subspace of data, a sequential method called tandem analysis, is often used, though such a method is problematic. A new procedure is developed to find optimal clusters of functional objects and also find an optimal subspace for clustering, simultaneously. The method is based on the k-means criterion for functional data and seeks the subspace that is maximally informative about the clustering structure in the data. An efficient alternating least-squares algorithm is described, and the proposed method is extended to a regularized method. Analyses of artificial and real data examples demonstrate that the proposed method gives correct and interpretable results.","Functional data,Clustering,Low-dimensional space,Dimension reduction,Smoothing","PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS,FACTORIAL,CURVES,CHOICE,NUMBER,NORM","Yamamoto, Michio@Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Div Math Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 5608531, Japan","Yamamoto, Michio@Osaka University",not exist,"Unsupervised curve clustering using B-splines+Abraham, C; Cornillon, PA; Matzner-Lober, E; et al.+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2003::Cluster analysis and marketing research+Arabie, P.; Hubert, L.+Advanced Methods in Marketing Research+1994::PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS OF SAMPLED FUNCTIONS+BESSE, P; RAMSAY, JO+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 1986::Simultaneous non-parametric regressions of unbalanced longitudinal data+Besse, PC; Cardot, H; Ferraty, F+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 12 1997::Kernel-based functional principal components+Boente, G; Fraiman, R+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUL 15 2000::Model-based clustering of time series in group-specific functional subspaces+Bouveyron, Charles; Jacques, Julien+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+DEC 2011::K-means clustering in a low-dimensional Euclidean space+Carroll, J.

The influence function of the TCLUST robust clustering procedure,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0107-1,JUL 2012,20,3,"The TCLUST procedure performs robust clustering with the aim of finding clusters with different scatter structures and weights. An Eigenvalues Ratio constraint is considered by TCLUST in order to achieve a wide range of clustering alternatives depending on the allowed differences among cluster scatter matrices. Moreover, this constraint avoids finding uninteresting spurious clusters. In order to guarantee the robustness of the method against the presence of outliers and background noise, the method allows for trimming of a given proportion of observations self-determined by the data. Based on this ""impartial trimming"", the procedure is assumed to have good robustness properties. As it was done for the trimmed k-means method, this article studies robustness properties of the TCLUST procedure in the univariate case with two clusters by means of the influence function. The conclusion is that the TCLUST has a robustness behavior close to that of the trimmed k-means in spite of the fact that it addresses a more general clustering approach.","Heterogeneous clustering,Influence function,Trimming,Robustness","TRIMMED K-MEANS,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS","Ruwet, C.@Univ Liege, Dept Math, B-4000 Liege, Belgium::Garcia-Escudero, L.

Dissimilarity and similarity measures for comparing dendrograms and their applications,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0106-2,JUL 2012,30,1,"In this paper we propose a new index Z for measuring the dissimilarity between two hierarchical clusterings (or dendrograms). This index is a metric since it satisfies the axioms of non-negativity, symmetry and triangle inequality. A desirable property of this index is that it can be decomposed into the contributions pertaining to each stage of the hierarchies. We show the relations of such components with the currently used criteria for comparing two partitions. We obtain a global similarity index as the complement to one of the suggested dissimilarity and we derive its adjustment for agreement due to chance. We obtain similarity indexes pertaining to each stage of the hierarchies as the complement to one of the additive parts of the global distance Z. We consider the use of the proposed distance for more than two dendrograms and its use for the consensus of classifications and variable selection in cluster analysis.

Orthogonal rotation in PCAMIX,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0105-3,JUL 2012,17,9,"Kiers (Psychometrika 56:197-212, 1991) considered the orthogonal rotation in PCAMIX, a principal component method for a mixture of qualitative and quantitative variables. PCAMIX includes the ordinary principal component analysis and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) as special cases. In this paper, we give a new presentation of PCAMIX where the principal components and the squared loadings are obtained from a Singular Value Decomposition. The loadings of the quantitative variables and the principal coordinates of the categories of the qualitative variables are also obtained directly. In this context, we propose a computationally efficient procedure for varimax rotation in PCAMIX and a direct solution for the optimal angle of rotation. A simulation study shows the good computational behavior of the proposed algorithm. An application on a real data set illustrates the interest of using rotation in MCA.

Adaptation of interval PCA to symbolic histogram variables,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-012-0108-0,JUL 2012,19,9,"This paper is an adaptation of symbolic interval Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to histogram data. We proposed two methodologies. The first one involved three steps: the coding of bins of histogram, the ordinary PCA of means of variables and the representation of dispersion of symbolic observations we call concepts. For the representation of dispersion of these concepts we proposed the transformation of histograms into intervals. Then, we suggest the projection of the hypercubes or the interval lengths associated to each concept on the principal axes of the ordinary PCA of means. In the second methodology, we proposed the use of the three previous steps with the angular transformation.","Symbolic histogram variable,Hypercube,Tchebychev inequality,Angular transformation,Procrustean analysis",,"Makosso-Kallyth, Sun@CRCHUQ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada::Diday, Edwin@Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, F-75775 Paris 16, France","Makosso-Kallyth, Sun@Laval University::Diday, Edwin@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@University of Paris Dauphine",not exist,"no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::no title+Billard, L.; Diday, E.+Symbolic data analysis: Conceptual statistics and data mining+2006::no title+Bishop, YMM; Fienberg, SF; Holland, PW.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis+1975::no title+Bock, H.

A latent variables approach for clustering mixed binary and continuous variables within a Gaussian mixture model,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-011-0101-z,APR 2012,35,10,"For clustering objects, we often collect not only continuous variables, but binary attributes as well. This paper proposes a model-based clustering approach with mixed binary and continuous variables where each binary attribute is generated by a latent continuous variable that is dichotomized with a suitable threshold value, and where the scores of the latent variables are estimated from the binary data. In economics, such variables are called utility functions and the assumption is that the binary attributes (the presence or the absence of a public service or utility) are determined by low and high values of these functions. In genetics, the latent response is interpreted as the 'liability' to develop a qualitative trait or phenotype. The estimated scores of the latent variables, together with the observed continuous ones, allow to use a multivariate Gaussian mixture model for clustering, instead of using a mixture of discrete and continuous distributions. After describing the method, this paper presents the results of both simulated and real-case data and compares the performances of the multivariate Gaussian mixture model and of a mixture of joint multivariate and multinomial distributions. Results show that the former model outperforms the mixture model for variables with different scales, both in terms of classification error rate and reproduction of the clusters means.","Clustering,E-government,Information and communication technologies,Latent variables,Mixed mode data,Scores estimate","TETRACHORIC CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT,MARKET-SEGMENTATION,RESPONSE MODEL","Morlini, Isabella@Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, I-41100 Modena, Italy","Morlini, Isabella@Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia","Morlini, Isabella@F-5577-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2900-2742","MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::The goodness of fit of latent trait models in attitude measurement+Bartholomew, DJ; Tzamourani, P+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1999::ADAPTIVE EAP ESTIMATION OF ABILITY IN A MICROCOMPUTER ENVIRONMENT+BOCK, RD; MISLEVY, RJ+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+1982::Inferential methods for the tetrachoric correlation coefficient+Bonett, DG; Price, RM+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SUM 2005::GAUSSIAN PARSIMONIOUS CLUSTERING MODELS+CELEUX, G; GOVAERT, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION+MAY 1995::K-modes clustering+Chaturvedi, A; Green, PE; Carroll, JD+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+2001::A feature-based approach to market segmentation via overlapping K-centroids clustering+Chaturvedi, A; Carroll, JD; Green, PE; et al.+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+AUG 1997::APPROXIMATING THE TETRACHORIC CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT+EDWARDS, JH; EDWARDS, AWF+BIOMETRICS+1984::The clustering of mixed- mode data: a comparison of possible approaches+Everitt, BS; Merette, C.+J Appl Stat+1990::A FINITE MIXTURE MODEL FOR THE CLUSTERING OF MIXED-MODE DATA+EVERITT, BS+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+APR 1988::Modification indices for the 2-PL and the nominal response model+Glas, CAW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1999::Comparison of models for estimating the joint probability of a weather event+Gringorten, II.+J Appl Meteorol+1971::Tetrachoric correlation coefficient+Harris, B.+Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences+1988::SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS AS A SPECIFICATION ERROR+HECKMAN, JJ+ECONOMETRICA+1979::A COMPUTATIONAL STUDY OF REPLICATED CLUSTERING WITH AN APPLICATION TO MARKET-SEGMENTATION+HELSEN, K; GREEN, PE+DECISION SCIENCES+NOV-DEC 1991::Mixture model clustering using the Multimix program+Hunt, L; Jorgensen, M.+Aust N Z J Stat+1999::no title+Joreskog, KG; Sorbom, D.+PRELIS 2 User's Reference Guide+1999::Aplication of tetrachoric and polychoric correlation coefficients to forecast verification+Juras, J; Pasaric, Z.+Geofizika+2006::Modeling conditional probability+Juras, J.+J Appl Meteorol+1982::Mixture separation for mixed-mode data+Lawrence, CJ; Krzanowski, WJ+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAR 1996::IDENTIFICATION OF BINARY RESPONSE MODELS+MANSKI, CF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1988::no title+McLachlan, G; Peel, D.+Finite mixture models+2000::Mixed Mode Data Clustering: An Approach Based on Tetrachoric Correlations+Morlini, Isabella+CLASSIFICATION AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS FOR COMPLEX DATA STRUCTURES+2011::FULL-INFORMATION ITEM FACTOR-ANALYSIS - APPLICATIONS OF EAP SCORES+MURAKI, E; ENGELHARD, G+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 1985::Tables of bivariate normal distribution function and related functions+no author+NBS APPL MATH SER+1959::Wskaznik podobienstwa wynikow podzialow+Nowak, E.+Przeglad Statystyczny+1985::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF THE POLYCHLORIC CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT+OLSSON, U+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1979::On theories of association+Pearson, K; Heron, D+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1913::Mathematical contributions to the theory of evolution.

A consequence is that weighted kappa with linear weights can be interpreted as a weighted average of the linearly weighted kappas corresponding to the m x m tables, where the weights are the denominators of the kappas.

Analyzing multiset data by the Power STATIS-ACT method,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-011-0085-8,APR 2012,44,2,"The STATIS-ACT method is a generalization of principal component analysis used to study simultaneously several data tables measured on the same observation units or variables. The goal of this method is to analyze the relationship between these data tables and to combine them into a compromise matrix corresponding to an optimal agreement between the data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to this method, referred to as the Power STATIS-ACT method, where the compromise matrix is derived from a general s-power based criterion (s >= 1) and investigate some of its theoretical and practical properties. Special attention is devoted to the 1-power case which makes the introduction of low rank versions of the compromise possible. We also examine the effect of varying the power parameter s on the compromise solutions. All results are illustrated with a number of real data tables.","STATIS-ACT method,Power based criterion,Multiset data,Three-way data,RV-coefficient","GENERALIZED PROCRUSTES ANALYSIS,MULTIPLE FACTOR-ANALYSIS,COMPONENT ANALYSIS,K-SETS,TABLES,TOOL","Benasseni, Jacques@Univ Rennes 2, IRMAR, UMR CNRS 6625, F-35043 Rennes, France::Dosse, Mohammed Bennani@Univ Rennes 2, IRMAR, UMR CNRS 6625, F-35043 Rennes, France","Benasseni, Jacques@Universite Rennes 2::Dosse, Mohammed Bennani@Universite Rennes 2",not exist,"INTERPRETATION OF TRANSFORMED AXES IN MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS+ARNOLD, GM; COLLINS, AJ+APPLIED STATISTICS-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C+1993::Generalization of canonical correlation analysis to three or more sets of variables+Carroll, J.D.+Proc. 76th Annu.

Model-based clustering of time series in group-specific functional subspaces,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-011-0095-6,DEC 2011,24,17,"This work develops a general procedure for clustering functional data which adapts the clustering method high dimensional data clustering (HDDC), originally proposed in the multivariate context. The resulting clustering method, called funHDDC, is based on a functional latent mixture model which fits the functional data in group-specific functional subspaces. By constraining model parameters within and between groups, a family of parsimonious models is exhibited which allow to fit onto various situations. An estimation procedure based on the EM algorithm is proposed for determining both the model parameters and the group-specific functional subspaces. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed approach performs better or similarly than classical two-step clustering methods while providing useful interpretations of the groups and avoiding the uneasy choice of the discretization technique. In particular, funHDDC appears to always outperform HDDC applied on spline coefficients.","Functional data,Time series clustering,Model-based clustering,Group-specific functional subspaces,Functional PCA","CLASSIFICATION,MIXTURES","Bouveyron, Charles@Univ Paris 01, Lab SAMM, EA 4543, F-75013 Paris, France::Jacques, Julien@Univ Lille 1, UFR Math, INRIA Lille Nord Europe, Lab Paul Painleve,UMR CNRS 8524, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France","Bouveyron, Charles@Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne@heSam Universite::Jacques, Julien@Universite Lille-Nord-de-France (ComUE)@Fondation I-SITE ULNE@Inria@Universite de Lille",not exist,"no title+AGUILERA A+CHEMOM INTELL LAB SY+2011::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::Initializing EM using the properties of its trajectories in Gaussian mixtures+Biernacki, C+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+AUG 2004::High-dimensional data clustering+Bouveyron, C.; Girard, S.; Schmid, C.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 15 2007::SCREE TEST FOR NUMBER OF FACTORS+CATTELL, RB+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1966::GAUSSIAN PARSIMONIOUS CLUSTERING MODELS+CELEUX, G; GOVAERT, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION+MAY 1995::DEFINING PROBABILITY DENSITY FOR A DISTRIBUTION OF RANDOM FUNCTIONS+Delaigle, Aurore; Hall, Peter+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2010::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Modeling environmental data by functional principal component logistic regression+Escabias, M; Aguilera, AM; Valderrama, MJ+ENVIRONMETRICS+FEB 2005::no title+Ferraty, F.; Vieu, P.+Nonparametric Functional Data Analysis+2006::Model-based clustering of multiple time series+Fruhwirth-Schnatter, S.; Kaufmann, S.+J.

Model-based clustering and segmentation of time series with changes in regime,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-011-0096-5,DEC 2011,21,21,"Mixture model-based clustering, usually applied to multidimensional data, has become a popular approach in many data analysis problems, both for its good statistical properties and for the simplicity of implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Within the context of a railway application, this paper introduces a novel mixture model for dealing with time series that are subject to changes in regime. The proposed approach, called ClustSeg, consists in modeling each cluster by a regression model in which the polynomial coefficients vary according to a discrete hidden process. In particular, this approach makes use of logistic functions to model the (smooth or abrupt) transitions between regimes. The model parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method solved by an EM algorithm. This approach can also be regarded as a clustering approach which operates by finding groups of time series having common changes in regime. In addition to providing a time series partition, it therefore provides a time series segmentation. The problem of selecting the optimal numbers of clusters and segments is solved by means of the Bayesian Information Criterion. The ClustSeg approach is shown to be efficient using a variety of simulated time series and real-world time series of electrical power consumption from rail switching operations.","Clustering,Time series,Change in regime,Mixture model,Regression mixture,Hidden logistic process,EM algorithm","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,FUNCTIONAL DATA,MIXTURE MODEL","Same, Allou@Univ Paris Est, IFSTTAR, GRETTIA, F-93160 Noisy Le Grand, France::Chamroukhi, Faicel@Univ Paris Est, IFSTTAR, GRETTIA, F-93160 Noisy Le Grand, France::Govaert, Gerard@Univ Technol Compiegne, HEUDIASYC, CNRS, UMR 6599, F-60205 Compiegne, France::Aknin, Patrice@Univ Paris Est, IFSTTAR, GRETTIA, F-93160 Noisy Le Grand, France","Same, Allou@IFSTTAR::Chamroukhi, Faicel@IFSTTAR::Govaert, Gerard@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@University of Technology of Compiegne::Aknin, Patrice@IFSTTAR",not exist,"MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2000::GAUSSIAN PARSIMONIOUS CLUSTERING MODELS+CELEUX, G; GOVAERT, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION+MAY 1995::A hidden process regression model for functional data description.

Panel data analysis: a survey on model-based clustering of time series,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-011-0100-0,DEC 2011,60,7,Clustering is a widely used statistical tool to determine subsets in a given data set. Frequently used clustering methods are mostly based on distance measures and cannot easily be extended to cluster time series within a panel or a longitudinal data set. The paper reviews recently suggested approaches to model-based clustering of panel or longitudinal data based on finite mixture models. Several approaches are considered that are suitable both for continuous and for categorical time series observations. Bayesian estimation through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is described in detail and various criteria to select the number of clusters are reviewed.

Correcting Jaccard and other similarity indices for chance agreement in cluster analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-011-0090-y,OCT 2011,38,16,"Correcting a similarity index for chance agreement requires computing its expectation under fixed marginal totals of a matching counts matrix. For some indices, such as Jaccard, Rogers and Tanimoto, Sokal and Sneath, and Gower and Legendre the expectations cannot be easily found. We show how such similarity indices can be expressed as functions of other indices and expectations found by approximations such that approximate correction is possible. A second approach is based on Taylor series expansion. A simulation study illustrates the effectiveness of the resulting correction of similarity indices using structured and unstructured data generated from bivariate normal distributions.","Similarity indices,Matching counts matrix,Correction for chance agreement,Jaccard index,Cluster analysis,Comparing partitions","2 HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERINGS,COEFFICIENTS,ASSOCIATION,CRITERIA","Albatineh, Ahmed N.@Florida Int Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Miami, FL 33199 USA::Niewiadomska-Bugaj, Magdalena@Western Michigan Univ, Dept Stat, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA","Albatineh, Ahmed N.@Florida International University@State University System of Florida::Niewiadomska-Bugaj, Magdalena@Western Michigan University",not exist,"MCS: A Method for Finding the Number of Clusters+Albatineh, Ahmed N.; Niewiadomska-Bugaj, Magdalena+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+JUL 2011::On similarity indices and correction for chance agreement+Albatineh, Ahmed N.; Niewiadomska-Bugaj, Magdalena; Mihalko, Daniel+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2006::Means and variances for a family of similarity indices used in cluster analysis+Albatineh, Ahmed N.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 2010::Coefficient of Racial Likeness und Durchschnittliche Differenz+Czekanowski, J.+Anothropologidcher+Jan. 1932::MEASURES OF THE AMOUNT OF ECOLOGIC ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SPECIES+DICE, LR+ECOLOGY+1945::no title+Dubes, R.C; Jain, A.K.+Algorithms for clustering data+1988::A modification of the Jaccard-Tanimoto similarity index for diverse selection of chemical compounds using binary strings+Fligner, MA; Verducci, JS; Blower, PE+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2002::A METHOD FOR COMPARING 2 HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERINGS+FOWLKES, EB; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::METRIC AND EUCLIDEAN PROPERTIES OF DISSIMILARITY COEFFICIENTS+GOWER, JC; LEGENDRE, P+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1986::Characteristics and relationships of the Farinosae.

A variety of techniques have been developed for linear dimension reduction to be applied prior to classification. However, there is no single definitive method that works best under all circumstances. Rather a best method depends on various data characteristics. We develop a two-step adaptive procedure in which a best dimension reduction method is first selected based on the various data characteristics, which is then applied to the data at hand. It is shown using both simulated and real life data that such a procedure can significantly reduce the misclassification rate.","Dimension reduction,Adaptive procedure,Classification,Meta-learning","FISHER CRITERION,DISCRIMINATION","Luebke, Karsten@Hsch Oekonomie & Management, D-44139 Dortmund, Germany::Weihs, Claus@Dortmund Univ Technol, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","Luebke, Karsten@Unknow::Weihs, Claus@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"Partial least squares for discrimination+Barker, M; Rayens, W+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+MAR 2003::no title+Brazdil, P.; Giraud-Carrier, C.; Soares, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Vilalta, R</span>.+Metalearning+2009::Ranking learning algorithms: Using IBL and meta-learning on accuracy and time results+Brazdil, PB; Soares, C; Da Costa, JP+MACHINE LEARNING+MAR 2003::ASYMPTOTICS OF GRAPHICAL PROJECTION PURSUIT+DIACONIS, P; FREEDMAN, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1984::METHOD FOR SIMULATING NON-NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+FLEISHMAN, AI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1978::PENALIZED DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS+HASTIE, T; BUJA, A; TIBSHIRANI, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 1995::A theorem on the uncorrelated optimal discriminant vectors+Jin, Z; Yang, JY; Tang, ZM; et al.+PATTERN RECOGNITION+OCT 2001::no title+LeLe, S.; Richtsmeier, J.

Multiple imputation in principal component analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-011-0086-7,OCT 2011,36,33,"The available methods to handle missing values in principal component analysis only provide point estimates of the parameters (axes and components) and estimates of the missing values. To take into account the variability due to missing values a multiple imputation method is proposed. First a method to generate multiple imputed data sets from a principal component analysis model is defined. Then, two ways to visualize the uncertainty due to missing values onto the principal component analysis results are described. The first one consists in projecting the imputed data sets onto a reference configuration as supplementary elements to assess the stability of the individuals (respectively of the variables). The second one consists in performing a principal component analysis on each imputed data set and fitting each obtained configuration onto the reference one with Procrustes rotation. The latter strategy allows to assess the variability of the principal component analysis parameters induced by the missing values. The methodology is then evaluated from a real data set.","Principal component analysis,Missing values,EM algorithm,Multiple imputation,Bootstrap,Procrustes rotation","MISSING VALUES,NUMBER","Josse, Julie@Agrocampus Ouest, F-35042 Rennes, France::Pages, Jerome@Agrocampus Ouest, F-35042 Rennes, France::Husson, Francois@Agrocampus Ouest, F-35042 Rennes, France","Josse, Julie@Agrocampus Ouest::Pages, Jerome@Agrocampus Ouest::Husson, Francois@Agrocampus Ouest","martel, celine@M-9779-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1800-4558","Principal component analysis of dissolution data with missing elements+Adams, E; Walczak, B; Vervaet, C; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS+MAR 2 2002::no title+BRO R+ANAL BIOANAL CHEM+2008::Multi-way analysis in the food industry - models, algorithms, and applications+Bro, R.+Tech. rep+1998::Models and Uses of Principal Component Analysis+Caussinus, H.+Multidimensional Data Analysis+1986::Assessing sample variability in the visualization techniques related to principal component analysis: bootstrap and alternative simulation methods+Chateau, F.; Lebart, L.+COMPSTAT.

Consensus of partitions : a constructive approach,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-011-0087-6,OCT 2011,22,18,"Given a profile (family) I of partitions of a set of objects or items X, we try to establish a consensus partition containing a maximum number of joined or separated pairs in X that are also joined or separated in the profile. To do so, we define a score function, S (I) associated to any partition on X. Consensus partitions for I are those maximizing this function. Therefore, these consensus partitions have the median property for the profile and the symmetric difference distance. This optimization problem can be solved, in certain cases, by integer linear programming. We define a polynomial heuristic which can be applied to partitions on a large set of items. In cases where an optimal solution can be computed, we show that the partitions built by this algorithm are very close to the optimum which is reached in practically all the cases, except for some sets of bipartitions.","Partitions,Consensus,Transfer distance,Simulation","TRANSFER DISTANCE,CLUSTER-ANALYSIS,ALGORITHM","Guenoche, Alain@IML CNRS, F-13009 Marseille, France","Guenoche, Alain@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)",not exist,"The Median Procedure for Partitions+Barthelemy, J.

Network ensemble clustering using latent roles,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-010-0074-3,JUL 2011,40,5,"We present a clustering method for collections of graphs based on the assumptions that graphs in the same cluster have a similar role structure and that the respective roles can be founded on implicit vertex types. Given a network ensemble (a collection of attributed graphs with some substantive commonality), we start by partitioning the set of all vertices based on attribute similarity. Projection of each graph onto the resulting vertex types yields feature vectors of equal dimensionality, irrespective of the original graph sizes. These feature vectors are then subjected to standard clustering methods. This approach is motivated by social network concepts, and we demonstrate its utility on an ensemble of personal networks of migrants, where we extract structurally similar groups and show their resemblance to predicted acculturation strategies.","Social network analysis,Clustering,Network ensembles,Acculturation","GRAPHS,ACCULTURATION,ALGORITHMS,DISTANCE","Brandes, Ulrik@Univ Konstanz, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Constance, Germany::Lerner, Juergen@Univ Konstanz, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Constance, Germany::Nagel, Uwe@Univ Konstanz, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Constance, Germany","Brandes, Ulrik@University of Konstanz::Lerner, Juergen@University of Konstanz::Nagel, Uwe@University of Konstanz",not exist,"Immigration, acculturation, and adaptation+Berry, JW+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW-PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE+JAN 1997::Models of social networks based on social distance attachment+Boguna, M; Pastor-Satorras, R; Diaz-Guilera, A; et al.+PHYSICAL REVIEW E+NOV 2004::Recognizing modes of acculturation in personal networks of migrants+Brandes, Ulrik -; Lernera, Juergen; Lubbers, Miranda J.; et al.+APPLICATIONS OF SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS+2010::Structural Trends in Network Ensembles+Brandes, Ulrik; Lerner, Juergen; Nagel, Uwe; et al.+COMPLEX NETWORKS+2009::Visual statistics for collections of clustered graphs+Brandes, Ulrik; Lerner, Juergen; Lubbers, Miranda J.; et al.+IEEE PACIFIC VISUALISATION SYMPOSIUM 2008, PROCEEDINGS+2008::Graph clustering using the weighted minimum common supergraph+Bunke, H; Foggia, P; Guidobaldi, C; et al.+GRAPH BASED REPRESENTATIONS IN PATTERN RECOGNITION, PROCEEDINGS+2003::Combinatorial search versus genetic algorithms: A case study based on the generalized median graph problem+Bunke, H; Munger, A; Jiang, XY+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+NOV 1999::Inexact graph matching for structural pattern recognition+Bunke, H.; Allermann, G.+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+MAY 1983::Some simple algorithms for structural comparison+Butts, C.T.; Carley, K.M.+Computational &amp; Mathematical Organization Theory+Dec. 2005::Frequent substructure-based approaches for classifying chemical compounds+Deshpande, M; Kuramochi, M; Wale, N; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING+AUG 2005::Comparing social networks: size, density, and local structure+Faust, K.+Metodoloski zvezki.+2006::Comparing networks across space and time, size and species+Faust, K; Skvoretz, J+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 2002, VOL 32+2002::Community detection in graphs+Fortunato, Santo+PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS+FEB 2010::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::A survey of kernels for structured data+Gartner, T.+ACM SIGKDD Explor.

Clusterwise analysis for multiblock component methods,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-017-0296-8,JUN 2018,38,0,"Multiblock component methods are applied to data sets for which several blocks of variables are measured on a same set of observations with the goal to analyze the relationships between these blocks of variables. In this article, we focus on multiblock component methods that integrate the information found in several blocks of explanatory variables in order to describe and explain one set of dependent variables. In the following, multiblock PLS and multiblock redundancy analysis are chosen, as particular cases of multiblock component methods when one set of variables is explained by a set of predictor variables that is organized into blocks. Because these multiblock techniques assume that the observations come from a homogeneous population they will provide suboptimal results when the observations actually come from different populations. A strategy to palliate this problem-presented in this article-is to use a technique such as clusterwise regression in order to identify homogeneous clusters of observations. This approach creates two new methods that provide clusters that have their own sets of regression coefficients. This combination of clustering and regression improves the overall quality of the prediction and facilitates the interpretation. In addition, the minimization of a well-defined criterion-by means of a sequential algorithm-ensures that the algorithm converges monotonously. Finally, the proposed method is distribution-free and can be used when the explanatory variables outnumber the observations within clusters. The proposed clusterwise multiblock methods are illustrated with of a simulation study and a (simulated) example from marketing.","Multiblock component method,Clusterwise regression,Typological regression,Cluster analysis,Dimension reduction","PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES,LINEAR-REGRESSION,MODELS","Bougeard, Stephanie@Anses French Agcy Food Environm & Occupat Hlth Sa, Dept Epidemiol, F-22440 Ploufragan, France::Abdi, Herve@Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA::Saporta, Gilbert@CEDRIC CNAM, 292 Rue St Martin, F-75141 Paris 03, France::Niang, Ndeye@CEDRIC CNAM, 292 Rue St Martin, F-75141 Paris 03, France","Bougeard, Stephanie@Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire de lAlimentation, de lEnvironnement du Travail (ANSES)::Abdi, Herve@University of Texas Dallas@University of Texas System::Saporta, Gilbert@Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM)@heSam Universite::Niang, Ndeye@Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM)@heSam Universite",not exist,"Partial least squares methods: partial least squares correlation and partial least square regression+Abdi, H; Williams, L.+Methods in molecular biology: computational toxicology+2012::The equivalence of two extremal problems and its application to the iterative classification of multivariate data+Bock, H.+Vortragsausarbeitung, Tagung.

Probabilistic clustering via Pareto solutions and significance tests,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0278-2,JUN 2018,37,0,"The present paper proposes a new strategy for probabilistic (often called model-based) clustering. It is well known that local maxima of mixture likelihoods can be used to partition an underlying data set. However, local maxima are rarely unique. Therefore, it remains to select the reasonable solutions, and in particular the desired one. Credible partitions are usually recognized by separation (and cohesion) of their clusters. We use here the p values provided by the classical tests of Wilks, Hotelling, and Behrens-Fisher to single out those solutions that are well separated by location. It has been shown that reasonable solutions to a clustering problem are related to Pareto points in a plot of scale balance vs. model fit of all local maxima. We briefly review this theory and propose as solutions all well-fitting Pareto points in the set of local maxima separated by location in the above sense. We also design a new iterative, parameter-free cutting plane algorithm for the multivariate Behrens-Fisher problem.","Cluster analysis,Probabilistic models,Mixture model,Classification model,Pareto solutions,Behrens-Fisher problem,Hotelling's T-2 statistic,Wilks' lambda","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION,NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS,PARAMETERS,MIXTURE,CONSISTENCY,SAMPLE,MODEL","Gallegos, Maria Teresa@Univ Passau, D-94030 Passau, Germany::Ritter, Gunter@Univ Passau, D-94030 Passau, Germany","Gallegos, Maria Teresa@University of Passau::Ritter, Gunter@University of Passau",not exist,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION PROCEDURES AND ASSOCIATED TESTS OF SIGNIFICANCE+AITCHISON, J; SILVEY, SD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1960::CLUSTER VALIDITY PROFILES+BAILEY, TA; DUBES, R+PATTERN RECOGNITION+1982::Ein Beitrag zur Fehlerberechnung bei wenigen Beobachtungen+Behrens, WU.+Landwirtschaftliche Jahrbucher.

Eigenvalues and constraints in mixture modeling: geometric and computational issues,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-017-0293-y,JUN 2018,72,0,"This paper presents a review about the usage of eigenvalues restrictions for constrained parameter estimation in mixtures of elliptical distributions according to the likelihood approach. The restrictions serve a twofold purpose: to avoid convergence to degenerate solutions and to reduce the onset of non interesting (spurious) local maximizers, related to complex likelihood surfaces. The paper shows how the constraints may play a key role in the theory of Euclidean data clustering. The aim here is to provide a reasoned survey of the constraints and their applications, considering the contributions of many authors and spanning the literature of the last 30 years.","Mixture model,EM algorithm,Eigenvalues,Model-based clustering","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR,LOCATION-SCALE DISTRIBUTIONS,EM ALGORITHM,FACTOR ANALYZERS,CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES,STRONG CONSISTENCY,GAUSSIAN MIXTURES,TRIMMING APPROACH,PARAMETER SPACES,CLUSTER-ANALYSIS","Angel Garcia-Escudero, Luis@Univ Valladolid, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Valladolid, Spain@Univ Valladolid, IMUVA, Valladolid, Spain::Gordaliza, Alfonso@Univ Valladolid, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Valladolid, Spain@Univ Valladolid, IMUVA, Valladolid, Spain::Greselin, Francesca@Milano Bicocca Univ, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy::Ingrassia, Salvatore@Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95128 Catania, Italy::Mayo-Iscar, Agustin@Univ Valladolid, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Valladolid, Spain@Univ Valladolid, IMUVA, Valladolid, Spain","Angel Garcia-Escudero, Luis@Universidad de Valladolid::Gordaliza, Alfonso@Universidad de Valladolid::Greselin, Francesca@University of Milano-Bicocca::Ingrassia, Salvatore@University of Catania::Mayo-Iscar, Agustin@Universidad de Valladolid","Greselin, Francesca@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2929-1748","no title+Aarts, EHL; van Laarhoven, PJM.+Simulated annealing: theory and practice+1988::Model-based classification via mixtures of multivariate t-distributions+Andrews, Jeffrey L.; McNicholas, Paul D.; Subedi, Sanjeena+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 1 2011::Extending mixtures of multivariate t-factor analyzers+Andrews, Jeffrey L.; McNicholas, Paul D.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUL 2011::The joint role of trimming and constraints in robust estimation for mixtures of Gaussian factor analyzers+Angel Garcia-Escudero, Luis; Gordaliza, Alfonso; Greselin, Francesca; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUL 2016::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::EM for mixtures+Baudry, J-P; Celeux, G.+Stat Comput+2015::Choosing starting values for the EM algorithm for getting the highest likelihood in multivariate Gaussian mixture models+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::Initializing EM using the properties of its trajectories in Gaussian mixtures+Biernacki, C+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+AUG 2004::Degeneracy in the maximum likelihood estimation of univariate Gaussian mixtures with EM+Biernacki, C; Chretien, S+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 15 2003::ON THE CONVERGENCE OF THE EM ALGORITHM+BOYLES, RA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1983::GAUSSIAN PARSIMONIOUS CLUSTERING MODELS+CELEUX, G; GOVAERT, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION+MAY 1995::no title+Cerioli, A; Garcia-Escudero, LA; Mayo-Iscar, A<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Riani, M</span>.+Finding the number of groups in modelbased clustering via constrained likelihoods+2016::A NOTE ON THE CONSISTENCY AND MAXIMA OF THE ROOTS OF LIKELIHOOD EQUATIONS+CHANDA, KC+BIOMETRIKA+1954::Penalized maximum likelihood estimator for normal mixtures+Ciuperca, G; Ridolfi, A; Idier, J+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2003::no title+Cramer, H.+Mathematical methods of statistics+1946::ESTIMATING COMPONENTS OF A MIXTURE OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+DAY, NE+BIOMETRIKA+1969::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Algorithms for non linear fitting+Dennis, JE.+P NATO ADV RES S CAM+1981::AN ALGORITHM FOR RESTRICTED LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION+DYKSTRA, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::no title+Fang, K; Anderson, T.+Statistical inference in elliptically contoured and related distributions+1990::MCLUST Version 3 for R: Normal mixture modeling and model-based clustering+Fraley, C.; Raftery, A.

A data driven equivariant approach to constrained Gaussian mixture modeling,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0279-1,JUN 2018,47,1,"Maximum likelihood estimation of Gaussian mixture models with different class-specific covariance matrices is known to be problematic. This is due to the unboundedness of the likelihood, together with the presence of spurious maximizers. Existing methods to bypass this obstacle are based on the fact that unboundedness is avoided if the eigenvalues of the covariance matrices are bounded away from zero. This can be done imposing some constraints on the covariance matrices, i.e. by incorporating a priori information on the covariance structure of the mixture components. The present work introduces a constrained approach, where the class conditional covariance matrices are shrunk towards a pre-specified target matrix Data-driven choices of the matrix when a priori information is not available, and the optimal amount of shrinkage are investigated. Then, constraints based on a data-driven are shown to be equivariant with respect to linear affine transformations, provided that the method used to select the target matrix be also equivariant. The effectiveness of the proposal is evaluated on the basis of a simulation study and an empirical example.","Model based clustering,Gaussian mixture models,Equivariant estimators","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,CLUSTER-ANALYSIS,T DISTRIBUTION,DISTRIBUTIONS,COMPONENTS,ESTIMATOR,EM","Rocci, Roberto@Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance DEF, Rome, Italy::Gattone, Stefano Antonio@Univ G dAnnunzio, DiSFPEQ, Chieti, Italy::Di Mari, Roberto@Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Catania, Italy","Rocci, Roberto@University of Rome Tor Vergata::Gattone, Stefano Antonio@G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara::Di Mari, Roberto@Unknow",not exist,"SOME INEQUALITIES ON CHARACTERISTIC ROOTS OF MATRICES+ANDERSON, TW; DASGUPTA, S+BIOMETRIKA+1963::A survey of cross-validation procedures for model selection+Arlot, S; Celisse, A.+Stat Surv+2010::Degeneracy in the maximum likelihood estimation of univariate Gaussian mixtures with EM+Biernacki, C; Chretien, S+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 15 2003::Constrained optimization for a subset of the Gaussian parsimonious clustering models+Browne, RP; Subedi, S; McNicholas, P.+arXiv:1306.5824+2013::Inference for multivariate normal mixtures+Chen, Jiahua; Tan, Xianming+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2009::Inference for normal mixtures in mean and variance+Chen, Jiahua; Tan, Xianming; Zhang, Runchu+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2008::Penalized maximum likelihood estimator for normal mixtures+Ciuperca, G; Ridolfi, A; Idier, J+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2003::SOME MATRIX-VARIATE DISTRIBUTION-THEORY - NOTATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND A BAYESIAN APPLICATION+DAWID, AP+BIOMETRIKA+1981::ESTIMATING COMPONENTS OF A MIXTURE OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+DAY, NE+BIOMETRIKA+1969::Bias-Adjusted Three-Step Latent Markov Modeling With Covariates+Di Mari, Roberto; Oberski, Daniel L.; Vermunt, Jeroen K.+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+SEP-OCT 2016::MATRICVARIATE GENERALIZATIONS OF MULTIVARIATE T DISTRIBUTION AND INVERTED MULTIVARIATE T DISTRIBUTION+DICKEY, JM+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1967::Unsupervised learning with normalised data and non-Euclidean norms+Doherty, K.

Clustering of imbalanced high-dimensional media data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-017-0292-z,JUN 2018,25,0,"Media content in large repositories usually exhibits multiple groups of strongly varying sizes. Media of potential interest often form notably smaller groups. Such media groups differ so much from the remaining data that it may be worthy to look at them in more detail. In contrast, media with popular content appear in larger groups. Identifying groups of varying sizes is addressed by clustering of imbalanced data. Clustering highly imbalanced media groups is additionally challenged by the high dimensionality of the underlying features. In this paper, we present the imbalanced clustering (IClust) algorithm designed to reveal group structures in high-dimensional media data. IClust employs an existing clustering method in order to find an initial set of a large number of potentially highly pure clusters which are then successively merged. The main advantage of IClust is that the number of clusters does not have to be pre-specified and that no specific assumptions about the cluster or data characteristics need to be made. Experiments on real-world media data demonstrate that in comparison to existing methods, IClust is able to better identify media groups, especially groups of small sizes.","Clustering,Imbalanced data,High-dimensional data,Media data,LOF",,"Brodinova, Sarka@TU Wien, Inst Software Technol & Interact Syst, Favoritenstr 9-11, A-1040 Vienna, Austria::Zaharieva, Maia@TU Wien, Inst Software Technol & Interact Syst, Favoritenstr 9-11, A-1040 Vienna, Austria@Univ Vienna, Multimedia Informat Syst Grp, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria::Filzmoser, Peter@TU Wien, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, Wiedner Hauptstr 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, Austria::Ortner, Thomas@Univ Vienna, Multimedia Informat Syst Grp, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria@TU Wien, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, Wiedner Hauptstr 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, Austria::Breiteneder, Christian@TU Wien, Inst Software Technol & Interact Syst, Favoritenstr 9-11, A-1040 Vienna, Austria","Brodinova, Sarka@Vienna University of Technology::Zaharieva, Maia@University of Vienna@Vienna University of Technology::Filzmoser, Peter@Vienna University of Technology::Ortner, Thomas@Vienna University of Technology@University of Vienna::Breiteneder, Christian@Vienna University of Technology","Rohm, Maia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5108-6874","Robust partitional clustering by outlier and density insensitive seeding+Al Hasan, Mohammad; Chaoji, Vineet; Salem, Saeed; et al.+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+AUG 1 2009::A k-means based clustering algorithm+Bloisi, Domenico Daniele; Locchi, Luca+COMPUTER VISION SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS+2008::APCluster: an R package for affinity propagation clustering+Bodenhofer, Ulrich; Kothmeier, Andreas; Hochreiter, Sepp+BIOINFORMATICS+SEP 1 2011::LOF: Identifying density-based local outliers+Breunig, MM; Kriegel, HP; Ng, RT; et al.+SIGMOD RECORD+JUN 2000::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::Clustering by passing messages between data points+Frey, Brendan J.; Dueck, Delbert+SCIENCE+FEB 16 2007::A K-means clustering algorithm+Hartigan, J.A.; Wong, M.A.+Applied Statistics+1979::Extended k-means with an efficient estimation of the number of clusters+Ishioka, T.+Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated - IDEAL 2000.

Asymptotic comparison of semi-supervised and supervised linear discriminant functions for heteroscedastic normal populations,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0266-6,JUN 2018,33,0,"It has been reported that using unlabeled data together with labeled data to construct a discriminant function works successfully in practice. However, theoretical studies have implied that unlabeled data can sometimes adversely affect the performance of discriminant functions. Therefore, it is important to know what situations call for the use of unlabeled data. In this paper, asymptotic relative efficiency is presented as the measure for comparing analyses with and without unlabeled data under the heteroscedastic normality assumption. The linear discriminant function maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is considered. Asymptotic relative efficiency is evaluated to investigate when and how unlabeled data contribute to improving discriminant performance under several conditions.

Local generalized quadratic distance metrics: application to the k-nearest neighbors classifier,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-017-0286-x,JUN 2018,45,0,"Finding the set of nearest neighbors for a query point of interest appears in a variety of algorithms for machine learning and pattern recognition. Examples include k nearest neighbor classification, information retrieval, case-based reasoning, manifold learning, and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In this work, we propose a new approach for determining a distance metric from the data for finding such neighboring points. For a query point of interest, our approach learns a generalized quadratic distance (GQD) metric based on the statistical properties in a ""small"" neighborhood for the point of interest. The locally learned GQD metric captures information such as the density, curvature, and the intrinsic dimensionality for the points falling in this particular neighborhood. Unfortunately, learning the GQD parameters under such a local learning mechanism is a challenging problem with a high computational overhead. To address these challenges, we estimate the GQD parameters using the minimum volume covering ellipsoid (MVCE) for a set of points. The advantage of the MVCE is two-fold. First, the MVCE together with the local learning approach approximate the functionality of a well known robust estimator for covariance matrices. Second, computing the MVCE is a convex optimization problem which, in addition to having a unique global solution, can be efficiently solved using a first order optimization algorithm. We validate our metric learning approach on a large variety of datasets and show that the proposed metric has promising results when compared with five algorithms from the literature for supervised metric learning.","Query-based operations,k Nearest neighbors,Distance metric learning,Minimum volume covering ellipsoid,Minimum volume ellipsoid estimator","NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION,ELLIPSOIDS,ALGORITHMS","Abou-Moustafa, Karim@Univ Alberta, Dept Comp Sci, ATH 3-55, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E8, Canada::Ferrie, Frank P.@McGill Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, McConnell Engn Bldg,Room 441,3480 Univ St, Montreal, PQ H3A 2E9, Canada","Abou-Moustafa, Karim@University of Alberta::Ferrie, Frank P.@McGill University",not exist,"A note on metric properties of some divergence measures: The Gaussian case+Abou-Moustafa, K.; Ferrie, F.+P MACH LEARN RES+2012::Learning a metric space for neighborhood topology estimation: Application to manifold learning+Abou-Moustafa, K.

Unsupervised classification of children's bodies using currents,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-017-0283-0,JUN 2018,37,0,"Object classification according to their shape and size is of key importance in many scientific fields. This work focuses on the case where the size and shape of an object is characterized by a current. A current is a mathematical object which has been proved relevant to the modeling of geometrical data, like submanifolds, through integration of vector fields along them. As a consequence of the choice of a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) as a test space for integrating manifolds, it is possible to consider that shapes are embedded in this Hilbert Space. A vector-valued RKHS is a Hilbert space of vector fields; therefore, it is possible to compute a mean of shapes, or to calculate a distance between two manifolds. This embedding enables us to consider size-and-shape clustering algorithms. These algorithms are applied to a 3D database obtained from an anthropometric survey of the Spanish child population with a potential application to online sales of children's wear.","Currents,Statistical shape analysis,Reproducing kernel Hilbert space,Children's body shapes,k-Means","KERNEL HILBERT-SPACES,K-MEANS,SHAPES","Barahona, Sonia@Univ Jaume 1, Dept Math, Avda Riu Sec S-N, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Castellon, Spain::Gual-Arnau, Ximo@Univ Jaume 1, Dept Math INIT, Avda Riu Sec S-N, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Castellon, Spain::Victoria Ibanez, Maria@Univ Jaume 1, Dept Math IMAC, Avda Riu Sec S-N, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Castellon, Spain::Simo, Amelia@Univ Jaume 1, Dept Math IMAC, Avda Riu Sec S-N, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Castellon, Spain","Barahona, Sonia@Universitat Jaume I::Gual-Arnau, Ximo@Universitat Jaume I::Victoria Ibanez, Maria@Universitat Jaume I::Simo, Amelia@Universitat Jaume I","Gual-Arnau, Ximo@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6726-4463","The space of human body shapes: reconstruction and parameterization from range scans+Allen, B; Curless, B; Popovic, Z+ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS+JUL 2003::THEORY OF REPRODUCING KERNELS+ARONSZAJN, N+TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY+1950::Parametric human body shape modeling framework for human-centered product design+Baek, Seung-Yeob; Lee, Kunwoo+COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN+JAN 2012::SOBOLEV METRICS ON SHAPE SPACE OF SURFACES+Bauer, Martin; Harms, Philipp; Michor, Peter W.+JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC MECHANICS+DEC 2011::Clustering methods: a history of k-means algorithms+Bock, HH.+Selected contributions in data analysis and classification.+2007::Universal multi-task kernels+Caponnetto, Andrea; Micchelli, Charles A.; Pontil, Massimiliano; et al.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+JUL 2008::VECTOR VALUED REPRODUCING KERNEL HILBERT SPACES OF INTEGRABLE FUNCTIONS AND MERCER THEOREM+Carmeli, Claudio; De Vito, Ernesto; Toigo, Alessandro+ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS+OCT 2006::The development of sizing systems for Taiwanese elementary- and high-school students+Chung, Meng-Jung; Lin, Hai-Fen; Wang, Mao-Jiun J.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS+AUG 2007::no title+Conway, J.

A semiparametric Bayesian joint model for multiple mixed-type outcomes: an application to acute myocardial infarction,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0273-7,JUN 2018,37,0,"We propose a Bayesian semiparametric regression model to represent mixed-type multiple outcomes concerning patients affected by Acute Myocardial Infarction. Our approach is motivated by data coming from the ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) Archive, a multi-center observational prospective clinical study planned as part of the Strategic Program of Lombardy, Italy. We specifically consider a joint model for a variable measuring treatment time and in-hospital and 60-day survival indicators. One of our main motivations is to understand how the various hospitals differ in terms of the variety of information collected as part of the study. To do so we postulate a semiparametric random effects model that incorporates dependence on a location indicator that is used to explicitly differentiate among hospitals in or outside the city of Milano. The model is based on the two parameter Poisson-Dirichlet prior, also known as the Pitman-Yor process prior. We discuss the resulting posterior inference, including sensitivity analysis, and a comparison with the particular sub-model arising when a Dirichlet process prior is assumed.","Bayesian clustering,Bayesian nonparametrics,Two parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process prior,Random-effects models,Random partition models,Unbalanced binary outcomes","LATENT VARIABLE MODELS,PRIMARY ANGIOPLASTY,REGRESSION-MODELS,DISCRETE,MORTALITY,BINARY,TIME","Guglielmi, Alessandra@Politecn Milan, Dept Math, Via Bonardi 9, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Ieva, Francesca@Univ Milan, ADAMSS Ctr, Via Saldini 50, I-20133 Milan, Italy@Univ Milan, Dept Math F Enriques, Via Saldini 50, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Paganoni, Anna Maria@Politecn Milan, MOX Dept Math, Via Bonardi 9, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Quintana, Fernardo A.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadist, Santiago, Chile","Guglielmi, Alessandra@Polytechnic University of Milan::Ieva, Francesca@University of Milan::Paganoni, Anna Maria@Polytechnic University of Milan::Quintana, Fernardo A.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","Ieva, Francesca@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0165-1983","Relation of time to treatment and mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary coronary angioplasty+Antoniucci, D;

D-trace estimation of a precision matrix using adaptive Lasso penalties,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0272-8,JUN 2018,59,0,"The accurate estimation of a precision matrix plays a crucial role in the current age of high-dimensional data explosion. To deal with this problem, one of the prominent and commonly used techniques is the norm (Lasso) penalization for a given loss function. This approach guarantees the sparsity of the precision matrix estimate for properly selected penalty parameters. However, the norm penalization often fails to control the bias of obtained estimator because of its overestimation behavior. In this paper, we introduce two adaptive extensions of the recently proposed norm penalized D-trace loss minimization method. They aim at reducing the produced bias in the estimator. Extensive numerical results, using both simulated and real datasets, show the advantage of our proposed estimators.","Adaptive thresholding,D-trace loss,Gaussian graphical model,Gene expression data,High-dimensionality","LARGE COVARIANCE MATRICES,VARIABLE SELECTION,ORACLE PROPERTIES,GRAPHICAL LASSO,SHRINKAGE,LIKELIHOOD,MODELS,CONNECTIVITY,REGRESSION","Avagyan, Vahe@Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, 281 S9 Krijgslaan, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, C Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain::Alonso, Andres M.@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, C Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain::Nogales, Francisco J.@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, Av Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain","Avagyan, Vahe@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid@Ghent University::Alonso, Andres M.@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Nogales, Francisco J.@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid",not exist,"no title+Anderson, T.W.+An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+2003::Model selection through sparse maximum likelihood estimation for multivariate Gaussian or binary data+Banerjee, Onureena; El Ghaoui, Laurent; d'Aspremont, Alexandre+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+MAR 2008::Bayesian structure learning in graphical models+Banerjee, Sayantan; Ghosal, Subhashis+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+APR 2015::no title+Bibby, J.M; Kent, J.T; Mardia, K.V.+Multivariate Analysis+1979::Regularized estimation of large covariance matrices+Bickel, Peter J.; Levina, Elizaveta+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2008::ADAPTIVE COVARIANCE MATRIX ESTIMATION THROUGH BLOCK THRESHOLDING+Cai, Tony; Yuan, Ming+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2012::A Constrained l(1) Minimization Approach to Sparse Precision Matrix Estimation+Cai, Tony; Liu, Weidong; Luo, Xi+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2011::Sparse estimation of high-dimensional correlation matrices+Cui, Ying; Leng, Chenlei; Sun, Defeng+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 2016::First-order methods for sparse covariance selection+D'Aspremont, Alexandre; Banerjee, Onureena; El Ghaoui, Laurent+SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS+2008::COVARIANCE SELECTION+DEMPSTER, AP+BIOMETRICS+1972::Penalized Covariance Matrix Estimation Using a Matrix-Logarithm Transformation+Deng, Xinwei; Tsui, Kam-Wah+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2013::Projected subgradient methods for learning sparse Gaussians.+Duchi, J; Gould, S; Koller, D.+arXiv: 1206.3249+2008::OPERATOR NORM CONSISTENT ESTIMATION OF LARGE-DIMENSIONAL SPARSE COVARIANCE MATRICES+El Karoui, Noureddine+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2008::NETWORK EXPLORATION VIA THE ADAPTIVE LASSO AND SCAD PENALTIES+Fan, Jianqing; Feng, Yang; Wu, Yichao+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JUN 2009::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Dominating estimators for minimum-variance portfolios+Frahm, Gabriel; Memmel, Christoph+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 2010::Sparse inverse covariance estimation with the graphical lasso+Friedman, Jerome; Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Robert+BIOSTATISTICS+JUL 2008::Improving Mean Variance Optimization through Sparse Hedging Restrictions+Goto, Shingo; Xu, Yan+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS+DEC 2015::EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATION OF THE MULTIVARIATE NORMAL COVARIANCE-MATRIX+HAFF, LR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1980::Sparse inverse covariance matrix estimation using quadratic approximation+Hsieh, C.; Sustik, M.; Dhillon, I.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Ravikumar, P</span>.+ADV NEURAL INFORM PR+2011::Learning brain connectivity of Alzheimer's disease by sparse inverse covariance estimation+Huang, Shuai; Li, Jing; Sun, Liang; et al.+NEUROIMAGE+APR 15 2010::On the distribution of the largest eigenvalue in principal components analysis+Johnstone, IM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2001::DNA Copy-Number Alterations Underlie Gene Expression Differences between Microsatellite Stable and Unstable Colorectal Cancers+Jorissen, Robert N.; Lipton, Lara; Gibbs, Peter; et al.+CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH+DEC 15 2008::Parameter uncertainty in portfolio selection: Shrinking the inverse covariance matrix+Kourtis, Apostolos; Dotsis, George; Markellos, Raphael N.+JOURNAL OF BANKING &amp; FINANCE+SEP 2012::Clinical course of breast cancer patients with complete pathologic primary tumor and axillary lymph node response to doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy+Kuerer, HM; Newman, LA; Smith, TL; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+FEB 1999::SPARSISTENCY AND RATES OF CONVERGENCE IN LARGE COVARIANCE MATRIX ESTIMATION+Lam, Clifford; Fan, Jianqing+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2009::no title+Lauritzen,, S.

Relating brand confusion to ad similarities and brand strengths through image data analysis and classification,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-017-0282-1,MAR 2018,48,0,"Brand confusion occurs when a consumer is exposed to an advertisement (ad) for brand A but believes that it is for brand B. If more consumers are confused in this direction than in the other one (assuming that an ad for B is for A), this asymmetry is a disadvantage for A. Consequently, the confusion potential and structure of ads has to be checked: A sample of consumers is exposed to a sample of ads. For each ad the consumers have to specify their guess about the advertised brand. Then, the collected data are aggregated and analyzed using, e.g., MDS or two-mode clustering. In this paper we compare this approach to a new one where image data analysis and classification is applied: The confusion potential and structure of ads is related to featurewise distances between ads and-to model asymmetric effects-to the strengths of the advertised brands. A sample application for the German beer market is presented, the results are encouraging.","Brand confusion,Confusion experiment,Image data analysis and classification,Multinomial logit model,Two-mode hierarchical cluster analysis","FEATURES,RETRIEVAL,DISTANCE","Baier, Daniel@Univ Bayreuth, Chair Innovat & Dialogue Mkt, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany::Frost, Sarah@Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Chair Mkt & Innovat Management, Erich Weinert Str 1, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany","Baier, Daniel@University of Bayreuth::Frost, Sarah@Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus",not exist,"Image clustering for marketing purposes+Baier, D; Daniel, I.+Challenges at the interface of data analysis, computer science, and optimization+2012::Image data analysis and classification in marketing+Baier, Daniel; Daniel, Ines; Frost, Sarah; et al.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+DEC 2012::Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF)+Bay, Herbert; Ess, Andreas; Tuytelaars, Tinne; et al.+COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING+JUN 2008::A knowledge-based system for supporting data analysis problems+Bockenholt, I.; Both, M.; Gaul, W.+Decision Support Systems+Dec. 1989::Zur mehrdimensionalen Analyse von Bildinformationen in Anzeigen fur Imagery-Produkte+Bockenholt, I; Gaul, W.+Vierteljahreshefte fur Mediaplanung+1985::MPEG 7 color structure descriptor: For visual information retrieval projectVizIR+Buturovic, A.+Tech. rep+2005::FCTH: fuzzy color and texture histogram - a low level feature for accurate image retrieval+Chatzichristofis, S.A.; Boutalis, Y.S.+2008 Ninth International Workshop on Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services (WIAMIS)+May 2008::CEDD: Color and edge directivity descriptor: A compact descriptor for image indexing and retrieval+Chatzichristofis, Savvas A.; Boutalis, Yiannis S.+COMPUTER VISION SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS+2008::Image feature extraction techniques and their applications for CBIR and biometrics systems+Choras, R S.+International Journal of Biology and Biomedical Engineering+2007::Towards lifestyle segmentation via uploaded images from surveys and social networks+Daniel, I; Baier, D.+INT C INF SYST ICIS+2015::no title+Duda, R.

Hierarchical clustering of asymmetric networks,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-017-0299-5,MAR 2018,44,0,"This paper considers networks where relationships between nodes are represented by directed dissimilarities. The goal is to study methods that, based on the dissimilarity structure, output hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions indexed by a connectivity parameter. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is built around the concept of admissible methods, which are those that abide by the axioms of value-nodes in a network with two nodes are clustered together at the maximum of the two dissimilarities between them-and transformation-when dissimilarities are reduced, the network may become more clustered but not less. Two particular methods, termed reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, are shown to provide upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Furthermore, alternative clustering methodologies and axioms are considered. In particular, modifying the axiom of value such that clustering in two-node networks occurs at the minimum of the two dissimilarities entails the existence of a unique admissible clustering method. Finally, the developed clustering methods are implemented to analyze the internal migration in the United States.","Hierarchical clustering,Asymmetric network,Directed graph,Axiomatic construction,Reciprocal clustering,Nonreciprocal clustering","INTERNAL MIGRATION REGIONS,ALGORITHMS,FRANCE","Carlsson, Gunnar@Stanford Univ, Dept Math, Stanford, CA 94305 USA::Memoli, Facundo@Ohio State Univ, Dept Math, 231 W 18th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@Ohio State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Ribeiro, Alejandro@Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Segarra, Santiago@MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Carlsson, Gunnar@Stanford University::Memoli, Facundo@Ohio State University::Ribeiro, Alejandro@University of Pennsylvania::Segarra, Santiago@Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)",not exist,"Learning spectral clustering+Bach, FR; Jordan, MI+ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 16+2004::Measures of clustering quality: A working set of axioms for clustering+Ben-David, S.; Ackerman, M.+Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems+2008::A sober look at clustering stability+Ben-David, Shai; von Luxburg, Ulrike; Pal, David+LEARNING THEORY, PROCEEDINGS+2006::ASYMMETRIC CLUSTERS OF INTERNAL MIGRATION REGIONS OF FRANCE+BOYD, JP+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS+1980::A Course in Metric Geometry+Burago, D.; Burago, Y.; Ivanov, S.+AMS Graduate Studies in Math+2001::Hierarchical quasi-clustering methods for asymmetric networks+Carlsson, G; Memoli, F; Ribeiro, A<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Segarra, S</span>.+JMLR W&amp; CP: Int Conf Mach Learn+2014::Alternative Axiomatic Constructions for Hierarchical Clustering of Asymmetric Networks+Carlsson, Gunnar; Memoli, Facundo; Ribeiro, Alejandro; et al.+2013 IEEE GLOBAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING (GLOBALSIP)+2013::AXIOMATIC CONSTRUCTION OF HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING IN ASYMMETRIC NETWORKS+Carlsson, Gunnar; Memoli, Facundo; Ribeiro, Alejandro; et al.+2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)+2013::Multiparameter Hierarchical Clustering Methods+Carlsson, Gunnar; Memoli, Facundo+CLASSIFICATION AS A TOOL FOR RESEARCH+2010::Classifying Clustering Schemes+Carlsson, Gunnar; Memoli, Facundo+FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS+APR 2013::Characterization, Stability and Convergence of Hierarchical Clustering Methods+Carlsson, Gunnar; Memoli, Facundo+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+APR 2010::A brief survey of asymmetric MDS and some open problems+Chino, N.+Behaviormetrika+2012::Geometrical structures of some non-distance models for asymmetric MDS+Chino, N.; Shiraiwa, K.+Behaviormetrika+1993::Achieving Single Channel, Full Duplex Wireless Communication+Choi, Jung Il; Jain, Mayank; Srinivasan, Kannan; et al.+MOBICOM 10 &amp; MOBIHOC 10: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE COMPUTING AND NETWORKING AND THE 11TH ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MOBILE AD HOC NETWORKING AND COMPUTING+2010::no title+Chung, F.

In order to fit the imbalances between objects, the model jointly searches for a partition of objects and appropriate weights which are in turn linearly linked to the external variables. The proposal is fitted in a least-squares framework and a decomposition of the fit is derived. An appropriate Alternating Least-Squares algorithm is provided to fit the model to illustrative real and artificial data.","Asymmetric data,Skew-symmetric matrix,Clustering,External information","ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITIES,CLASSIFICATION","Vicari, Donatella@Sapienza Univ Rome, Dipartimento Sci Stat, Pl Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Vicari, Donatella@Sapienza University Rome",not exist,"Shopping behavior and consumer preference for store price format: Why ""large basket"" shoppers prefer EDLP+Bell, DR; Lattin, JM+MARKETING SCIENCE+1998::Asymmetries in multidimensional scaling+Borg, I; Groenen, PJF.+Softstat ' 95+1995::Modern multidimensional scaling+Borg, I.; Groenen, P.

Transitional modeling of experimental longitudinal data with missing values,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0226-6,MAR 2018,32,0,"Longitudinal categorical data are often collected using an experimental design where the interest is in the differential development of the treatment group compared to the control group. Such differential development is often assessed based on average growth curves but can also be based on transitions. For longitudinal multinomial data we describe a transitional methodology for the statistical analysis based on a distance model. Such a distance approach has two advantages compared to a multinomial regression model: (1) sparse data can be handled more efficiently; (2) a graphical representation of the model can be made to enhance interpretation. Within this approach it is possible to jointly model the observations and missing values by adding a new category to the response variable representing the missingness condition. This approach is investigated in a Monte Carlo simulation study. The results show this is a promising way to deal with missing data, although the mechanism is not yet completely understood in all cases. Finally, an empirical example is presented where the advantages of the modeling procedure are highlighted.","Longitudinal data,Missing values,Multinomial data,Multidimensional scaling,Multinomial regression","GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS,POINT DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,TREND VECTOR MODEL,LINEAR-MODELS,REGRESSION,OUTCOMES","de Rooij, Mark@Leiden Univ, Methodol & Stat Unit, Inst Psychol, Leiden, Netherlands","de Rooij, Mark@Leiden University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::A transitional model for longitudinal binary data subject to nonignorable missing data+Albert, PS+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2000::no title+Anderson, DR.+Model Based Inference in the Life Sciences: A Primer on Evidence+2008::no title+Bartolucci, F.; Farcomeni, A.; Pennoni, F.+Latent Markov Models for Longitudinal Data+2013::LOGISTIC-REGRESSION FOR DEPENDENT BINARY OBSERVATIONS+BONNEY, GE+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1987::The cluster bootstrap consistency in generalized estimating equations+Cheng, Guang; Yu, Zhuqing; Huang, Jianhua Z.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAR 2013::An application of the mixed effects trend vector model to asymmetric change data with auxiliary variables+De Rooij, M.+Behaviormetrika+2012::Trend vector models for the analysis of change in continuous time for multiple groups+de Rooij, Mark+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 15 2009::A warning concerning the estimation of multinomial logistic models with correlated responses in SAS+de Rooij, Mark; Worku, Hailemichael M.+COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE+AUG 2012::The Mixed Effects Trend Vector Model+de Rooij, Mark; Schouteden, Martijn+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+2012::Ideal Point Discriminant Analysis Revisited with a Special Emphasis on Visualization+de Rooij, Mark+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2009::Transitional ideal point models for longitudinal multinomial outcomes+de Rooij, Mark+STATISTICAL MODELLING+APR 2011::no title+Diggle, P.; Diggle, P.+Analysis of Longitudinal Data+2002::Review: A gentle introduction to imputation of missing values+Donders, A.

Assessing the asymmetric effects on branch rivalry of Spanish financial sector restructuring,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0186-2,MAR 2018,35,0,"Spanish financial institutions have been heavily affected by the banking crisis that began in 2008. Many of them, especially Spanish savings banks (or Cajas), had to merge with other institutions or had to be rescued. We address the question of up to what point the nature of competition in this sector has changed as a result of the crisis. Although institutions compete in many ways, we concentrate on their presence in the main street through bank branches open to the public (i.e., retail banking competition). Our measure of inter-firm rivalry is based on a geographical proximity measure that we calculate for the years 2008 (before the crisis) and 2012 (the last available data set). The technical approach is based on multidimensional unfolding, a methodology which allows us to graphically represent the asymmetric nature of such rivalry. These maps visualise the salient aspects of the system during the two dates analysed, and can be understood without a detailed technical knowledge.","Strategy,Competitive market structure,Asymmetric competition,Multidimensional unfolding,Bank branches",,"Sagarra, Marti@Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Business Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain::Busing, Frank M.

Parametric classification with soft labels using the evidential EM algorithm: linear discriminant analysis versus logistic regression,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-017-0301-2,DEC 2017,48,0,"Partially supervised learning extends both supervised and unsupervised learning, by considering situations in which only partial information about the response variable is available. In this paper, we consider partially supervised classification and we assume the learning instances to be labeled by Dempster-Shafer mass functions, called soft labels. Linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression are considered as special cases of generative and discriminative parametric models. We show that the evidential EM algorithm can be particularized to fit the parameters in each of these models. We describe experimental results with simulated data sets as well as with two real applications: K-complex detection in sleep EEGs signals and facial expression recognition. These results confirm the interest of using soft labels for classification as compared to potentially erroneous crisp labels, when the true class membership is partially unknown or ill-defined.","Partially supervised learning,Belief functions,Dempster-Shafer theory,Machine learning,Uncertain data,Discriminant analysis,Logistic regression","BELIEF FUNCTIONS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,EXTENSIONS,FUZZY","Quost, Benjamin@Univ Technol Compiegne, Sorbonne Univ, Heudiasyc UMR 7253, CNRS, Compiegne, France::Denoeux, Thierry@Univ Technol Compiegne, Sorbonne Univ, Heudiasyc UMR 7253, CNRS, Compiegne, France@Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Appl Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China::Li, Shoumei@Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Appl Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Quost, Benjamin@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Sorbonne Universite@Universite de Technologie de Compiegne@Picardie Universites::Denoeux, Thierry@Universite de Technologie de Compiegne@Beijing University of Technology@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Sorbonne Universite@Picardie Universites::Li, Shoumei@Beijing University of Technology","Denoeux, Thierry@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0660-5436","Crowd Label Aggregation Under a Belief Function Framework+Abassi, Lina; Boukhris, Imen+KNOWLEDGE SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT, KSEM 2016+2016::Characterization of Experts in Crowdsourcing Platforms+Ben Rjab, Amal; Kharoune, Mouloud; Miklos, Zoltan; et al.+BELIEF FUNCTIONS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS, (BELIEF 2016)+2016::no title+Bishop, C.

Robust scale estimators for fuzzy data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0210-1,DEC 2017,26,1,"Observations distant from the majority or deviating from the general pattern often appear in datasets. Classical estimates such as the sample mean or the sample variance can be substantially affected by these observations (outliers). Even a single outlier can have huge distorting influence. However, when one deals with real-valued data there exist robust measures/estimates of location and scale (dispersion) which reduce the influence of these atypical values and provide approximately the same results as the classical estimates applied to the typical data without outliers. In real-life, data to be analyzed and interpreted are not always precisely defined and they cannot be properly expressed by using a numerical scale of measurement. Frequently, some of these imprecise data could be suitably described and modelled by considering a fuzzy rating scale of measurement. In this paper, several well-known scale (dispersion) estimators in the real-valued case are extended for random fuzzy numbers (i.e., random mechanisms generating fuzzy-valued data), and some of their properties as estimators for dispersion are examined. Furthermore, their robust behaviour is analyzed using two powerful tools, namely, the finite sample breakdown point and the sensitivity curves. Simulations, including empirical bias curves, are performed to complete the study.","Finite sample breakdown point,Empirical bias curves,Fuzzy numbers,Random fuzzy numbers,Robustness,Scale estimation,Sensitivity curves","NUMBER-VALUED DATA,RANDOM-VARIABLES,STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS","de la Rosa de Saa, Sara@Univ Oviedo, Dept Estadist & IO & DM, Oviedo 33007, Spain@Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, A-1040 Vienna, Austria::Asuncion Lubiano, Maria@Univ Oviedo, Dept Estadist & IO & DM, Oviedo 33007, Spain::Sinova, Beatriz@Univ Oviedo, Dept Estadist & IO & DM, Oviedo 33007, Spain::Filzmoser, Peter@Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, A-1040 Vienna, Austria","de la Rosa de Saa, Sara@Vienna University of Technology@University of Oviedo::Asuncion Lubiano, Maria@University of Oviedo::Sinova, Beatriz@University of Oviedo::Filzmoser, Peter@Vienna University of Technology","RG, SMABSS@N-3322-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9944-3861","K-sample tests for equality of variances of random fuzzy sets+Belen Ramos-Guajardo, Ana; Asuncion Lubiano, Maria+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 1 2012::A distance-based statistical analysis of fuzzy number-valued data+Blanco-Fernandez, A.; Casals, M.

A novel method for forecasting time series based on fuzzy logic and visibility graph,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-017-0300-3,DEC 2017,53,22,"Time series attracts much attention for its remarkable forecasting potential. This paper discusses how fuzzy logic improves accuracy when forecasting time series using visibility graph and presents a novel method to make more accurate predictions. In the proposed method, historical data is firstly converted into a visibility graph. Then, the strategy of link prediction is utilized to preliminarily forecast the future data. Eventually, the future data is revised based on fuzzy logic. To demonstrate the performance, the proposed method is applied to forecast Construction Cost Index, Taiwan Stock Index and student enrollments. The results show that fuzzy logic is able to improve the accuracy by designing appropriate fuzzy rules. In addition, through comparison, it is proved that our method has high flexibility and predictability. It is expected that our work will not only make contributions to the theoretical study of time series forecasting, but also be beneficial to practical areas such as economy and engineering by providing more accurate predictions.","Forecasting,Time series,Fuzzy logic,Visibility graph,Link prediction","COMPLEX NETWORKS,LINK PREDICTION,ENROLLMENTS,MODEL,PERIODICITIES,DISTURBANCE,NUMBERS","Zhang, Rong@Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Inst Fundamental & Frontier Sci, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China@Southwest Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China::Ashuri, Baabak@Georgia Inst Technol, Brook Byers Inst Sustainable Syst, Sch Bldg Construct, Econ Sustainable Built Environm ESBE Lab, 280 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 280 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Deng, Yong@Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Inst Fundamental & Frontier Sci, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China@Southwest Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China","Zhang, Rong@Southwest University - China@University of Electronic Science & Technology of China::Ashuri, Baabak@University System of Georgia@Georgia Institute of Technology::Deng, Yong@Southwest University - China@University of Electronic Science & Technology of China",not exist,"Time Series Analysis of ENR Construction Cost Index+Ashuri, Baabak; Lu, Jian+JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE+NOV 2010::no title+Box, G.

Dense traffic flow patterns mining in bi-directional road networks using density based trajectory clustering,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0256-8,SEP 2017,25,1,"Due to the rapid growth of wireless communications and positioning technologies, trajectory data have become increasingly popular, posing great challenges to the researchers of data mining and machine learning community. Trajectory data are obtained using GPS devices that capture the position of an object at specific time intervals. These enormous amounts of data necessitates to explore efficient and effective techniques to extract useful information to solve real world problems. Traffic flow pattern mining is one of the challenging issues for many applications. In a literature significant number of approaches are available to cluster the trajectory data, however the clustering has not been explored for trajectories pattern mining in bi-directional road networks. This paper presents a novel technique for excavating heavy traffic flow patterns in bi-directional road network, i.e. identifying divisions of the roads where the traffic flow is very dense. The proposed technique works in two phases: phase I, finds the clusters of trajectory points based on density of trajectory points; phase II, arranges the clusters in sequence based on spatiotemporal values for each route and directions. These sequences represent the traffic flow patterns. All the routes and sections exceeding a user specified minimum traffic threshold are marked as high dense traffic areas. The experiments are performed on synthetic dataset. The proposed algorithm efficiently and accurately finds the dense traffic in bi-directional roads. Proposed clustering method is compared with the standard k-means clustering algorithm for the performance evaluation.","Data mining,Traffic flow patterns mining,Trajectory patterns,Traffic control,Mobility mining","TIME TRAJECTORIES,MODELS","Mirge, Vaishali@MM Coll Technol, Raipur, Madhya Pradesh, India::Verma, Kesari@Natl Inst Technol, Raipur, Madhya Pradesh, India::Gupta, Shubhrata@Natl Inst Technol, Raipur, Madhya Pradesh, India","Mirge, Vaishali@Unknow::Verma, Kesari@National Institute of Technology Raipur::Gupta, Shubhrata@National Institute of Technology Raipur",not exist,"Mining sequential patterns+Agrawal, R.; Srikant, R.+Proc.

Multivariate and functional classification using depth and distance,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0269-3,SEP 2017,60,3,"We construct classifiers for multivariate and functional data. Our approach is based on a kind of distance between data points and classes. The distance measure needs to be robust to outliers and invariant to linear transformations of the data. For this purpose we can use the bagdistance which is based on halfspace depth. It satisfies most of the properties of a norm but is able to reflect asymmetry when the class is skewed. Alternatively we can compute a measure of outlyingness based on the skew-adjusted projection depth. In either case we propose the DistSpace transform which maps each data point to the vector of its distances to all classes, followed by k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification of the transformed data points. This combines invariance and robustness with the simplicity and wide applicability of kNN. The proposal is compared with other methods in experiments with real and simulated data.","Bagdistance,Projection depth,Skew-adjusted projection depth,Nearest neighbors","HALF-SPACE DEPTH,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE,REGRESSION DEPTH,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,LOCATION DEPTH,DISTRIBUTIONS,COMPUTATION,QUANTILES,BOXPLOT","Hubert, Mia@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Celestijnenlaan 200B, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium::Rousseeuw, Peter@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Celestijnenlaan 200B, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium::Segaert, Pieter@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Celestijnenlaan 200B, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium","Hubert, Mia@KU Leuven::Rousseeuw, Peter@KU Leuven::Segaert, Pieter@KU Leuven","Hubert, Mia@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6398-4850::Segaert, Pieter@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3219-7242","Supervised classification for functional data: A weighted distance approach+Alonso, Andres M.; Casado, David; Romo, Juan+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUL 2012::no title+Bache, Kevin; Lichman, Moshe.+UCI machine learning repository+2013::A robustification of independent component analysis+Brys, G; Hubert, M; Rousseeuw, PJ+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+MAY-JUL 2005::A robust measure of skewness+Brys, G; Hubert, M; Struyf, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2004::no title+Chen, Y.; Keogh, E.; Hu, B.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Begum, N.; Bagnall, A.; Mueen, A.; Batista, G</span>.+The UCR time series classification archive+2015::Comparison between various regression depth methods and the support vector machine to approximate the minimum number of misclassifications+Christmann, A; Fischer, P; Joachims, T+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2002::Measuring overlap in binary regression+Christmann, A; Rousseeuw, PJ+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUL 28 2001::Multivariate Functional Halfspace Depth+Claeskens, Gerda; Hubert, Mia; Slaets, Leen; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2014::The DDG-classifier in the functional setting+Cuesta-Albertos, J.

Constrained clustering with a complex cluster structure,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0254-x,SEP 2017,55,0,"In this contribution we present a novel constrained clustering method, Constrained clustering with a complex cluster structure (C4s), which incorporates equivalence constraints, both positive and negative, as the background information. C4s is capable of discovering groups of arbitrary structure, e.g. with multi-modal distribution, since at the initial stage the equivalence classes of elements generated by the positive constraints are split into smaller parts. This provides a detailed description of elements, which are in positive equivalence relation. In order to enable an automatic detection of the number of groups, the cross-entropy clustering is applied for each partitioning process. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves significantly better results than previous constrained clustering approaches. The advantage of our algorithm increases when we are focusing on finding partitions with complex structure of clusters.","Constrained clustering,Model-based clustering,Mixture of models,Pairwise equivalence constraints,Semi-supervised learning,Cross-entropy clustering","GAUSSIAN MIXTURE-MODELS,PARTITIONS,ALGORITHMS","Smieja, Marek@Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Lojasiewicza 6, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland::Wiercioch, Magdalena@Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Lojasiewicza 6, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland","Smieja, Marek@Jagiellonian University::Wiercioch, Magdalena@Jagiellonian University",not exist,"Contour Detection and Hierarchical Image Segmentation+Arbelaez, Pablo; Maire, Michael; Fowlkes, Charless; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+MAY 2011::Learning distance functions using equivalence relations+Bar-Hillel, A; Hertz, T; Shental, N<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Weinshall, D</span>.+Machine Learning+2003::Semi-supervised clustering by seeding+Basu, S; Banerjee, A; Mooney, RJ.+Machine Learning+2002::Enhancing the selection of a model-based clustering with external categorical variables+Baudry, Jean-Patrick; Cardoso, Margarida; Celeux, Gilles; et al.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+JUN 2015::Model-based clustering of high-dimensional data streams with online mixture of probabilistic PCA+Bellas, Anastasios; Bouveyron, Charles; Cottrell, Marie; et al.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2013::Semi-supervised support vector machines+Bennett, KP; Demiriz, A.+Adv Neural Inform Process Syst+1998::Integrating constraints and metric learning in semi-supervised clustering+Bilenko, M; Basu, S; Mooney, RJ.+Machine Learning+2004::Algorithms for manifold learning+Cayton, L.+Tech Rep+2005::no title+Collingwood, EF; Lohwater, AJ.+The theory of cluster sets+2004::A simulation study to compare robust clustering methods based on mixtures+Coretto, Pietro; Hennig, Christian+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2010::Muscle injury determination by image segmentation+Ding, JJ; Wang, YH; Hu, LL<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Chao, WL; Shau, YW</span>.+Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP), 2011 IEEE+2011::A K-means clustering algorithm+Hartigan, J.A.; Wong, M.A.+Applied Statistics+1979::A Survey of Evolutionary Algorithms for Clustering+Hruschka, Eduardo Raul; Campello, Ricardo J.

Disjoint factor analysis with cross-loadings,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0263-9,SEP 2017,44,0,"Disjoint factor analysis (DFA) is a new latent factor model that we propose here to identify factors that relate to disjoint subsets of variables, thus simplifying the loading matrix structure. Similarly to exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the DFA does not hypothesize prior information on the number of factors and on the relevant relations between variables and factors. In DFA the population variance-covariance structure is hypothesized block diagonal after the proper permutation of variables and estimated by Maximum Likelihood, using an Coordinate Descent type algorithm. Inference on parameters on the number of factors and to confirm the hypothesized simple structure are provided. Properties such as scale equivariance, uniqueness, optimal simplification of loadings are satisfied by DFA. Relevant cross-loadings are also estimated in case they are detected from the best DFA solution. DFA has also the option to constrain a variable to load on a pre-specified factor so that the researcher can assume, a priori, some relations between variables and loadings. A simulation study shows performances of DFA and an application to optimally identify the dimensions of well-being is used to illustrate characteristics of the new methodology. A final discussion concludes the paper.","Exploratory factor analysis,Disjoint factor analysis,Cross-loadings,Sparse loading matrix","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,GENERAL INTELLIGENCE,VARIMAX CRITERION,FORMULATION,ROTATION,MODEL","Vichi, Maurizio@Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Stat Sci, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Vichi, Maurizio@Sapienza University Rome",not exist,"Partial least squares (PLS) regression+Abdi, H.+Encycl.

Multi-objective retinal vessel localization using flower pollination search algorithm with pattern search,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0257-7,SEP 2017,29,1,"This paper presents a multi-objective retinal blood vessels localization approach based on flower pollination search algorithm (FPSA) and pattern search (PS) algorithm. FPSA is a new evolutionary algorithm based on the flower pollination process of flowering plants. The proposed multi-objective fitness function uses the flower pollination search algorithm (FPSA) that searches for the optimal clustering of the given retinal image into compact clusters under some constraints. Pattern search (PS) as local search method is then applied to further enhance the segmentation results using another objective function based on shape features. The proposed approach for retinal blood vessels localization is applied on public database namely DRIVE data set. Results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed approach is comparable with state of the art techniques in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity with many extendable features.","Flower pollination search algorithm,Pattern search,Multi-objective retinal vessel localization,Bio-inspired optimization,Evolutionary computation","FUZZY C-MEANS,SEGMENTATION,IMAGES,OPTIMIZATION,LEVEL","Emary, E.@Cairo Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Giza, Egypt@Sci Res Grp Egypt SRGE, Cairo, Egypt::Zawbaa, Hossam M.@Beni Suef Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, AAA, Bani Suwayf, Egypt@Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Mihail Kogalniceanu 1, Cluj Napoca 400084, Romania::Hassanien, Aboul Ella@Cairo Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Giza, Egypt@Sci Res Grp Egypt SRGE, Cairo, Egypt::Parv, B.@Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Mihail Kogalniceanu 1, Cluj Napoca 400084, Romania","Emary, E.@Cairo University::Zawbaa, Hossam M.@Beni Suef University@Babes Bolyai University from Cluj::Hassanien, Aboul Ella@Cairo University::Parv, B.@Babes Bolyai University from Cluj",not exist,"no title+Bezdek, J.

Benchmarking different clustering algorithms on functional data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0261-y,SEP 2017,14,1,"Theoretical knowledge of clustering functions is still scarce and only few models are available in form of applicable code. In literature, most methods are based on the projection of the functions onto a basis and building fixed or random effects models of the basis coefficients. They involve various parameters, among them number of basis functions, projection dimension, number of iterations etc. They usually work well on the data presented in the articles, but their performance has in most cases not been tested objectively on other data sets, nor against each other. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of several existing methods to cluster functional data. An outline of their theoretic concepts is given and the meaning of their hyperparameters is explained. A simulation study was set up to analyze the parameters' efficiency and sensitivity on different types of data sets, that were registered on regular and on irregular grids. For each method, a linear model of the clustering results was evaluated with different parameter levels as predictors. Later, the methods' performances were compared to each other with the help of a visualization tool, to identify which method works the best on a specific kind of data.","Functional clustering,Benchmarking,Hyperparameters",,"Yassouridis, Christina@Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Appl Stat & Comp, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria::Leisch, Friedrich@Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Appl Stat & Comp, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Yassouridis, Christina@University of Bodenkultur Wien::Leisch, Friedrich@University of Bodenkultur Wien","Leisch, Friedrich@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7278-1983","WAVELET SHRINKAGE APPROACHES TO BASELINE SIGNAL ESTIMATION FROM REPEATED NOISY MEASUREMENTS+Amato, Umberto; Sapatinas, Theofanis+ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS IN STATISTICS+APR 2005::Functional clustering and identifying substructures of longitudinal data+Chiou, Jeng-Min; Li, Pai-Ling+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2007::THE APPROXIMATION OF ONE MATRIX BY ANOTHER OF LOWER RANK+Eckart, Carl; Young, Gale+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1936::A Comparison of Hierarchical Methods for Clustering Functional Data+Ferreira, Laura; Hitchcock, David B.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2009::Wavelet-Based Clustering for Mixed-Effects Functional Models in High Dimension+Giacofci, M.; Lambert-Lacroix, S.; Marot, G.; et al.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2013::no title+Giacofci, M; Lambert-Lacroix, S; Marot, G<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Picard, F</span>.+curvclust: Curve clustering.

A fuzzy neural network based framework to discover user access patterns from web log data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0228-4,SEP 2017,46,2,"Clustering data from web user sessions is extensively applied to extract customer usage behavior to serve customized content to individual users. Due to the human involvement, web usage data usually contain noisy, incomplete and vague information. Neural networks have the capability to extract embedded knowledge in the form of user session clusters from the huge web usage data. Moreover, they provide tolerance against imperfect and noisy data. Fuzzy sets are another popular tool utilized for handling uncertainty and vagueness hidden in the data. In this paper a fuzzy neural clustering network (FNCN) based framework is proposed that makes use of the fuzzy membership concept of fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and the learning rate of a modified self-organizing map (MSOM) neural network model and tries to minimize the weighted sum of the squared error. FNCN is applied to cluster the users' web access data extracted from the web logs of an educational institution's proxy web server. The performance of FNCN is compared with FCM and MSOM based clustering methods using various validity indexes. Our results show that FNCN produces better quality of clusters than FCM and MSOM.","Fuzzy neural clustering,Self organizing map,Web usage analysis,Fuzzy cluster validity",CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM,"Ansari, Zahid A.@PA Coll Engn, Mangaluru 574153, Karnata, India::Sattar, Syed Abdul@Royal Inst Technol & Sci, Hyderabad 501503, Telangana, India::Babu, A.

General location model with factor analyzer covariance matrix structure and its applications,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0258-6,SEP 2017,38,1,"General location model (GLOM) is a well-known model for analyzing mixed data. In GLOM one decomposes the joint distribution of variables into conditional distribution of continuous variables given categorical outcomes and marginal distribution of categorical variables. The first version of GLOM assumes that the covariance matrices of continuous multivariate distributions across cells, which are obtained by different combination of categorical variables, are equal. In this paper, the GLOMs are considered in both cases of equality and unequality of these covariance matrices. Three covariance structures are used across cells: the same factor analyzer, factor analyzer with unequal specific variances matrices (in the general and parsimonious forms) and factor analyzers with common factor loadings. These structures are used for both modeling covariance structure and for reducing the number of parameters. The maximum likelihood estimates of parameters are computed via the EM algorithm. As an application for these models, we investigate the classification of continuous variables within cells. Based on these models, the classification is done for usual as well as for high dimensional data sets. Finally, for showing the applicability of the proposed models for classification, results from analyzing three real data sets are presented.","General location model,Factor analyzer,Common factor loadings,Classification,The EM algorithm","CATEGORICAL VARIABLES,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,EM ALGORITHM,DIMENSION","Amiri, Leila@Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Math Sci, Dept Stat, POB 1983969411, Tehran, Iran::Khazaei, Mojtaba@Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Math Sci, Dept Stat, POB 1983969411, Tehran, Iran::Ganjali, Mojtaba@Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Math Sci, Dept Stat, POB 1983969411, Tehran, Iran","Amiri, Leila@Unknow::Khazaei, Mojtaba@Unknow::Ganjali, Mojtaba@Unknow",not exist,"Age variation in volves (Microtus californicus, M. ochrogaster) and its significance for systematic studies+Airoldi, JP; Hoffmann, RS.+Occasional papers of the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, Lawrence KS+1984::THE GROUPED CONTINUOUS MODEL FOR MULTIVARIATE ORDERED CATEGORICAL VARIABLES AND COVARIATE ADJUSTMENT+ANDERSON, JA; PEMBERTON, JD+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1985::Mixtures of Factor Analyzers with Common Factor Loadings for the Clustering and Visualisation of High-Dimensional Data+BAEK, J.; MCLACHLAN, G.J.+Technical Report NI08018-SCH+2008::Mixtures of Factor Analyzers with Common Factor Loadings: Applications to the Clustering and Visualization of High-Dimensional Data+Baek, Jangsun; McLachlan, Geoffrey J.; Flack, Lloyd K.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2010::Modeling covariance matrices in terms of standard deviations and correlations, with application to shrinkage+Barnard, J; McCulloch, R; Meng, XL+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2000::Latent Variable Models and Factor Analysis: A Unified Approach, 3rd Edition+Bartholomew, D; Knott, M; Moustaki, I+LATENT VARIABLE MODELS AND FACTOR ANALYSIS: A UNIFIED APPROACH, 3RD EDITION+2011::Performance of a general location model with an ignorable missing-data assumption in a multivariate mental health services study+Belin, TR; Hu, MY; Young, AS; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 30 1999::no title+Bishop, YMM; Fienberg, SF; Holland, PW.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis+1975::Model-based clustering, classification, and discriminant analysis of data with mixed type+Browne, Ryan P.; McNicholas, Paul D.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 2012::A mixture of generalized latent variable models for mixed mode and heterogeneous data+Cai, Jing-Heng; Song, Xin-Yuan; Lam, Kwok-Hap; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 1 2011::Classification with discrete and continuous variables via general mixed-data models+de Leon, A.

A new approach for determining the prior probabilities in the classification problem by Bayesian method,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0253-y,SEP 2017,17,1,"In this article, we suggest a new algorithm to identify the prior probabilities for classification problem by Bayesian method. The prior probabilities are determined by combining the information of populations in training set and the new observations through fuzzy clustering method (FCM) instead of using uniform distribution or the ratio of sample or Laplace method as the existing ones. We next combine the determined prior probabilities and the estimated likelihood functions to classify the new object. In practice, calculations are performed by Matlab procedures. The proposed algorithm is tested by the three numerical examples including bench mark and real data sets. The results show that the new approach is reasonable and gives more efficient than existing ones.","Classification,Bayes error,BayesC,Prior probability",DISTRIBUTIONS,"Thao Nguyen-Trang@Ton Duc Thang Univ, Inst Computat Sci, Div Computat Math & Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam@Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Math & Stat, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam::Tai Vo-Van@Can Tho Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Can Tho City, Vietnam",Thao Nguyen-Trang@Ton Duc Thang University::Tai Vo-Van@Can Tho University,"Thao, Nguyen@L-9620-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2635-5371","no title+Bibby, J.M; Kent, J.T; Mardia, K.V.+Multivariate Analysis+1979::Impact of exponent parameter value for the partition matrix on the performance of fuzzy C means Algorithm+Bora, DJ; Gupta, AK.+arXiv:1406.4007 (arXiv preprint)+2014::Efficient implementation of the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms+Cannon, RL; Dave, JV; Bezdek, JC.+Pattern Anal Mach Intell IEEE Trans+1986::On the number of clusters and the fuzziness index for unsupervised FCA application to BOLD fMRI time series+Fadili, MJ; Ruan, S; Bloyet, D; et al.+MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS+MAR 2001::Classification using kernel density estimates: Multiscale analysis and visualization+Ghosh, AK; Chaudhuri, P; Sengupta, D+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2006::A COMPARISON OF NEURAL NETWORK AND FUZZY CLUSTERING-TECHNIQUES IN SEGMENTING MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES OF THE BRAIN+HALL, LO; BENSAID, AM; CLARKE, LP; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS+SEP 1992::THE OVERLAPPING COEFFICIENT AS A MEASURE OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS AND POINT ESTIMATION OF THE OVERLAP OF 2 NORMAL DENSITIES+INMAN, HF; BRADLEY, EL+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1989::no title+Martinez, W.L.; Martinez, A.R.+COMPUTATIONAL STAT H+2007::no title+McLachlan, G.

Exploratory data analysis for interval compositional data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0245-y,JUN 2017,45,1,"Compositional data are considered as data where relative contributions of parts on a whole, conveyed by (log-)ratios between them, are essential for the analysis. In Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA), we are in the framework of interval data when elements are characterized by variables whose values are intervals on representing inherent variability. In this paper, we address the special problem of the analysis of interval compositions, i.e., when the interval data are obtained by the aggregation of compositions. It is assumed that the interval information is represented by the respective midpoints and ranges, and both sources of information are considered as compositions. In this context, we introduce the representation of interval data as three-way data. In the framework of the log-ratio approach from compositional data analysis, it is outlined how interval compositions can be treated in an exploratory context. The goal of the analysis is to represent the compositions by coordinates which are interpretable in terms of the original compositional parts. This is achieved by summarizing all relative information (logratios) about each part into one coordinate from the coordinate system. Based on an example from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), several possibilities for an exploratory data analysis approach for interval compositions are outlined and investigated.","Interval data,Symbolic data analysis,Aitchison geometry on the simplex,Orthonormal coordinates,Outlier detection,Principal component analysis","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,SYMBOLIC DATA-ANALYSIS,TRANSFORMATIONS","Hron, Karel@Palacky Univ, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic::Brito, Paula@Univ Porto, FEP, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal@Univ Porto, LIAAD INESC TEC, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal::Filzmoser, Peter@Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Mathemat Methods Econ, Wiedner Hauptstr 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, Austria","Hron, Karel@Palacky University Olomouc::Brito, Paula@INESC@Universidade do Porto::Filzmoser, Peter@Vienna University of Technology","Brito, Paula@J-6656-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2593-8818","Biplots of compositional data+Aitchison, J; Greenacre, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2002::The role of perturbation in compositional data analysis+Aitchison, J; Ng, KW+STATISTICAL MODELLING+JUL 2005::no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::Estimation of Social Exclusion Indicators from Complex Surveys: The R Package laeken+Alfons, Andreas; Templ, Matthias+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+AUG 2013::From the statistics of data to the statistics of knowledge: Symbolic data analysis+Billard, L; Diday, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2003::Statistical interpretation of species composition+Billheimer, D; Guttorp, P; Fagan, WF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::no title+Bock, Hans Hermann.+Analysis of Symbolic Data: Exploratory Methods for Extracting Statistical Information from Complex Data+2000::Modelling interval data with Normal and Skew-Normal distributions+Brito, Paula; Pedro Duarte Silva, A.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+2012::PARAFAC.

Model-based regression clustering for high-dimensional data: application to functional data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0242-1,JUN 2017,32,0,"Finite mixture regression models are useful for modeling the relationship between response and predictors arising from different subpopulations. In this article, we study high-dimensional predictors and high-dimensional response and propose two procedures to cluster observations according to the link between predictors and the response. To reduce the dimension, we propose to use the Lasso estimator, which takes into account the sparsity and a maximum likelihood estimator penalized by the rank, to take into account the matrix structure. To choose the number of components and the sparsity level, we construct a collection of models, varying those two parameters and we select a model among this collection with a non-asymptotic criterion. We extend these procedures to functional data, where predictors and responses are functions. For this purpose, we use a wavelet-based approach. For each situation, we provide algorithms and apply and evaluate our methods both on simulated and real datasets, to understand how they work in practice.","Model-based clustering,Regression,High-dimension,Functional data","MIXTURE REGRESSION,SELECTION,LASSO","Devijver, Emilie@Univ Paris 11, Inria Select, Bat 425, F-91405 Orsay, France","Devijver, Emilie@Universite Paris Sud - Paris 11@Universite Paris Saclay@Inria@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)",not exist,"ESTIMATING LINEAR RESTRICTIONS ON REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS FOR MULTIVARIATE NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1951::Slope heuristics: overview and implementation+Baudry, Jean-Patrick; Maugis, Cathy; Michel, Bertrand+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAR 2012::Minimal penalties for Gaussian model selection+Birge, Lucien; Massart, Pascal+PROBABILITY THEORY AND RELATED FIELDS+MAY 2007::Statistics for High-Dimensional Data: Methods, Theory and Applications+Buehlmann, Peter; van de Geer, Sara+STATISTICS FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA: METHODS, THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+2011::JOINT VARIABLE AND RANK SELECTION FOR PARSIMONIOUS ESTIMATION OF HIGH-DIMENSIONAL MATRICES+Bunea, Florentina; She, Yiyuan; Wegkamp, Marten H.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2012::GAUSSIAN PARSIMONIOUS CLUSTERING MODELS+CELEUX, G; GOVAERT, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION+MAY 1995::Wavelet-based scalar-on-function finite mixture regression models+Ciarleglio, A; Ogden, T.+Comput Stat Data Anal+2014::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Joint rank and variable selection for parsimonious estimation in high-dimension finite mixture regression model+Devijver, E.+arXiv: 1501.00442+2015::Finite mixture regression: A sparse variable selection by model selection for clustering+Devijver, Emilie+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2015::no title+Ferraty, F.; Vieu, P.+Nonparametric Functional Data Analysis+2006::Clustering for sparsely sampled functional data+Gareth, J; Sugar, C.+J Am Stat Assoc+2003::Low rank multivariate regression+Giraud, Christophe+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2011::COMPARING PARTITIONS+HUBERT, L; ARABIE, P+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1985::Reduced-rank regression for the multivariate linear model+Izenman, A.J.+Journal of Multivariate Analysis+June 1975::Fitting finite mixture models in a regression context+Jones, P.N.; McLachlan, G.J.+Aust.

Mixture models for ordinal responses to account for uncertainty of choice,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0247-9,JUN 2017,41,3,In CUB models the uncertainty of choice is explicitly modelled as a Combination of discrete Uniform and shifted Binomial random variables. The basic concept to model the response as a mixture of a deliberate choice of a response category and an uncertainty component that is represented by a uniform distribution on the response categories is extended to a much wider class of models. The deliberate choice can in particular be determined by classical ordinal response models as the cumulative and adjacent categories model. Then one obtains the traditional and flexible models as special cases when the uncertainty component is irrelevant. It is shown that the effect of explanatory variables is underestimated if the uncertainty component is neglected in a cumulative type mixture model. Visualization tools for the effects of variables are proposed and the modelling strategies are evaluated by use of real data sets. It is demonstrated that the extended class of models frequently yields better fit than classical ordinal response models without an uncertainty component.,"Ordinal responses,Rating analysis,CUP model,CUB model","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,CUB MODELS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,ODDS MODELS,VARIABLES,PREDICTORS","Tutz, Gerhard@Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Schneider, Micha@Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Iannario, Maria@Univ Naples Federico II, Via L Rodino 22, I-80138 Naples, Italy::Piccolo, Domenico@Univ Naples Federico II, Via L Rodino 22, I-80138 Naples, Italy","Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich::Schneider, Micha@University of Munich::Iannario, Maria@University of Naples Federico II::Piccolo, Domenico@University of Naples Federico II",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data+2010::no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical data analysis+2013::A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::REGRESSION AND ORDERED CATEGORICAL VARIABLES+ANDERSON, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1984::THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO FOR MIXTURES OF DENSITIES FROM THE ONE-PARAMETER EXPONENTIAL FAMILY+BOHNING, D;

Logistic biplot for nominal data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0249-7,JUN 2017,30,0,"Classical biplot methods allow for the simultaneous representation of individuals (rows) and variables (columns) of a data matrix. For binary data, logistic biplots have been recently developed. When data are nominal, both classical and binary logistic biplots are not adequate and techniques such as multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), latent trait analysis (LTA) or item response theory (IRT) for nominal items should be used instead. In this paper we extend the binary logistic biplot to nominal data. The resulting method is termed ""nominal logistic biplot""(NLB), although the variables are represented as convex prediction regions rather than vectors. Using the methods from computational geometry, the set of prediction regions is converted to a set of points in such a way that the prediction for each individual is established by its closest ""category point"". Then interpretation is based on distances rather than on projections. We study the geometry of such a representation and construct computational algorithms for the estimation of parameters and the calculation of prediction regions. Nominal logistic biplots extend both MCA and LTA in the sense that they give a graphical representation for LTA similar to the one obtained in MCA.","Biplot,Categorical variables,Logistic responses,Latent traits,Computational geometry,Inverse Voronoi problem","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,REGRESSION,CLASSIFICATION,MATRICES","Cesar Hernandez-Sanchez, Julio@Spanish Stat Off, Plaza Mercado 24, Zamora 49003, Spain::Luis Vicente-Villardon, Jose@Univ Salamanca, Stat Dept, C Alfonso X El Sabio S-N, Salamanca 37007, Spain","Cesar Hernandez-Sanchez, Julio@Unknow::Luis Vicente-Villardon, Jose@University of Salamanca",not exist,"ON THE EXISTENCE OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES IN LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS+ALBERT, A; ANDERSON, JA+BIOMETRIKA+1984::no title+Baker, F.

A sequential distance-based approach for imputing missing data: Forward Imputation,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0243-0,JUN 2017,28,0,"Missing data recurrently affect datasets in almost every field of quantitative research. The subject is vast and complex and has originated a literature rich in very different approaches to the problem. Within an exploratory framework, distance-based methods such as nearest-neighbour imputation (NNI), or procedures involving multivariate data analysis (MVDA) techniques seem to treat the problem properly. In NNI, the metric and the number of donors can be chosen at will. MVDA-based procedures expressly account for variable associations. The new approach proposed here, called Forward Imputation, ideally meets these features. It is designed as a sequential procedure that imputes missing data in a step-by-step process involving subsets of units according to their ""completeness rate"". Two methods within this context are developed for the imputation of quantitative data. One applies NNI with the Mahalanobis distance, the other combines NNI and principal component analysis. Statistical properties of the two methods are discussed, and their performance is assessed, also in comparison with alternative imputation methods. To this purpose, a simulation study in the presence of different data patterns along with an application to real data are carried out, and practical hints for users are also provided.","Iterative PCA,Mahalanobis distance,MCAR missing data,MissForest,Nearest-neighbour imputation,Skew data",SKEW-NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION,"Solaro, Nadia@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy::Barbiero, Alessandro@Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy::Manzi, Giancarlo@Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy::Ferrari, Pier Alda@Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy","Solaro, Nadia@University of Milano-Bicocca::Barbiero, Alessandro@University of Milan::Manzi, Giancarlo@University of Milan::Ferrari, Pier Alda@University of Milan","Ferrari, Pier Alda@L-3534-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7418-8048::Barbiero, Alessandro@K-4503-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5072-5662::Manzi, Giancarlo@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0703-9998","no title+Atkinson, AC; Riani, M; Cerioli, A.+Exploring multivariate data with the forward search+2004::The multivariate skew-normal distribution+Azzalini, A; DallaValle, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::no title+Azzalini, A.+The R package sn: The Skew-Normal and Skew-t distributions (version 1. 3-0)+2015::Random forests+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+OCT 2001::no title+Cox, Trevor F.; Cox, M.A.A.+Multidimensional Scaling+2001::An imputation method for categorical variables with application to nonlinear principal component analysis+Ferrari, Pier Alda; Annoni, Paola; Barbiero, Alessandro; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUL 1 2011::Similarity, Dissimilarity, and Distance Measure+Gower, JC.+ENCY BIOSTATISTICS+2005::no title+Greenacre, MJ.+Theory and applications of correspondence analysis+1984::no title+Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R; Friedman, J.+The Elements of Statistical Learning+2009::no title+Hollander, M.; Wolfe, D.

Backtransformation: a new representation of data processing chains with a scalar decision function,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0229-3,JUN 2017,49,1,"Data processing often transforms a complex signal using a set of different preprocessing algorithms to a single value as the outcome of a final decision function. Still, it is challenging to understand and visualize the interplay between the algorithms performing this transformation. Especially when dimensionality reduction is used, the original data structure (e.g., spatio-temporal information) is hidden from subsequent algorithms. To tackle this problem, we introduce the backtransformation concept suggesting to look at the combination of algorithms as one transformation which maps the original input signal to a single value. Therefore, it takes the derivative of the final decision function and transforms it back through the previous processing steps via backward iteration and the chain rule. The resulting derivative of the composed decision function in the sample of interest represents the complete decision process. Using it for visualizations might improve the understanding of the process. Often, it is possible to construct a feasible processing chain with affine mappings which simplifies the calculation for the backtransformation and the interpretation of the result a lot. In this case, the affine backtransformation provides the complete parameterization of the processing chain. This article introduces the theory, provides implementation guidelines, and presents three application examples.","Affine transformations,Function composition,Processing chain interpretation,Processing chain visualization","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES,PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS,CLASSIFICATION,SEPARATION,SELECTION,TUTORIAL","Krell, Mario Michael@Univ Bremen, Fac Math & Comp Sci 3, Robot Lab, Robert Hooke Str 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany::Straube, Sirko@DFKI Bremen, German Res Ctr Artificial Intelligence, Robot Innovat Ctr, Robert Hooke Str 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Krell, Mario Michael@University of Bremen::Straube, Sirko@Unknow","Krell, Mario Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7823-3336","Principal component analysis+Abdi, Herve; Williams, Lynne J.+WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+JUL-AUG 2010::Feature normalization and likelihood-based similarity measures for image retrieval+Aksoy, S; Haralick, RM+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+APR 2001::How to Explain Individual Classification Decisions+Baehrens, David; Schroeter, Timon; Harmeling, Stefan; et al.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+JUN 2010::Optimizing spatial filters for robust EEG single-trial analysis+Blankertz, Benjamin; Tomioka, Ryota; Lemm, Steven; et al.+IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE+JAN 2008::Single-trial analysis and classification of ERP components - A tutorial+Blankertz, Benjamin; Lemm, Steven; Treder, Matthias; et al.+NEUROIMAGE+MAY 15 2011::LIBSVM: A Library for Support Vector Machines+Chang, Chih-Chung; Lin, Chih-Jen+ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY+2011::no title+Chen, C.; Hardle, W; Unwin, A.+HDB DATA VISUALIZATI+2008::no title+CIRESAN D+PROC CVPR IEEE+2012::no title+Clarke, F.

NMF versus ICA for blind source separation,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0192-4,MAR 2017,76,1,"Blind source separation (BSS) is a problem of recovering source signals from signal mixtures without or very limited information about the sources and the mixing process. From literatures, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and independent component analysis (ICA) seem to be the mainstream techniques for solving the BSS problems. Even though the using of NMF and ICA for BSS is well studied, there is still a lack of works that compare the performances of these techniques. Moreover, the nonuniqueness property of NMF is rarely mentioned even though this property actually can make the reconstructed signals vary significantly, and thus introduces the difficulty on how to choose the representative reconstructions from several possible outcomes.

A uniform framework for the combination of penalties in generalized structured models,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0205-y,MAR 2017,41,2,"Penalized estimation has become an established tool for regularization and model selection in regression models. A variety of penalties with specific features are available and effective algorithms for specific penalties have been proposed. But not much is available to fit models with a combination of different penalties. When modeling the rent data of Munich as in our application, various types of predictors call for a combination of a Ridge, a group Lasso and a Lasso-type penalty within one model. We propose to approximate penalties that are (semi-)norms of scalar linear transformations of the coefficient vector in generalized structured models-such that penalties of various kinds can be combined in one model. The approach is very general such that the Lasso, the fused Lasso, the Ridge, the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty, the elastic net and many more penalties are embedded. The computation is based on conventional penalized iteratively re-weighted least squares algorithms and hence, easy to implement. New penalties can be incorporated quickly. The approach is extended to penalties with vector based arguments. There are several possibilities to choose the penalty parameter(s). A software implementation is available. Some illustrative examples show promising results.","Model selection,Penalties,Generalized linear model (GLM),Structured regression,Ridge,Lasso,Group Lasso,SCAD,Elastic net,Fused Lasso","PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD,VARIABLE SELECTION,ORACLE PROPERTIES,GROUP LASSO,REGRESSION,REGULARIZATION,SPLINES","Oelker, Margret-Ruth@Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Stat, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Tutz, Gerhard@Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Stat, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Oelker, Margret-Ruth@University of Munich::Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich",not exist,"Regularization of wavelet approximations+Antoniadis, A; Fan, JQ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::Simultaneous Factor Selection and Collapsing Levels in ANOVA+Bondell, Howard D.; Reich, Brian J.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2009::Minimizing average risk in regression models+Claeskens, Gerda; Hjort, Nils Lid+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+APR 2008::Deconvolution of pulse trains with the L-0 penalty+de Rooi, Johan; Eilers, Paul+ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA+OCT 31 2011::Optimally sparse representation in general (nonorthogonal) dictionaries via l(1) minimization+Donoho, DL; Elad, M+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+MAR 4 2003::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::no title+Fahrmeir, L.; Tutz, G.+Multivariate statistical modelling based on generalized linear models+2001::Penalized structured additive regression for space-time data: A Bayesian perspective+Fahrmeir, L; Kneib, T; Lang, S+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2004::Dokumentation und Analysen, Landeshauptstadt Munchen, Sozialreferat, Amt fur Wohnen und Migration+Fahrmeir, L; Belitz, C; Biller, C<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Brezger, A; Heim, S; Hennerfeind, A; Jerak, A</span>.+Statistik+2007::Bayesian regularisation in structured additive regression: a unifying perspective on shrinkage, smoothing and predictor selection+Fahrmeir, Ludwig; Kneib, Thomas; Konrath, Susanne+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+APR 2010::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::A STATISTICAL VIEW OF SOME CHEMOMETRICS REGRESSION TOOLS+FRANK, IE; FRIEDMAN, JH+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1993::Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent+Friedman, Jerome; Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Rob+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+FEB 2010::SPARSE MODELING OF CATEGORIAL EXPLANATORY VARIABLES+Gertheiss, Jan; Tutz, Gerhard+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+DEC 2010::Selection of ordinally scaled independent variables with applications to international classification of functioning core sets+Gertheiss, Jan; Hogger, Sara; Oberhauser, Cornelia; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2011::REGULARIZATION AND MODEL SELECTION WITH CATEGORIAL EFFECT MODIFIERS+Gertheiss, Jan; Tutz, Gerhard+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2012::L-1 Penalized Estimation in the Cox Proportional Hazards Model+Goeman, Jelle J.+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+FEB 2010::no title+Hastie, T; Efron, B.+lars: Least Angle Regression, Lasso and Forward Stagewise+2013::RIDGE REGRESSION - BIASED ESTIMATION FOR NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS+HOERL, AE; KENNARD, RW+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::no title+Kneib, T; Heinzl, F; Brezger, A<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Bove, DS; Klein, N</span>.+BayesX: R utilities accompanying the software package BayesX.

Evaluation of the evolution of relationships between topics over time,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0241-2,MAR 2017,29,1,"Topics that attract public attention can originate from current events or developments, might be influenced by situations in the past, and often continue to be of interest in the future. When respective information is made available textually, one possibility of detecting such topics of public importance consists in scrutinizing, e.g., appropriate press articles using-given the continual growth of information-text processing techniques enriched by computer routines which examine present-day textual material, check historical publications, find newly emerging topics, and are able to track topic trends over time. Information clustering based on content-(dis)similarity of the underlying textual material and graph-theoretical considerations to deal with the network of relationships between content-similar topics are described and combined in a new approach.

On visual distances for spectrum-type functional data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0217-7,MAR 2017,31,0,"A functional distance , based on the Hausdorff metric between the function hypographs, is proposed for the space of non-negative real upper semicontinuous functions on a compact interval. The main goal of the paper is to show that the space is particularly suitable in some statistical problems with functional data which involve functions with very wiggly graphs and narrow, sharp peaks. A typical example is given by spectrograms, either obtained by magnetic resonance or by mass spectrometry. On the theoretical side, we show that is a complete, separable locally compact space and that the -convergence of a sequence of functions implies the convergence of the respective maximum values of these functions. The probabilistic and statistical implications of these results are discussed, in particular regarding the consistency of k-NN classifiers for supervised classification problems with functional data in . On the practical side, we provide the results of a small simulation study and check also the performance of our method in two real data problems of supervised classification involving mass spectra.","Supervised classification,Functional data analysis,Hausdorff metric",,"Cholaquidis, A.@Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay::Cuevas, A.@Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ciudad Univ Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain::Fraiman, R.@Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay","Cholaquidis, A.@University of the Republic - Uruguay::Cuevas, A.@Autonomous University of Madrid::Fraiman, R.@University of the Republic - Uruguay","Cuevas, Antonio@D-1371-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7993-0096","On the kernel rule for function classification+Abraham, C.; Biau, G.; Cadre, B.+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 2006::Computing the Hausdorff distance of geometric patterns and shapes+Alt, H; Brass, P; Godau, M<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Knauer, C; Wenk, C</span>.+Discrete and computational geometry+2003::Classification methods with functional data+Baillo, A.; Cuevas, A.; Fraiman, R.+Oxford Handbook of Functional Data Analysis+2011::Supervised Classification for a Family of Gaussian Functional Models+Baillo, Amparo; Cuevas, Antonio; Antonio Cuesta-Albertos, Juan+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2011::Finding cancer signals in mass spectrometry data+Banks, D; Petricoin, E.+Chance+2003::no title+Billingsley,, P.+Convergence of Probability Measures+1968::no title+BOSQ, D.; BLANKE, D.+Inference and Prediction in Large Dimensions+2007::no title+Bosq, D.+Linear processes in function spaces.

Dichotomic lattices and local discretization for Galois lattices,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0225-7,MAR 2017,53,0,"The present paper deals with supervised classification methods based on Galois lattices and decision trees. Such ordered structures require attributes discretization and it is known that, for decision trees, local discretization improves the classification performance compared with global discretization. While most literature on discretization for Galois lattices relies on global discretization, the presented work introduces a new local discretization algorithm for Galois lattices which hinges on a property of some specific lattices that we introduce as dichotomic lattices. Their properties, co-atomicity and -complementarity are proved along with their links with decision trees. Finally, some quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the local discretization are proposed.","Discretization,Galois lattices,Decision trees,Classification",,"Girard, Nathalie@Univ La Rochelle, Lab L3i, La Rochelle, France@Univ Francois Rabelais Tours, LI EA 6300, Tours, France::Bertet, Karell@Univ La Rochelle, Lab L3i, La Rochelle, France::Visani, Muriel@Univ La Rochelle, Lab L3i, La Rochelle, France","Girard, Nathalie@Centre-Val de Loire (ComUE)@Universite de Tours@Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine (ComUE)@Universite de La Rochelle::Bertet, Karell@Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine (ComUE)@Universite de La Rochelle::Visani, Muriel@Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine (ComUE)@Universite de La Rochelle",not exist,"no title+Barbut, M; Monjardet, B.+Ordres et classifications: algebre et combinatoire+1970::Dichotomic Lattices and Decision Tree+Bertet, K.; Visani, M.; Girard, N.+TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL+2009::no title+Birkhoff, G.+Lattice Theory+1967::no title+Birkhoff, G.+Lattice Theory+1940::Calcul pratique du treillis de Galois d'une correspondance+Bordat, J.P.+Math.

Advances in credit scoring: combining performance and interpretation in kernel discriminant analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0213-y,MAR 2017,64,1,"Due to the recent financial turmoil, a discussion in the banking sector about how to accomplish long term success, and how to follow an exhaustive and powerful strategy in credit scoring is being raised up. Recently, the significant theoretical advances in machine learning algorithms have pushed the application of kernel-based classifiers, producing very effective results. Unfortunately, such tools have an inability to provide an explanation, or comprehensible justification, for the solutions they supply. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to model credit scoring data, which exploits, indirectly, the classification power of the kernel machines into an operative field. A reconstruction process of the kernel classifier is performed via linear regression, if all predictors are numerical, or via a general linear model, if some or all predictors are categorical. The loss of performance, due to such approximation, is balanced by better interpretability for the end user, which is able to order, understand and to rank the influence of each category of the variables set in the prediction. An Italian bank case study has been illustrated and discussed; empirical results reveal a promising performance of the introduced strategy.","Credit scoring,Kernel discriminant analysis,DISQUAL,Small and medium enterprises","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES,NEURAL-NETWORKS,RISK,MODELS,INFORMATION,ALGORITHMS,CLASSIFICATION,CLASSIFIERS,NETS","Liberati, Caterina@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy::Camillo, Furio@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy::Saporta, Gilbert@CEDRIC CNAM, Paris, France","Liberati, Caterina@University of Milano-Bicocca::Camillo, Furio@University of Bologna::Saporta, Gilbert@Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM)@heSam Universite","Liberati, Caterina@B-9208-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9910-4018","Neural nets versus conventional techniques in credit scoring in Egyptian banking+Abdou, Hussein; Pointon, John; El-Masry, Ahmed+EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS+OCT 2008::An empirical comparison of conventional techniques, neural networks and the three stage hybrid Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model for credit scoring analysis: The case of Turkish credit card data+Akkoc, Soner+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+OCT 1 2012::Modelling credit risk for SMEs: Evidence from the US market+Altman, Edward I.; Sabato, Gabriele+ABACUS-A JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING FINANCE AND BUSINESS STUDIES+SEP 2007::The value of non-financial information in small and medium-sized enterprise risk management+Altman, Edward I.; Sabato, Gabriele; Wilson, Nicholas+JOURNAL OF CREDIT RISK+SUM 2010::A neural network approach for credit risk evaluation+Angelini, Eliana; di Tollo, Giacomo; Roli, Andrea+QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE+NOV 2008::Choosing bankruptcy predictors using discriminant analysis, logit analysis, and genetic algorithms+Back, B; Laitinen, T; Sere, K<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; van Wezel, M</span>.+P 1 INT M ART INT AC+1996::Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring+Baesens, B; Van Gestel, T; Viaene, S; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY+JUN 2003::Rule extraction from support vector machines A review+Barakat, Nahla; Bradley, Andrew P.+NEUROCOMPUTING+DEC 2010::no title+Basel, I.+A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems+2011::Generalized discriminant analysis using a kernel approach+Baudat, G; Anouar, FE+NEURAL COMPUTATION+OCT 2000::no title+Benzecri, J.

Supervised box clustering,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0233-2,MAR 2017,41,1,"In this work we address a technique for effectively clustering points in specific convex sets, called homogeneous boxes, having sides aligned with the coordinate axes (isothetic condition). The proposed clustering approach is based on homogeneity conditions, not according to some distance measure, and, even if it was originally developed in the context of the logical analysis of data, it is now placed inside the framework of Supervised clustering. First, we introduce the basic concepts in box geometry; then, we consider a generalized clustering algorithm based on a class of graphs, called incompatibility graphs. For supervised classification problems, we consider classifiers based on box sets, and compare the overall performances to the accuracy levels of competing methods for a wide range of real data sets. The results show that the proposed method performs comparably with other supervised learning methods in terms of accuracy.","Supervised clustering,Classification problems,Incompatibility graphs,Homogeneous boxes","LOGICAL ANALYSIS,NUMERICAL DATA,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHMS,POINTS","Spinelli, Vincenzo@Istat Ist Nazl Stat, Via Tuscolana 1788, I-00173 Rome, Italy","Spinelli, Vincenzo@Unknow",not exist,"Supervised clustering+Awasthi, P; Zadeh, RB.+ADV NEURAL INFORM PR+2010::no title+Bache, Kevin; Lichman, Moshe.+UCI machine learning repository+2013::COVERING WITH EUCLIDEAN BOXES+BARANY, I; LEHEL, J+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS+APR 1987::The Maximum Box Problem for moving points in the plane+Bereg, S.; Diaz-Banez, J.

Minimum Class Variance SVM plus for data classification,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0212-z,MAR 2017,22,1,"In this paper, a new Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) type model called Minimum Class Variance SVM+ (MCVSVM+) is presented. Similar to SVM+, the proposed model utilizes the group information in the training data. We show that MCVSVM+ has both the advantages of SVM+ and Minimum Class Variance Support Vector Machine (MCVSVM). That is, MCVSVM+ not only considers class distribution characteristics in its optimization problem but also utilizes the additional information (i.e. group information) hidden in the data, in contrast to SVM+ that takes into consideration only the samples that are in the class boundaries. The experimental results demonstrate the validity and advantage of the new model compared with the standard SVM, SVM+ and MCVSVM.","Support vector machine,SVM,Group information,Class variance",SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES,"Zhu, Wenxin@China Agr Univ, Coll Sci, Beijing 10083, Peoples R China@Tianjin Agr Univ, Dept Basic Sci, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China::Zhong, Ping@China Agr Univ, Coll Sci, Beijing 10083, Peoples R China","Zhu, Wenxin@China Agricultural University@Tianjin Agricultural University::Zhong, Ping@China Agricultural University",not exist,"no title+Cai, F.+Advanced learning approaches based on SVM+ methodology+2011::SVM+ Regression and Multi-Task Learning+Cai, F; Cherkassky, V.+P INT JOINT C NEUR N+2009::Support vector machines experts for time series forecasting+Cao, LJ+NEUROCOMPUTING+APR 2003::Support Vector Machine Regression in Chemometrics, Computing Science and Statistics+DEMIRIZ, A.; BENNETT, K.

Factor probabilistic distance clustering (FPDC): a new clustering method,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0219-5,DEC 2016,62,0,"Factor clustering methods have been developed in recent years thanks to improvements in computational power. These methods perform a linear transformation of data and a clustering of the transformed data, optimizing a common criterion. Probabilistic distance (PD)-clustering is an iterative, distribution free, probabilistic clustering method. Factor PD-clustering (FPDC) is based on PD-clustering and involves a linear transformation of the original variables into a reduced number of orthogonal ones using a common criterion with PD-clustering. This paper demonstrates that Tucker3 decomposition can be used to accomplish this transformation. Factor PD-clustering alternatingly exploits Tucker3 decomposition and PD-clustering on transformed data until convergence is achieved. This method can significantly improve the PD-clustering algorithm performance; large data sets can thus be partitioned into clusters with increasing stability and robustness of the results. Real and simulated data sets are used to compare FPDC with its main competitors, where it performs equally well when clusters are elliptically shaped but outperforms its competitors with non-Gaussian shaped clusters or noisy data.","Factor clustering,Probabilistic distance clustering,Tucker3,k-means","HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA,T-FACTOR ANALYZERS,MIXTURE-MODELS,K-MEANS,DISTRIBUTIONS,CLASSIFICATION,COMPONENTS,NUMBERS","Tortora, Cristina@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON, Canada::Summa, Mireille Gettler@Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, Paris, France::Marino, Marina@Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Sociali, Naples, Italy::Palumbo, Francesco@Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Polit, Naples, Italy","Tortora, Cristina@McMaster University::Summa, Mireille Gettler@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@University of Paris Dauphine::Marino, Marina@University of Naples Federico II::Palumbo, Francesco@University of Naples Federico II",not exist,"The N-way Toolbox for MATLAB+Andersson, CA; Bro, R+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+AUG 14 2000::Extending mixtures of multivariate t-factor analyzers+Andrews, Jeffrey L.; McNicholas, Paul D.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUL 2011::Cluster analysis in marketing research+Arabie, P; Hubert, L.+Advanced methods of marketing research+1994::Probabilistic D-clustering+Ben-Israel, Adi; Iyigun, Cem+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+JUN 2008::NUMERICAL TAXONOMY WITH FUZZY SETS+BEZDEK, JC+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY+1974::On the interface between cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and multidimensional scaling+Bock, HH.+Multivar Stat Model Data Anal+1987::Model-based clustering of high-dimensional data: A review+Bouveyron, Charles; Brunet-Saumard, Camille+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 2014::Simultaneous model-based clustering and visualization in the Fisher discriminative subspace+Bouveyron, Charles; Brunet, Camille+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2012::Linear flaw detection in woven textiles using model-based clustering+Campbell, JG; Fraley, C; Murtagh, F; et al.+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+DEC 1997::K-means clustering in a low-dimensional Euclidean space+Carroll, J.

Human capital estimation in higher education,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0259-5,DEC 2016,91,1,"The concept of human capital (HC) could be defined, from an economical viewpoint, as a stock variable representing the capacity of an individual to produce a sustained flow of income due to its investment in (higher) education and work experience. This paper focuses on the empirical estimation of the graduates' latent variable HC, composed of two principal dimensions, Educational HC and Work Experience HC, within a realistic structural model, allowing causal relationship among endogenous and exogenous indicators, taking into account possible effects of external covariates. New administrative archives and a novel methodological approach are used. The methodology is applied to estimate HC of graduates in several universities of the Milan area in the early stages of their working career. The empirical results confirm the structure of the Italian job market, where investment in HC through higher education plays only a marginal role for explaining the economic performance.","Human capital,Redundancy analysis,Concomitant indicators","REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS,COMPONENT ANALYSIS,PUBLIC-SCHOOLS,SELF-SELECTION,LEAST-SQUARES,LABOR-MARKET,RETURNS,COLLEGE,QUALITY,VARIABLES","Lovaglio, Pietro Giorgio@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, CRISP Interuniv Res Ctr Publ Serv, Milan, Italy::Vacca, Gianmarco@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy::Verzillo, Stefano@Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, CRISP Interuniv Res Ctr Publ Serv, Milan, Italy","Lovaglio, Pietro Giorgio@University of Milano-Bicocca::Vacca, Gianmarco@University of Milano-Bicocca::Verzillo, Stefano@University of Milan","VERZILLO, STEFANO@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1895-8554","Governance and performance of research universities: evidence from Europe and US+Aghion, P; Dewatripont, M; Hoxby, C<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Mas-Colell, A; Sapir, A</span>.+Econ Pol+2009::no title+Aguinis, H.+Regression Analysis for Categorical Moderators+2004::no title+Almalaurea.+Condizione occupazionale dei Laureati+2011::ESTIMATING LINEAR RESTRICTIONS ON REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS FOR MULTIVARIATE NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1951::GRADUATES JOB MOBILITY: A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS+Bacci, S.; Chiandotto, B.; Di Francia, A.; et al.+STATISTICA+2008::no title+Becker, G.S.+Human Capital+1964::Unobserved ability and the return to schooling+Belzil, C; Hansen, J+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2002::Estimating the returns to college quality with multiple proxies for quality+Black, Dan A.; Smith, Jeffrey A.+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JUL 2006::Evaluating the effect of education on earnings: models, methods and results from the National Child Development Survey+Blundell, R; Dearden, L; Sianesi, B+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2005::Graduates and graduate labor markets in the UK and Italy+Boero, G; McKnight, A; Naylor, Smith J.+Working Paper CRENoS+2001::From Multiblock Partial Least Squares to Multiblock Redundancy Analysis.

Quantile composite-based path modeling,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0231-9,DEC 2016,51,1,The paper aims at introducing a quantile approach in the Partial Least Squares path modeling framework. This is a well known composite-based method for the analysis of complex phenomena measurable through a network of relationships among observed and unobserved variables. The proposal intends to enhance potentialities of the Partial Least Squares path models overcoming the classical exploration of average effects. The introduction of Quantile Regression and Correlation in the estimation phases of the model allows highlighting how and if the relationships among observed and unobserved variables change according to the explored quantile of interest. The proposed method is applied to two real datasets in the customer satisfaction measurement and in the sensory analysis framework but it proves to be useful also in other applicative contexts.,"Quantile regression,PLS path modeling,Multi-block data","REGRESSION QUANTILES,PLS REGRESSION,QUALITY,SEM","Davino, Cristina@Univ Macerata, Dept Polit Sci Commun & Int Relat, Piazza Strambi 1, I-62100 Macerata, Italy::Vinzi, Vincenzo Esposito@ESSEC Business Sch, Dept Informat Syst Decis Sci & Stat, 3 Ave Bernard Hirsch,CS 50105, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France","Davino, Cristina@Unknow::Vinzi, Vincenzo Esposito@ESSEC Business School",not exist,"PLS and success factor studies in marketing+Albers, C.+HDB PARTIAL LEAST SQ+2010::SOLUTION OF AN OVERDETERMINED SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS IN L1 NORM [F4]+BARRODALE, I; ROBERTS, FDK+COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM+1974::Benefits of quantile regression for the analysis of customer lifetime value in a contractual setting: An application in financial services+Benoit, Dries F.; Van den Poel, Dirk+EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS+SEP 2009::CHANGES IN THE UNITED-STATES WAGE STRUCTURE 1963-1987 - APPLICATION OF QUANTILE REGRESSION+BUCHINSKY, M+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1994::no title+Cleveland, W.

Exponential family mixed membership models for soft clustering of multivariate data,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification,10.1007/s11634-016-0267-5,DEC 2016,29,0,"For several years, model-based clustering methods have successfully tackled many of the challenges presented by data-analysts. However, as the scope of data analysis has evolved, some problems may be beyond the standard mixture model framework. One such problem is when observations in a dataset come from overlapping clusters, whereby different clusters will possess similar parameters for multiple variables. In this setting, mixed membership models, a soft clustering approach whereby observations are not restricted to single cluster membership, have proved to be an effective tool. In this paper, a method for fitting mixed membership models to data generated by a member of an exponential family is outlined. The method is applied to count data obtained from an ultra running competition, and compared with a standard mixture model approach.","Mixed membership models,Model based clustering,Mixture models,Variational Bayes","LIKELIHOOD,DISABILITY,INFERENCE","White, Arthur@Univ Dublin, Sch Comp Sci & Stat, Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland::Murphy, Thomas Brendan@Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math & Stat, Dublin 4, Ireland@Univ Coll Dublin, Insight Res Ctr, Dublin 4, Ireland","White, Arthur@Trinity College Dublin::Murphy, Thomas Brendan@University College Dublin","Murphy, Thomas Brendan@H-4366-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5668-7046::White, Arthur@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7268-5163","no title+no author+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS F+1965::Discovering latent patterns with hierarchical Bayesian mixed-membership models+Airoldi, EM; Fienberg, SE; Joutard, C<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Love, T</span>.+Data mining patterns: New methods and applications+2007::Discovering latent patterns with hierarchical Bayesian mixed-membership models+Airoldi, EM; Fienberg, SE; Joutard, C<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Love, T</span>.+Technical report+2006::Introduction to mixed membership models and methods+Airoldi, EM; Blei, D; Erosheva, E<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Fienberg, SE</span>.+HDB MIXED MEMBERSHIP+2014::Combining Mixture Components for Clustering+Baudry, Jean-Patrick; Raftery, Adrian E.; Celeux, Gilles; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2010::no title+Beal, M.

The determination of uncertainty levels in robust clustering of subjects with longitudinal observations using the Dirichlet process mixture,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification,10.1007/s11634-016-0262-x,DEC 2016,44,1,In this paper we introduce a new method to the cluster analysis of longitudinal data focusing on the determination of uncertainty levels for cluster memberships. The method uses the Dirichlet-t distribution which notably utilizes the robustness feature of the student-t distribution in the framework of a Bayesian semi-parametric approach together with robust clustering of subjects evaluates the uncertainty level of subjects memberships to their clusters. We let the number of clusters and the uncertainty levels be unknown while fitting Dirichlet process mixture models. Two simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the proposed methodology. The method is applied to cluster a real data set taken from gene expression studies.,"Dirichlet process mixture,Dirichlet-t distribution,Mixed-effects models,Model-based clustering","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,T-FACTOR ANALYZERS,SAMPLING METHODS,INCOMPLETE DATA,EM ALGORITHM,DISTRIBUTIONS,CLASSIFICATION,CONJUGATE,PRIORS","Rikhtehgaran, Reyhaneh@Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Math Sci, Esfahan 8415683111, Iran::Kazemi, Iraj@Univ Isfahan, Dept Stat, Esfahan 81746, Iran","Rikhtehgaran, Reyhaneh@Isfahan University of Technology::Kazemi, Iraj@University of Isfahan",not exist,"Mixtures of modified t-factor analyzers for model-based clustering, classification, and discriminant analysis+Andrews, Jeffrey L.; McNicholas, Paul D.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+APR 2011::Extending mixtures of multivariate t-factor analyzers+Andrews, Jeffrey L.; McNicholas, Paul D.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUL 2011::Mixtures of common t-factor analyzers for clustering high-dimensional microarray data+Baek, Jangsun; McLachlan, Geoffrey J.+BIOINFORMATICS+MAY 1 2011::Mixture of linear mixed models using multivariate t distribution+Bai, Xiuqin; Chen, Kun; Yao, Weixin+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+MAR 3 2016::Bayesian estimation of membership uncertainty in model-based clustering+Chen, Liyuan; Brown, Steven D.+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+MAY 2014::The transcriptional program of sporulation in budding yeast+Chu, S; DeRisi, J; Eisen, M; et al.+SCIENCE+OCT 23 1998::Gibbs sampling for Bayesian non-conjugate and hierarchical models by using auxiliary variables+Damien, P; Wakefield, J; Walker, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::On selecting a prior for the precision parameter of Dirichlet process mixture models+Dorazio, Robert M.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1 2009::ESTIMATING NORMAL MEANS WITH A DIRICHLET PROCESS PRIOR+ESCOBAR, MD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1994::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::Robust Bayesian Graphical Modeling Using Dirichlet t-Distributions+Finegold, Michael; Drton, Mathias+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2014::How many clusters?

An effective strategy for initializing the EM algorithm in finite mixture models,Advances in Data Analysis and Classification,10.1007/s11634-016-0264-8,DEC 2016,37,0,"Finite mixture models represent one of the most popular tools for modeling heterogeneous data. The traditional approach for parameter estimation is based on maximizing the likelihood function. Direct optimization is often troublesome due to the complex likelihood structure. The expectation-maximization algorithm proves to be an effective remedy that alleviates this issue. The solution obtained by this procedure is entirely driven by the choice of starting parameter values. This highlights the importance of an effective initialization strategy. Despite efforts undertaken in this area, there is no uniform winner found and practitioners tend to ignore the issue, often finding misleading or erroneous results. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective tool for initializing the expectation-maximization algorithm in the mixture modeling setting. The idea is based on model averaging and proves to be efficient in detecting correct solutions even in those cases when competitors perform poorly. The utility of the proposed methodology is shown through comprehensive simulation study and applied to a well-known classification dataset with good results.","Finite mixture models,EM algorithm,Initialization,Model averaging,BIC","CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS,SIMULATING DATA,MULTIVARIATE,PERFORMANCE,COMPONENTS","Michael, Semhar@South Dakota State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Brookings, SD 57007 USA::Melnykov, Volodymyr@Univ Alabama, Dept Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Michael, Semhar@Unknow::Melnykov, Volodymyr@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa",not exist,"The multivariate skew-normal distribution+Azzalini, A; DallaValle, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::Combining Mixture Components for Clustering+Baudry, Jean-Patrick; Raftery, Adrian E.; Celeux, Gilles; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2010::Choosing starting values for the EM algorithm for getting the highest likelihood in multivariate Gaussian mixture models+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::Initializing EM using the properties of its trajectories in Gaussian mixtures+Biernacki, C+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+AUG 2004::Model-based clustering of high-dimensional data: A review+Bouveyron, Charles; Brunet-Saumard, Camille+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 2014::MULTIVARIATE STUDY OF VARIATION IN 2 SPECIES OF ROCK CRAB OF GENUS LEPTOGRAPSUS+CAMPBELL, NA; MAHON, RJ+AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY+1974::A comparative study of efficient initialization methods for the &amp;kappa;-means clustering algorithm+Celebi, ME; Kingravi, HA; Vela, PA.+Comput Res Reposit+2012::no title+CELEUX G+COMPUTATIONAL STATIS+1985::EMCluster: EM Algorithm for model-based clustering of finite mixture Gaussian distribution+CHEN, W.-C; MAITRA, R.+EMCLUSTER EM ALGORIT+2015::A simulation study to compare robust clustering methods based on mixtures+Coretto, Pietro; Hennig, Christian+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2010::An empirical comparison of EM, SEM and MCMC performance for problematic Gaussian mixture likelihoods+Dias, JG; Wedel, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+OCT 2004::CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF MULTIVARIATE DATA - EFFICIENCY VS INTERPRETABILITY OF CLASSIFICATIONS+FORGY, EW+BIOMETRICS+1965::no title+FRALEY C+504 U WASH DEP STAT+2006::How many clusters?

Pruning boxes in a box-based classification method,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0193-3,SEP 2016,28,1,"In this work we address an extension of box clustering in supervised classification problems that makes use of optimization problems to refine the results obtained by agglomerative techniques. The central concept of box clustering is that of homogeneous boxes that give rise to overtrained classifiers under some conditions. Thus, we focus our attentions on the issue of pruning out redundant boxes, using the information gleaned from the other boxes generated under the hypothesis that such a choice would identify simpler models with good predictive power. We propose a pruning method based on an integer optimization problem and a family of sub problems derived from the main one.

Marginal and simultaneous predictive classification using stratified graphical models,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0199-5,SEP 2016,32,2,"An inductive probabilistic classification rule must generally obey the principles of Bayesian predictive inference, such that all observed and unobserved stochastic quantities are jointly modeled and the parameter uncertainty is fully acknowledged through the posterior predictive distribution. Several such rules have been recently considered and their asymptotic behavior has been characterized under the assumption that the observed features or variables used for building a classifier are conditionally independent given a simultaneous labeling of both the training samples and those from an unknown origin. Here we extend the theoretical results to predictive classifiers acknowledging feature dependencies either through graphical models or sparser alternatives defined as stratified graphical models. We show through experimentation with both synthetic and real data that the predictive classifiers encoding dependencies have the potential to substantially improve classification accuracy compared with both standard discriminative classifiers and the predictive classifiers based on solely conditionally independent features. In most of our experiments stratified graphical models show an advantage over ordinary graphical models.","Classification,Context-specific independence,Graphical model,Predictive inference","SPEECH RECOGNITION,CLASSIFIERS","Nyman, Henrik@Abo Akad Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Turku, Finland::Xiong, Jie@Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, Helsinki, Finland::Pensar, Johan@Abo Akad Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Turku, Finland::Corander, Jukka@Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, Helsinki, Finland","Nyman, Henrik@Abo Akademi University::Xiong, Jie@University of Helsinki::Pensar, Johan@Abo Akademi University::Corander, Jukka@University of Helsinki",not exist,"no title+Bishop, C.

Semi-supervised model-based clustering with positive and negative constraints,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0200-3,SEP 2016,42,1,"Cluster analysis is a popular technique in statistics and computer science with the objective of grouping similar observations in relatively distinct groups generally known as clusters. Semi-supervised clustering assumes that some additional information about group memberships is available. Under the most frequently considered scenario, labels are known for some portion of data and unavailable for the rest of observations. In this paper, we discuss a general type of semi-supervised clustering defined by so called positive and negative constraints. Under positive constraints, some data points are required to belong to the same cluster. On the contrary, negative constraints specify that particular points must represent different data groups. We outline a general framework for semi-supervised clustering with constraints naturally incorporating the additional information into the EM algorithm traditionally used in mixture modeling and model-based clustering. The developed methodology is illustrated on synthetic and classification datasets. A dendrochronology application is considered and thoroughly discussed.","Semi-supervised clustering,Model-based clustering,Finite mixture models,Positive and negative constraints,BIC","SIMULATING DATA,MIXTURE-MODELS,CLASSIFICATION,MULTIVARIATE,PERFORMANCE,ALGORITHMS,EM","Melnykov, Volodymyr@Univ Alabama, Dept Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA::Melnykov, Igor@Colorado State Univ, Dept Math & Phys, Pueblo, CO 81001 USA::Michael, Semhar@Univ Alabama, Dept Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Melnykov, Volodymyr@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa::Melnykov, Igor@Colorado State University::Michael, Semhar@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa",not exist,"The Irises of the Gaspe Peninsula.+Anderson, E.+Bulletin of the American Iris society+1935::A probabilistic framework for semi -supervised clustering+Basu, S.; Bilenko, M.; Mooney, RJ.+P 10 ACM SIGKDD INT+2004::Semi-Supervised Clusering by Seeding+Basu, S.; Banerjee, A.; Moorey, R.+P 19 INT C MACH LEAR+2002::Constrained Clustering Advances in Algorithms, Theory, and Applications Introduction+Basu, Sugato; Davidson, Ian; Wagstaff, Kiri L.+CONSTRAINED CLUSTERING: ADVANCES IN ALGORITHMS, THEORY, AND APPLICATIONS+2009::Model-based clustering of high-dimensional data: A review+Bouveyron, Charles; Brunet-Saumard, Camille+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 2014::Locating the origins of wood resources: a review of dendroprovenancing+Bridge, Martin+JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2012::MULTIVARIATE STUDY OF VARIATION IN 2 SPECIES OF ROCK CRAB OF GENUS LEPTOGRAPSUS+CAMPBELL, NA; MAHON, RJ+AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY+1974::Model-Based Clustering of Regression Time Series Data via APECM-An AECM Algorithm Sung to an Even Faster Beat+Chen, W.-C.; Maitra, R.+Statistical Analysis and Data Mining+2011::Learning from partially supervised data using mixture models and belief functions+Come, E.; Oukhellou, L.; Denoeux, T.; et al.+PATTERN RECOGNITION+MAR 2009::A simulation study to compare robust clustering methods based on mixtures+Coretto, Pietro; Hennig, Christian+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2010::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::SPEAKER ADAPTATION USING CONSTRAINED ESTIMATION OF GAUSSIAN MIXTURES+DIGALAKIS, VV; RTISCHEV, D; NEUMEYER, LG+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING+SEP 1995::The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems+Fisher, RA+ANNALS OF EUGENICS+SEP 1936::CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF MULTIVARIATE DATA - EFFICIENCY VS INTERPRETABILITY OF CLASSIFICATIONS+FORGY, EW+BIOMETRICS+1965::no title+FRALEY C+504 U WASH DEP STAT+2006::How many clusters?

The forward search interactive outlier detection in cointegrated VAR analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0216-8,SEP 2016,17,4,"Cointegration analysis is particularly sensitive to outlying observations. Traditional robust approaches rely on parameter estimates based on weighting schemes to penalize aberrant units. This, in particular, is the idea underlying pseudo maximum likelihood robust estimators. Atypical observations, however, can reveal useful information about the investigated phenomenon. Aiming to detect these observations, we extend the forward search procedure to the cointegrated vector autoregressive model. The analysis is carried out by building up subsets of increasing dimension and monitoring suitable statistics at each subset size. Simulation experiments and real data analysis highlight that our forward search is more effective than the pseudo maximum likelihood in detecting atypical units and data structures.","Confidence threshold,Data structure detection,Forward search,Outliers,Pseudo maximum likelihood weights,Robust statistics,Vector equilibrium correction model","TESTS,VECTORS","Bellini, Tiziano@Univ Parma, Parma, Italy","Bellini, Tiziano@University of Parma",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, AC; Riani, M; Cerioli, A.+Exploring multivariate data with the forward search+2004::Distribution tbeory and simulations for tests of outliers in regression+Atkinson, AC; Riani, M+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2006::Robust analysis of default intensity+Bellini, Tiziano; Riani, Marco+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 2012::LONG-RUN RELATIONS IN EUROPEAN ELECTRICITY PRICES+Bosco, Bruno; Parisio, Lucia; Pelagatti, Matteo; et al.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+AUG 2010::no title+CAMPBELL JY+NBER MACROECON ANN+1991::Outlier detection in cointegration analysis+Franses, PH; Lucas, A+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 1998::THE EFFECTS OF ADDITIVE OUTLIERS ON TESTS FOR UNIT ROOTS AND COINTEGRATION+FRANSES, PH; HALDRUP, N+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 1994::Outlier robust analysis of long-run marketing effects for weekly scanning data+Franses, PH; Kloek, T; Lucas, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR-APR 1999::Analysis of the forward search using some new results for martingales and empirical processes+Johansen, S; Nielsen, B.+Bernoulli J+2015::ESTIMATION AND HYPOTHESIS-TESTING OF COINTEGRATION VECTORS IN GAUSSIAN VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS+JOHANSEN, S+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1991::Cointegration analysis in the presence of structural breaks in the deterministic trend+Johansen, S.; Mosconi, R.; Nielsen, B.+Econometrics Journal+2000::STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF COINTEGRATION VECTORS+JOHANSEN, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+JUN-SEP 1988::Discussion: The forward search: Theory and data analysis+Johansen, Soren; Nielsen, Bent+JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN STATISTICAL SOCIETY+JUN 2010::Cointegration testing using pseudolikelihood ratio tests+Lucas, A+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+APR 1997::AN OUTLIER ROBUST UNIT-ROOT TEST WITH AN APPLICATION TO THE EXTENDED NELSON-PLOSSER DATA+LUCAS, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR-APR 1995::no title+NIELSEN HB+ECONOMET J+2004::Finding an unknown number of multivariate outliers+Riani, Marco; Atkinson, Anthony C.; Cerioli, Andrea+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2009"
Quantile regression with group lasso for classification,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0206-x,SEP 2016,42,2,"Applications of regression models for binary response are very common and models specific to these problems are widely used. Quantile regression for binary response data has recently attracted attention and regularized quantile regression methods have been proposed for high dimensional problems. When the predictors have a natural group structure, such as in the case of categorical predictors converted into dummy variables, then a group lasso penalty is used in regularized methods. In this paper, we present a Bayesian Gibbs sampling procedure to estimate the parameters of a quantile regression model under a group lasso penalty for classification problems with a binary response. Simulated and real data show a good performance of the proposed method in comparison to mean-based approaches and to quantile-based approaches which do not exploit the group structure of the predictors.","Quantile regression,Binary regression,Regularized regression,Gibbs sampling","VARIABLE SELECTION,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,MODEL SELECTION,ADAPTIVE LASSO,GROUP SPARSITY,BINARY","Hashem, Hussein@Brunel Univ London, Dept Math, London, England::Vinciotti, Veronica@Brunel Univ London, Dept Math, London, England::Alhamzawi, Rahim@Univ Al Qadisiyah, Coll Arts, Al Diwaniyah, Iraq::Yu, Keming@Brunel Univ London, Dept Math, London, England","Hashem, Hussein@Brunel University::Vinciotti, Veronica@Brunel University::Alhamzawi, Rahim@University of Al-Qadisiyah::Yu, Keming@Brunel University","Vinciotti, Veronica@A-7703-2008::Alhamzawi, Rahim@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1912-9579","Conjugate priors and variable selection for Bayesian quantile regression+Alhamzawi, Rahim; Yu, Keming+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 2013::Bayesian adaptive Lasso quantile regression+Alhamzawi, Rahim; Yu, Keming; Benoit, Dries F.+STATISTICAL MODELLING+JUN 2012::SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::Consistency of the group Lasso and multiple kernel learning+Bach, Francis R.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+JUN 2008::Gene selection using a two-level hierarchical Bayesian model+Bae, K; Mallick, BK+BIOINFORMATICS+DEC 12 2004::l(1)-PENALIZED QUANTILE REGRESSION IN HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SPARSE MODELS+Belloni, Alexandre; Chernozhukov, Victor+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2011::Binary quantile regression: a Bayesian approach based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution+Benoit, Dries F.; Van den Poel, Dirk+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+NOV-DEC 2012::Group descent algorithms for nonconvex penalized linear and logistic regression models with grouped predictors+Breheny, Patrick; Huang, Jian+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAR 2015::Quantile Regression: Theory and Applications+Davino, C; Furno, M; Vistocco, D+QUANTILE REGRESSION: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+2014::Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent+Friedman, Jerome; Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Rob+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+FEB 2010::Large-scale Bayesian logistic regression for text categorization+Genkin, Alexander; Lewis, David D.; Madigan, David+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2007::Quantile regression for longitudinal data using the asymmetric Laplace distribution+Geraci, Marco; Bottai, Matteo+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2007::Simulation-based Regularized Logistic Regression+Gramacy, Robert B.; Polson, Nicholas G.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2012::Local versus global models for classification problems: Fitting models where it matters+Hand, DJ; Vinciotti, V+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2003::THE BENEFIT OF GROUP SPARSITY+Huang, Junzhou; Zhang, Tong+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2010::Model selection in binary and tobit quantile regression using the Gibbs sampler+Ji, Yonggang; Lin, Nan; Zhang, Baoxue+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 1 2012::REGRESSION QUANTILES+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1978::no title+Koenker, R.+Quantile regression+2005::Smoothed binary regression quantiles+Kordas, G+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+APR 2006::Credit scoring using binary quantile regression+Kordas, G.+Statistical data analysis based on the L1-norm and related methods.

Clustering of time series using quantile autocovariances,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0208-8,SEP 2016,46,1,"Time series clustering is an active research topic with applications in many fields. Unlike conventional clustering on multivariate data, time series often change over time so that the similarity concept between objects must take into account the dynamic of the series. In this paper, a distance measure aimed to compare quantile autocovariance functions is proposed to perform clustering of time series. Quantile autocovariances provide information about the serial dependence structure at different pairs of quantile levels, require no moment condition and allow to identify dependence features that covariance-based methods are unable to detect. Results from an extensive simulation study show that the proposed metric outperforms or is highly competitive with a range of dissimilarities reported in the literature, particularly exhibiting high capability to cluster time series generated from a broad range of dependence models. Estimation of the optimal number of clusters is also addressed. For illustrative purposes, our methodology is applied to a real dataset involving financial time series.","Dissimilarity between time series,Clustering,Quantile autocovariances,Optimal number of clusters","SAMPLE AUTOCORRELATIONS,DATA SET,CLASSIFICATION,DEPENDENCE,NUMBER","Lafuente-Rego, Borja@Univ A Coruna, Fac Comp Sci, Dept Math, Res Grp Modeling Optimizat & Stat Inference MODES, La Coruna 15071, Spain::Vilar, Jose A.@Univ A Coruna, Fac Comp Sci, Dept Math, Res Grp Modeling Optimizat & Stat Inference MODES, La Coruna 15071, Spain","Lafuente-Rego, Borja@Universidade da Coruna::Vilar, Jose A.@Universidade da Coruna",not exist,"Special issue on Time series clustering+[Anonymous].+Advances in Data Analysis and Classification+2011::A periodogram-based metric for time series classification+Caiado, Jorge; Crato, Nuno; Pena, Daniel+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 20 2006::A dendrite method for cluster analysis+Calihski, T.; Harabasz, J.+Communications in Statistics-theory and Methods+1974::Computational issues for quantile regression+Chen, C; Wei, Y.+Sankhya: The Indian Journal of Statistics+2005::Time series clustering and classification by the autoregressive metric+Corduas, Marcella; Piccolo, Domenico+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 10 2008::Autocorrelation-based fuzzy clustering of time series+D'Urso, Pierpaolo; Maharaj, Elizabeth Ann+FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS+DEC 16 2009::Clustering of financial time series+D'Urso, Pierpaolo; Cappelli, Carmela; Di Lallo, Dario; et al.+PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS+MAY 1 2013::The sample autocorrelations of heavy-tailed processes with applications to arch+Davis, RA; Mikosch, T+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 1998::The extremogram: A correlogram for extreme events+Davis, Richard A.; Mikosch, Thomas+BERNOULLI+NOV 2009::A tail dependence-based dissimilarity measure for financial time series clustering+De Luca, Giovanni; Zuccolotto, Paola+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+DEC 2011::Of copulas, quantiles, ranks and spectra: an l&lt;INF&gt;1&lt;/INF&gt;-approach to spectral analysis+Dette, H.; Hallin, M.; Kley, T.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Volgushev, S</span>.+Arxiv e-prints, arXiv:1111.7205v2+2014::A prediction-based resampling method for estimating the number of clusters in a dataset+Dudoit, Sandrine; Fridlyand, Jane+GENOME BIOLOGY+2002::Panel data analysis: a survey on model-based clustering of time series+Fruehwirth-Schnatter, Sylvia+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+DEC 2011::Model-based clustering of multiple time series+Fruehwirth-Schnatter, Sylvia; Kaufmann, Sylvia+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2008::A review on time series data mining+Fu, Tak-chung+ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE+FEB 2011::Mining the stock market: which measure is best?+Gavrilov, M.; Anguelov, D.; Indyk, P.; et al.+Proceedings.

According to the standard mixture model, called CUB model, the response probabilities are defined as a convex combination of shifted Binomial and discrete Uniform random variables. Our proposal introduces uncertainty distributions with different shapes, which could capture response style and indecision of respondents with greater effectiveness. Since we consider several alternative specifications that are nonnested, we suggest the implementation of a Vuong test for choosing among them. In this regard, some simulation experiments and real case studies confirm the usefulness of the approach.","Ordinal data,CUB models,Latent classification,Mixture","RESPONSE STYLES,ORDINAL DATA,HYPOTHESES,TESTS","Gottard, Anna@Univ Florence, Dept Stat Comp Sci Applicat G Parenti, Vle Morgagni 59, I-50134 Florence, Italy::Iannario, Maria@Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Via Leopoldo Rodino 22, I-80138 Naples, Italy::Piccolo, Domenico@Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Via Leopoldo Rodino 22, I-80138 Naples, Italy","Gottard, Anna@University of Florence::Iannario, Maria@University of Naples Federico II::Piccolo, Domenico@University of Naples Federico II",not exist,"no title+AGRESTI, ALAN.+Analysis of ordinal categorical data+2010::METHOD FOR DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN MODELS+ATKINSON, AC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1970::Response styles in marketing research: A cross-national investigation+Baumgartner, H; Steenkamp, JBEM+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+MAY 2001::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Cross-national response styles in international educational assessments: Evidence from PISA 2006+Buckley, J.+Technical Report+2009::no title+Cliff, Norman; Keats, John A.+Ordinal Measurement in the Behavioral Sciences+2003::A class of statistical models for evaluating services and performances+Corduas, Marcella; Iannario, Maria; Piccolo, Domenico+STATISTICAL METHODS FOR THE EVALUATION OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS+2009::Tests of separate families of hypotheses+Cox, D.+P 4 BERK S MATH STAT+1961::A return to an old paper: ""Tests of separate families of hypotheses'+Cox, D.

Micro-macro multilevel latent class models with multiple discrete individual-level variables,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0234-1,JUN 2016,21,3,"An existing micro-macro method for a single individual-level variable is extended to the multivariate situation by presenting two multilevel latent class models in which multiple discrete individual-level variables are used to explain a group-level outcome. As in the univariate case, the individual-level data are summarized at the group-level by constructing a discrete latent variable at the group level and this group-level latent variable is used as a predictor for the group-level outcome. In the first extension, that is referred to as the Direct model, the multiple individual-level variables are directly used as indicators for the group-level latent variable. In the second extension, referred to as the Indirect model, the multiple individual-level variables are used to construct an individual-level latent variable that is used as an indicator for the group-level latent variable. This implies that the individual-level variables are used indirectly at the group-level. The within- and between components of the (co)varn the individual-level variables are independent in the Direct model, but dependent in the Indirect model. Both models are discussed and illustrated with an empirical data example.","Latent class analysis,Micro-macro analysis,Multilevel analysis,Discrete data",OUTCOME VARIABLES,"Bennink, Margot@Tilburg Univ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands::Croon, Marcel A.@Tilburg Univ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands::Kroon, Brigitte@Tilburg Univ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands::Vermunt, Jeroen K.@Tilburg Univ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","Bennink, Margot@Tilburg University::Croon, Marcel A.@Tilburg University::Kroon, Brigitte@Tilburg University::Vermunt, Jeroen K.@Tilburg University","vermunt, jeroen@K-3680-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9053-9330","ESTIMATING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LATENT CLASS MEMBERSHIP AND EXTERNAL VARIABLES USING BIAS-ADJUSTED THREE-STEP APPROACHES+Bakk, Zsuzsa; Tekle, Fetene B.; Vermunt, Jeroen K.+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 2013, VOL 43+2013::no title+no author+Historical database of survey of household income and wealth+2012::Micro-Macro Multilevel Analysis for Discrete Data: A Latent Variable Approach and an Application on Personal Network Data+Bennink, Margot; Croon, Marcel A.; Vermunt, Jeroen K.+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+NOV 2013::Estimating latent structure models with categorical variables: One-step versus three-step estimators+Bolck, A; Croon, M; Hagenaars, J+POLITICAL ANALYSIS+WIN 2004::Predicting group-level outcome variables from variables measured at the individual level: A latent variable multilevel model+Croon, Marcel A.; van Veldhoven, Marc J.

Model based clustering for mixed data: clustMD,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0238-x,JUN 2016,40,6,"A model based clustering procedure for data of mixed type, clustMD, is developed using a latent variable model. It is proposed that a latent variable, following a mixture of Gaussian distributions, generates the observed data of mixed type. The observed data may be any combination of continuous, binary, ordinal or nominal variables. clustMD employs a parsimonious covariance structure for the latent variables, leading to a suite of six clustering models that vary in complexity and provide an elegant and unified approach to clustering mixed data. An expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm is used to estimate clustMD; in the presence of nominal data a Monte Carlo EM algorithm is required. The clustMD model is illustrated by clustering simulated mixed type data and prostate cancer patients, on whom mixed data have been recorded.","Latent variables,Mixture model,Mixed data,Monte Carlo EM","LATENT VARIABLE MODELS,EM ALGORITHM,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,MIXTURE MODEL","McParland, Damien@Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math & Stat, Dublin 2, Ireland::Gormley, Isobel Claire@Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math & Stat, Dublin 2, Ireland@Univ Coll Dublin, INSIGHT, Dublin 2, Ireland","McParland, Damien@University College Dublin::Gormley, Isobel Claire@University College Dublin",not exist,"no title+Andrews, D.

Beyond the number of classes: separating substantive from non-substantive dependence in latent class analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0211-0,JUN 2016,40,6,"Latent class analysis (LCA) for categorical data is a model-based clustering and classification technique applied in a wide range of fields including the social sciences, machine learning, psychiatry, public health, and epidemiology. Its central assumption is conditional independence of the indicators given the latent class, i.e. ""local independence""; violations can appear as model misfit, often leading LCA practitioners to increase the number of classes. However, when not all of the local dependence is of substantive scientific interest this leads to two options, that are both problematic: modeling uninterpretable classes, or retaining a lower number of substantive classes but incurring bias in the final results and classifications of interest due to remaining assumption violations. This paper suggests an alternative procedure, applicable in cases when the number of substantive classes is known in advance, or when substantive interest is otherwise well-defined. I suggest, in such cases, to model substantive local dependencies as additional discrete latent variables, while absorbing nuisance dependencies in additional parameters. An example application to the estimation of misclassification and turnover rates of the decision to vote in elections of 9510 Dutch residents demonstrates the advantages of this procedure relative to increasing the number of classes.","Latent class analysis,Local dependence,Bivariate residual,Score test,Information criteria,Vote misclassification","DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS,CATEGORICAL-DATA,STRUCTURE MODELS,VARIABLES","Oberski, D.

Latent class model with conditional dependency per modes to cluster categorical data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0250-1,JUN 2016,30,0,"We propose a parsimonious extension of the classical latent class model to cluster categorical data by relaxing the conditional independence assumption. Under this new mixture model, named conditional modes model (CMM), variables are grouped into conditionally independent blocks. Each block follows a parsimonious multinomial distribution where the few free parameters model the probabilities of the most likely levels, while the remaining probability mass is uniformly spread over the other levels of the block. Thus, when the conditional independence assumption holds, this model defines parsimonious versions of the standard latent class model. Moreover, when this assumption is violated, the proposed model brings out the main intra-class dependencies between variables, summarizing thus each class with relatively few characteristic levels. The model selection is carried out by an hybrid MCMC algorithm that does not require preliminary parameter estimation. Then, the maximum likelihood estimation is performed via an EM algorithm only for the best model. The model properties are illustrated on simulated data and on three real data sets by using the associated R package CoModes. The results show that this model allows to reduce biases involved by the conditional independence assumption while providing meaningful parameters.","Categorical data,Clustering,Integrated complete-data likelihood,MCMC algorithm,Mixture models,Model selection",TESTS,"Marbac, Matthieu@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON, Canada::Biernacki, Christophe@Univ Lille 1, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France@Univ Lille 1, Ctr Hyperfrequences & Semicond, CNRS, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France@Inria Lille, Villeneuve Dascq, France::Vandewalle, Vincent@Univ Lille 2, EA 2694, Lille, France@Inria Lille, Lille, France","Marbac, Matthieu@McMaster University::Biernacki, Christophe@Universite Lille-Nord-de-France (ComUE)@Fondation I-SITE ULNE@Universite de Lille@Inria@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Vandewalle, Vincent@Fondation I-SITE ULNE@Universite Lille-Nord-de-France (ComUE)@Universite de Lille@Inria","Christophe, Biernacki@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8995-0568","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::IDENTIFIABILITY OF PARAMETERS IN LATENT STRUCTURE MODELS WITH MANY OBSERVED VARIABLES+Allman, Elizabeth S.; Matias, Catherine; Rhode, John A.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2009::Latent Variable Models and Factor Analysis: A Unified Approach, 3rd Edition+Bartholomew, D; Knott, M; Moustaki, I+LATENT VARIABLE MODELS AND FACTOR ANALYSIS: A UNIFIED APPROACH, 3RD EDITION+2011::Exact and Monte Carlo calculations of integrated likelihoods for the latent class model+Biernacki, C.; Celeux, G.; Govaert, G.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 2010::no title+BRETAGNOLLE, V.+Personal communication. source: Museum+2007::CLUSTERING CRITERIA FOR DISCRETE-DATA AND LATENT CLASS MODELS+CELEUX, G; GOVAERT, G+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1991::A partitioning method for the clustering of categorical variables+Chavent, M; Kuentz, V; Saracco, J.+Classification as a tool for research+2010::Estimation in Discrete Parameter Models+Choirat, Christine; Seri, Raffaello+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2012::Application of rough sets in the presumptive diagnosis of urinary system diseases+Czerniak, J; Zarzycki, H+ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS+2003::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::USING LATENT CLASS MODELS TO CHARACTERIZE AND ASSESS RELATIVE ERROR IN DISCRETE MEASUREMENTS+ESPELAND, MA; HANDELMAN, SL+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1989::Mixture of latent trait analyzers for model-based clustering of categorical data+Gollini, Isabella; Murphy, Thomas Brendan+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUL 2014::EXPLORATORY LATENT STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS USING BOTH IDENTIFIABLE AND UNIDENTIFIABLE MODELS+GOODMAN, LA+BIOMETRIKA+1974::no title+Govaert, G.+Data Analysis+2010::LATENT STRUCTURE MODELS WITH DIRECT EFFECTS BETWEEN INDICATORS - LOCAL DEPENDENCE MODELS+HAGENAARS, JA+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+FEB 1988::Idiot's Bayes - Not so stupid after all?+Hand, DJ; Yu, KM+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2001::Automated variable weighting in k-means type clustering+Huang, JZX; Ng, MK; Rong, HQ; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+MAY 2005::COMPARING PARTITIONS+HUBERT, L; ARABIE, P+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1985::no title+JAJUGA, K.; SOKOLOWSKI, A.; BOCK, H.+Classification, Clustering and Data Analysis: Recent Advances and Applications+2002::Mixture model clustering of data sets with categorical and continuous variables+Jorgensen, M.A.; Hunt, L.A.+P C INF STAT IND SCI+1996::3-WAY ARRAYS - RANK AND UNIQUENESS OF TRILINEAR DECOMPOSITIONS, WITH APPLICATION TO ARITHMETIC COMPLEXITY AND STATISTICS+KRUSKAL, JB+LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS+1977::MORE FACTORS THAN SUBJECTS, TESTS AND TREATMENTS - INDETERMINACY THEOREM FOR CANONICAL DECOMPOSITION AND INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES SCALING+KRUSKAL, JB+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1976::Rmixmod: the R package of the model-based unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised classification mixmod library+Lebret, R; Iovleff, S; Langrognet, F<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G</span>.+J Stat Softw+2014::no title+McLachlan, G; Peel, D.+Finite mixutre models.

Power analysis for the bootstrap likelihood ratio test for the number of classes in latent class models,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0251-0,JUN 2016,38,5,"Latent class (LC) analysis is used to construct empirical evidence on the existence of latent subgroups based on the associations among a set of observed discrete variables. One of the tests used to infer about the number of underlying subgroups is the bootstrap likelihood ratio test (BLRT). Although power analysis is rarely conducted for this test, it is important to identify, clarify, and specify the design issues that influence the statistical inference on the number of latent classes based on the BLRT. This paper proposes a computationally efficient 'short-cut' method to evaluate the power of the BLRT, as well as presents a procedure to determine a required sample size to attain a specific power level. Results of our numerical study showed that this short-cut method yields reliable estimates of the power of the BLRT. The numerical study also showed that the sample size required to achieve a specified power level depends on various factors of which the class separation plays a dominant role. In some situations, a sample size of 200 may be enough, while in others 2000 or more subjects are required to achieve the required power.","Bootstrap,Latent class models,Likelihood ratio test,Power,Sample size","NORMAL MIXTURE,ASYMPTOTIC-DISTRIBUTION,COMPONENTS,STATISTICS,SIMULATION","Tekle, Fetene B.@Janssen Res & Dev, Dept Nonclin Stat & Comp, Beerse, Belgium::Gudicha, Dereje W.@Tilburg Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands::Vermunt, Jeroen K.@Tilburg Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","Tekle, Fetene B.@Janssen Pharmaceuticals@Johnson & Johnson::Gudicha, Dereje W.@Tilburg University::Vermunt, Jeroen K.@Tilburg University","vermunt, jeroen@K-3680-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9053-9330","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Probabilistic models in cluster analysis+Bock, HH+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 15 1996::no title+Cohen, J.+Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences+1988::no title+Collins,, L.

Item selection by latent class-based methods: an application to nursing home evaluation,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0232-3,JUN 2016,29,3,"The evaluation of nursing homes is usually based on the administration of questionnaires made of a large number of polytomous items to their patients. In such a context, the latent class model represents a useful tool for clustering subjects in homogenous groups corresponding to different degrees of impairment of the health conditions. It is known that the performance of model-based clustering and the accuracy of the choice of the number of latent classes may be affected by the presence of irrelevant or noise variables. In this paper, we show the application of an item selection algorithm to a dataset collected within a project, named ULISSE, on the quality-of-life of elderly patients hosted in Italian nursing homes. This algorithm, which is closely related to that proposed by Dean and Raftery in 2010, is aimed at finding the subset of items which provides the best clustering according to the Bayesian Information Criterion. At the same time, it allows us to select the optimal number of latent classes. Given the complexity of the ULISSE study, we perform a validation of the results by means of a sensitivity analysis, with respect to different specifications of the initial subset of items, and of a resampling procedure.","Bayesian information criterion,Expectation-maximization algorithm,Polytomous items,Quality-of-life,ULISSE project","EM ALGORITHM,HEALTH-CARE,MODELS,LIKELIHOOD,VALUES","Bartolucci, Francesco@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, I-06100 Perugia, Italy::Montanari, Giorgio E.@Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, I-06100 Perugia, Italy::Pandolfi, Silvia@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, I-06100 Perugia, Italy","Bartolucci, Francesco@University of Perugia::Montanari, Giorgio E.@University of Perugia::Pandolfi, Silvia@University of Perugia","Montanari, Giorgio Eduardo@H-4252-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6019-6605::Bartolucci, Francesco@J-7877-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7057-1421","A Class of Multidimensional Latent Class IRT Models for Ordinal Polytomous Item Responses+Bacci, Silvia; Bartolucci, Francesco; Gnaldi, Michela+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+FEB 16 2014::Latent variable regression for multiple discrete outcomes+Bandeen-Roche, K; Miglioretti, DL; Zeger, SL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::Phenotype of frailty: Characterization in the women's health and aging studies+Bandeen-Roche, K; Xue, QL; Ferrucci, L; et al.+JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES+MAR 2006::Choosing starting values for the EM algorithm for getting the highest likelihood in multivariate Gaussian mixture models+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::Ageing, health, and health care+Breyer, Friedrich; Costa-Font, Joan; Felder, Stefan+OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY+WIN 2010::Latent class analysis variable selection+Dean, Nema; Raftery, Adrian E.+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+FEB 2010::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::How Does Ageing Affect the Welfare State?+Galasso, V.; Profeta, P.+European Journal of Political Economy+2007::EXPLORATORY LATENT STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS USING BOTH IDENTIFIABLE AND UNIDENTIFIABLE MODELS+GOODMAN, LA+BIOMETRIKA+1974::Partial and latent ignorability in missing-data problems+Harel, Ofer; Schafer, Joseph L.+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2009::Development of the nursing home Resident Assessment Instrument in the USA+Hawes, C; Morris, JN; Phillips, CD; et al.+AGE AND AGEING+SEP 1997::Choosing initial values for the EM algorithm for finite mixtures+Karlis, D; Xekalaki, E+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::BAYES FACTORS+KASS, RE; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::The emergence of lowest-low fertility in Europe during the 1990s+Kohler, HP; Billari, FC; Ortega, JA+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+DEC 2002::Health status transitions in community-living elderly with complex care needs: a latent class approach.+Lafortune, Louise; Beland, Francois; Bergman, Howard; et al.+BMC geriatrics+2009 Feb 03::Health care for older people in Italy: The ULISSE project (Un Link Informatico sui Servizi Sanitari Esistenti per l'anziano - a computerized network on health care services for older people)+Lattanzio, F.; Mussi, C.; Scafato, E.; et al.+JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH &amp; AGING+MAR 2010::no title+Lazarsfeld, P.

A principal component method to impute missing values for mixed data,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0195-1,MAR 2016,33,7,"We propose a new method to impute missing values in mixed data sets. It is based on a principal component method, the factorial analysis for mixed data, which balances the influence of all the variables that are continuous and categorical in the construction of the principal components. Because the imputation uses the principal axes and components, the prediction of the missing values is based on the similarity between individuals and on the relationships between variables. The properties of the method are illustrated via simulations and the quality of the imputation is assessed using real data sets. The method is compared to a recent method (Stekhoven and Buhlmann Bioinformatics 28:113-118, 2011) based on random forest and shows better performance especially for the imputation of categorical variables and situations with highly linear relationships between continuous variables.","Missing values,Mixed data,Imputation,Principal component method,Factorial analysis of mixed data","MULTIPLE CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS,ALGORITHMS,IMPUTATION","Audigier, Vincent@Agrocampus Ouest, 65 Rue St Brieuc, F-35042 Rennes, France::Husson, Francois@Agrocampus Ouest, 65 Rue St Brieuc, F-35042 Rennes, France::Josse, Julie@Agrocampus Ouest, 65 Rue St Brieuc, F-35042 Rennes, France","Audigier, Vincent@Agrocampus Ouest::Husson, Francois@Agrocampus Ouest::Josse, Julie@Agrocampus Ouest",not exist,"L'Analyse des Donnees.+Benzecri, J.

Extreme logistic regression,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0194-2,MAR 2016,40,1,"Kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a very powerful algorithm that has been shown to be very competitive with many state-of the art machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM). Unlike SVM, KLR can be easily extended to multi-class problems and produces class posterior probability estimates making it very useful for many real world applications. However, the training of KLR using gradient based methods or iterative re-weighted least squares can be unbearably slow for large datasets. Coupled with poor conditioning and parameter tuning, training KLR can quickly design matrix become infeasible for some real datasets. The goal of this paper is to present simple, fast, scalable, and efficient algorithms for learning KLR. First, based on a simple approximation of the logistic function, a least square algorithm for KLR is derived that avoids the iterative tuning of gradient based methods. Second, inspired by the extreme learning machine (ELM) theory, an explicit feature space is constructed through a generalized single hidden layer feedforward network and used for training iterative re-weighted least squares KLR (IRLS-KLR) and the newly proposed least squares KLR (LS-KLR). Finally, for large-scale and/or poorly conditioned problems, a robust and efficient preconditioned learning technique is proposed for learning the algorithms presented in the paper. Numerical results on a series of artificial and 12 real bench-mark datasets show first that LS-KLR compares favorable with SVM and traditional IRLS-KLR in terms of accuracy and learning speed. Second, the extension of ELM to KLR results in simple, scalable and very fast algorithms with comparable generalization performance to their original versions. Finally, the introduced preconditioned learning method can significantly increase the learning speed of IRLS-KLR.","Kernel logistic regression,Extreme learning machine,Classification,Least squares,Kernel matrix,Preconditioner","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES,LEAST-SQUARES SVM,LEARNING-MACHINE,SPARSE APPROXIMATION,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHM,INVERSE","Ngufor, Che@George Mason Univ, Sch Phys Astron & Computat Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA::Wojtusiak, Janusz@George Mason Univ, Dept Hlth Adm & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Ngufor, Che@George Mason University::Wojtusiak, Janusz@George Mason University",not exist,"KEEL: a software tool to assess evolutionary algorithms for data mining problems+Alcala-Fdez, J.; Sanchez, L.; Garcia, S.; et al.+SOFT COMPUTING+FEB 2009::Predictive low-rank decomposition for kernel methods+Bach, F.

A multilevel finite mixture item response model to cluster examinees and schools,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0196-0,MAR 2016,59,5,"Within the educational context, a key goal is to assess students' acquired skills and to cluster students according to their ability level. In this regard, a relevant element to be accounted for is the possible effect of the school students come from. For this aim, we provide a methodological tool which takes into account the multilevel structure of the data (i.e., students in schools) and allows us to cluster both students and schools into homogeneous classes of ability and effectiveness, and to assess the effect of certain students' and school characteristics on the probability to belong to such classes. The proposed approach relies on an extended class of multidimensional latent class IRT models characterised by: (i) latent traits defined at student and school level, (ii) latent traits represented through random vectors with a discrete distribution, (iii) the inclusion of covariates at student and school level, and (iv) a two-parameter logistic parametrisation for the conditional probability of a correct response given the ability. The approach is applied for the analysis of data collected by two national tests administered in Italy to middle school students in June 2009: the INVALSI Language Test and the Mathematics Test.","EM algorithm,INVALSI Tests,Latent class model,Multilevel multidimensional item response models,Two-parameter logistic model","LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS,RASCH MODEL,TESTING UNIDIMENSIONALITY,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,IRT MODELS,VARIABLES","Gnaldi, Michela@Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy::Bacci, Silvia@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy::Bartolucci, Francesco@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy","Gnaldi, Michela@University of Perugia::Bacci, Silvia@University of Perugia::Bartolucci, Francesco@University of Perugia","Bartolucci, Francesco@J-7877-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7057-1421","A Class of Multidimensional Latent Class IRT Models for Ordinal Polytomous Item Responses+Bacci, Silvia; Bartolucci, Francesco; Gnaldi, Michela+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+FEB 16 2014::MultiLCIRT: An R package for multidimensional latent class item response models+Bartolucci, Francesco; Bacci, Silvia; Gnaldi, Michela+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 2014::Assessment of School Performance Through a Multilevel Latent Markov Rasch Model+Bartolucci, Francesco; Pennoni, Fulvia; Vittadini, Giorgio+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+AUG 2011::A class of multidimensional IRT models for testing unidimensionality and clustering items+Bartolucci, Francesco+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2007::Choosing models in model-based clustering and discriminant analysis+Biernacki, C; Govaert, G+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1999::Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::Estimating latent structure models with categorical variables: One-step versus three-step estimators+Bolck, A; Croon, M; Hagenaars, J+POLITICAL ANALYSIS+WIN 2004::Item parameter estimation under conditions of test speededness: Application of a mixture Rasch model with ordinal constraints+Bolt, DM; Cohen, AS; Wollack, JA+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+WIN 2002::A Multilevel Mixture IRT Model With an Application to DIF+Cho, Sun-Joo; Cohen, Allan S.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+JUN 2010::Testing unidimensionality in polytomous Rasch models+Christensen, KB; Bjorner, JB; Kreiner, S; et al.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2002::Setting performance standards: Contemporary methods+Cizek, G.

Supervised clustering of variables,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0191-5,MAR 2016,18,1,"In predictive modelling, highly correlated predictors lead to unstable models that are often difficult to interpret. The selection of features, or the use of latent components that reduce the complexity among correlated observed variables, are common strategies. Our objective with the new procedure that we advocate here is to achieve both purposes: to highlight the group structure among the variables and to identify the most relevant groups of variables for prediction. The proposed procedure is an iterative adaptation of a method developed for the clustering of variables around latent variables (CLV). Modification of the standard CLV algorithm leads to a supervised procedure, in the sense that the variable to be predicted plays an active role in the clustering. The latent variables associated with the groups of variables, selected for their ""proximity"" to the variable to be predicted and their ""internal homogeneity"", are progressively added in a predictive model. The features of the methodology are illustrated based on a simulation study and a real-world application.","Prediction,Clustering of variables around latent variables (CLV),Forward regression model,Sparse PLS regression","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,FEATURE-SELECTION,REGRESSION,LASSO","Chen, Mingkun@LUNAM Univ, Sensometr & Chemometr Lab, ONIRIS, Site Geraudiere,BP 82225, F-44300 Nantes 3, France::Vigneau, Evelyne@LUNAM Univ, Sensometr & Chemometr Lab, ONIRIS, Site Geraudiere,BP 82225, F-44300 Nantes 3, France","Chen, Mingkun@Oniris::Vigneau, Evelyne@Oniris",not exist,"STANDARD NORMAL VARIATE TRANSFORMATION AND DE-TRENDING OF NEAR-INFRARED DIFFUSE REFLECTANCE SPECTRA+BARNES, RJ; DHANOA, MS; LISTER, SJ+APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY+JUL 1989::Sparse partial least squares regression for simultaneous dimension reduction and variable selection+Chun, Hyonho; Keles, Suenduez+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2010::Repeated double cross validation+Filzmoser, Peter; Liebmann, Bettina; Varmuza, Kurt+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+MAR-APR 2009::Supervised harvesting of expression trees+Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Robert; Botstein, David; et al.+GENOME BIOLOGY+2001::A modified principal component technique based on the LASSO+Jolliffe, IT; Trendafilov, NT; Uddin, M+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2003::A Sparse PLS for Variable Selection when Integrating Omics Data+Le Cao, Kim-Anh; Rossouw, Debra; Robert-Granie, Christele; et al.+STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY+2008::A DC programming approach for feature selection in support vector machines learning+Le Thi, Hoai An; Le, Hoai Minh; Nguyen, Van Vinh; et al.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+DEC 2008::GENETIC ALGORITHMS AS A STRATEGY FOR FEATURE-SELECTION+LEARDI, R; BOGGIA, R; TERRILE, M+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+SEP-OCT 1992::Predicting sensory profiles from external instrumental measurements+Naes, T; Kowalski, B.+Food Qual Prefer+1989::Averaged gene expressions for regression+Park, Mee Young; Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Robert+BIOSTATISTICS+APR 2007::Clustering and classification via cluster-weighted factor analyzers+Subedi, Sanjeena; Punzo, Antonio; Ingrassia, Salvatore; et al.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+MAR 2013::Regression shrinkage and selection via the Lasso+Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Clustering and disjoint principal component analysis+Vichi, Maurizio; Saporta, Gilbert+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 15 2009::Clustering of variables around latent components+Vigneau, E; Qannari, EM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2003::Clustering of variables to analyze spectral data+Vigneau, E; Sahmer, K; Qannari, EM; et al.+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+MAR 2005::Finding and explaining clusters of consumers using the CLV approach+Vigneau, Evelyne; Endrizzi, Isabella; Qannari, El Mostafa+FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE+DEC 2011::Sparse principal component analysis+Zou, H; Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2006::Regularization and variable selection via the elastic net+Zou, H; Hastie, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2005"
The k-means algorithm for 3D shapes with an application to apparel design,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0187-1,MAR 2016,54,4,"Clustering of objects according to shapes is of key importance in many scientific fields. In this paper we focus on the case where the shape of an object is represented by a configuration matrix of landmarks. It is well known that this shape space has a finite-dimensional Riemannian manifold structure (non-Euclidean) which makes it difficult to work with. Papers about clustering on this space are scarce in the literature. The basic foundation of the -means algorithm is the fact that the sample mean is the value that minimizes the Euclidean distance from each point to the centroid of the cluster to which it belongs, so, our idea is integrating the Procrustes type distances and Procrustes mean into the -means algorithm to adapt it to the shape analysis context. As far as we know, there have been just two attempts in that way. In this paper we propose to adapt the classical -means Lloyd algorithm to the context of Shape Analysis, focusing on the three dimensional case. We present a study comparing its performance with the Hartigan-Wong -means algorithm, one that was previously adapted to the field of Statistical Shape Analysis. We demonstrate the better performance of the Lloyd version and, finally, we propose to add a trimmed procedure. We apply both to a 3D database obtained from an anthropometric survey of the Spanish female population conducted in this country in 2006. The algorithms presented in this paper are available in the Anthropometry R package, whose most current version is always available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.","Shape space,Statistical shape analysis,k-means algorithm,Procrustes type distances,Procrustes mean shape,Sizing systems","RIEMANNIAN-MANIFOLDS,IMPLEMENTATION,CONSISTENCY,STATISTICS","Vinue, Guillermo@OR Univ Valencia, Dept Stat, C Dr Moliner 50, Valencia 46100, Spain::Simo, Amelia@Univ Jaume 1, Dept Math IMAC, Avda Riu Sec S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain::Alemany, Sandra@Univ Politecn Valencia, Biomechan Inst Valencia, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain","Vinue, Guillermo@Unknow::Simo, Amelia@Universitat Jaume I::Alemany, Sandra@Universitat Politecnica de Valencia","Simo, Amelia@D-6321-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5507-2907::Vinue, Guillermo@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2083-8276","Anthropometric survey of the spanish female population aimed at the apparel industry+Alemany, S; Gonzalez, JC; Nacher, B<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Soriano, C; Arnaiz, C; Heras, H</span>.+P 2010 INT C 3D BOD+2010::k-Means Algorithm in Statistical Shape Analysis+Amaral, Getulio J.

A comparison of reliability coefficients for psychometric tests that consist of two parts,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0198-6,MAR 2016,19,2,"If a test consists of two parts the Spearman-Brown formula and Flanagan's coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) are standard tools for estimating the reliability. However, the coefficients may be inappropriate if their associated measurement models fail to hold. We study the robustness of reliability estimation in the two-part case to coefficient misspecification. We compare five reliability coefficients and study various conditions on the standard deviations and lengths of the parts. Various conditional upper bounds of the differences between the coefficients are derived. It is shown that the difference between the Spearman-Brown formula and Horst's formula is negligible in many cases. We conclude that all five reliability coefficients can be used if there are only small or moderate differences between the standard deviations and the lengths of the parts.","Spearman-Brown formula,Cronbach's alpha,Flanagan's coefficient,Angoff-Feldt coefficient,Raju's beta,Horst's formula","UNEQUAL LENGTH,ALPHA,SPLIT","Warrens, Matthijs J.@Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, Unit Methodol & Stat, POB 9555, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands","Warrens, Matthijs J.@Leiden University",not exist,"no title+ANGOFF WH+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1953::SOME EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS IN THE CORRELATION OF MENTAL ABILITIES+Brown, William+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY+OCT 1910::WHAT IS COEFFICIENT ALPHA - AN EXAMINATION OF THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+CORTINA, JM+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 1993::no title+CRONBACH LJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1951::Reliability+Feldt, L.; Brennan, R.+Educational measurement+1989::Estimating the reliability of a test split into two parts of equal or unequal length+Feldt, LS; Charter, RA+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 2003::ESTIMATION OF RELIABILITY OF A TEST DIVIDED INTO 2 PARTS OF UNEQUAL LENGTH+FELDT, LS+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1975::Some myths and legends in quantitative psychology+Grayson, D.+Understanding Statistics+2004::no title+GUTTMAN L+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1945::Reliability methods: A note on the frequency of use of various types+Hogan, TP; Benjamin, A; Brezinski, KL+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+AUG 2000::ESTIMATING TOTAL TEST RELIABILITY FROM PARTS OF UNEQUAL LENGTH+Horst, Paul+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+FAL 1951::no title+no author+IBM SPSS Statistics 20 Algorithms Manual+2011::no title+Lord, FM; Novick, MR.+Statistical Theories of Mental Test Scores+1968::Coefficient alpha and related internal consistency reliability coefficients+Osburn, HG+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2000::GENERALIZATION OF COEFFICIENT ALPHA+RAJU, NS+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1977::A Simplified Procedure for Determining the Reliability of a Test by Split-Halves+Rulon, Phillip J.+HARVARD EDUCATIONAL REVIEW+JAN 1939::CORRELATION CALCULATED FROM FAULTY DATA+Spearman, C.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY+OCT 1910::On Cronbach's alpha as the mean of all possible k-split alphas+Warrens, MJ.+Adv Stat+2014::Some relationships between Cronbach's alpha and the Spearman-Brown formula+Warrens, MJ.+J Classif+2015"
Fuzzy rule based classification systems for big data with MapReduce: granularity analysis,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-016-0260-z,DEC 2017,35,5,"Due to the vast amount of information available nowadays, and the advantages related to the processing of this data, the topics of big data and data science have acquired a great importance in the current research. Big data applications are mainly about scalability, which can be achieved via the MapReduce programming model.It is designed to divide the data into several chunks or groups that are processed in parallel, and whose result is ""assembled"" to provide a single solution. Among different classification paradigms adapted to this new framework, fuzzy rule based classification systems have shown interesting results with a MapReduce approach for big data. It is well known that the performance of these types of systems has a strong dependence on the selection of a good granularity level for the Data Base. However, in the context of MapReduce this parameter is even harder to determine as it can be also related with the number of Maps chosen for the processing stage. In this paper, we aim at analyzing the interrelation between the number of labels of the fuzzy variables and the scarcity of the data due to the data sampling in MapReduce. Specifically, we consider that as the partitioning of the initial instance set grows, the level of granularity necessary to achieve a good performance also becomes higher. The experimental results, carried out for several Big Data problems, and using the Chi-FRBCS-BigData algorithms, support our claims.","Big data,Fuzzy rule based classification systems,Granularity,MapReduce,Hadoop","DATA SCIENCE,CHALLENGES,ANALYTICS,PROPOSAL","Fernandez, Alberto@Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Granada, Spain::del Rio, Sara@Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Granada, Spain::Bawakid, Abdullah@King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia::Herrera, Francisco@Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Granada, Spain@King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Fernandez, Alberto@University of Granada::del Rio, Sara@University of Granada::Bawakid, Abdullah@King Abdulaziz University::Herrera, Francisco@King Abdulaziz University@University of Granada",not exist,"Data-intensive applications, challenges, techniques and technologies: A survey on Big Data+Chen, C.

Improved initialisation of model-based clustering using Gaussian hierarchical partitions,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0220-z,DEC 2015,30,6,"Initialisation of the EM algorithm in model-based clustering is often crucial. Various starting points in the parameter space often lead to different local maxima of the likelihood function and, so to different clustering partitions. Among the several approaches available in the literature, model-based agglomerative hierarchical clustering is used to provide initial partitions in the popular mclust R package. This choice is computationally convenient and often yields good clustering partitions. However, in certain circumstances, poor initial partitions may cause the EM algorithm to converge to a local maximum of the likelihood function. We propose several simple and fast refinements based on data transformations and illustrate them through data examples.","Model-based clustering,Model-based agglomerative hierarchical clustering,mclust,Data transformation","EM ALGORITHM,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,LIKELIHOOD","Scrucca, Luca@Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Econ, I-06123 Perugia, Italy::Raftery, Adrian E.@Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Scrucca, Luca@University of Perugia::Raftery, Adrian E.@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle","Scrucca, Luca@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3826-0484","no title+Auder, B.; Lebret, R.; Iovleff, S.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Langrognet, F</span>.+Rmixmod: An Interface for MIXMOD, R Package Version 2.0.2+2014::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::Choosing starting values for the EM algorithm for getting the highest likelihood in multivariate Gaussian mixture models+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2000::Model-based cluster and discriminant analysis with the MIXMOD software+Biernacki, Christophe; Celeux, Gilles; Govaert, Gerard; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 15 2006::GAUSSIAN PARSIMONIOUS CLUSTERING MODELS+CELEUX, G; GOVAERT, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION+MAY 1995::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+Dubes, R.C; Jain, A.K.+Algorithms for clustering data+1988::no title+Everitt, B.

Maximum likelihood estimation of Gaussian mixture models without matrix operations,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0209-7,DEC 2015,38,8,"The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a popular tool for multivariate analysis, in particular, cluster analysis. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is generally used to perform maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for GMMs due to the M-step existing in closed form and its desirable numerical properties, such as monotonicity. However, the EM algorithm has been criticized as being slow to converge and thus computationally expensive in some situations. In this article, we introduce the linear regression characterization (LRC) of the GMM. We show that the parameters of an LRC of the GMM can be mapped back to the natural parameters, and that a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm can be constructed, which retains the desirable numerical properties of the EM algorithm, without the use of matrix operations. We prove that the ML estimators of the LRC parameters are consistent and asymptotically normal, like their natural counterparts. Furthermore, we show that the LRC allows for simple handling of singularities in the ML estimation of GMMs. Using numerical simulations in the R programming environment, we then demonstrate that the MM algorithm can be faster than the EM algorithm in various large data situations, where sample sizes range in the tens to hundreds of thousands and for estimating models with up to 16 mixture components on multivariate data with up to 16 variables.","Gaussian mixture model,Minorization-maximization algorithm,matrix operation-free,Linear Regression","EM ALGORITHM,FINITE MIXTURE,MM ALGORITHMS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Nguyen, Hien D.@Univ Queensland, Dept Math, Sch Math & Phys, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia::McLachlan, Geoffrey J.@Univ Queensland, Dept Math, Sch Math & Phys, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Nguyen, Hien D.@University of Queensland::McLachlan, Geoffrey J.@University of Queensland",not exist,"no title+Amemiya, T.+Advanced Econometrics.+1985::no title+Anderson, T.W.+An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+2003::Using evolutionary algorithms for model-based clustering+Andrews, Jeffrey L.; McNicholas, Paul D.+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+JUL 1 2013::On the consistency of MLE in finite mixture models of exponential families+Atienza, N.; Garcia-Heras, J.; Munoz-Pichardo, J.

Probabilistic assessment of model-based clustering,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0215-9,DEC 2015,43,0,"Finite mixtures provide a powerful tool for modeling heterogeneous data. Model-based clustering is a broadly used grouping technique that assumes the existence of the one-to-one correspondence between clusters and mixture model components. Although there are many directions of active research in the model-based clustering framework, very little attention has been paid to studying the specific nature of detected clustering solutions. In this paper, we develop an approach for assessing the variability in classifications carried out by the Bayes decision rule. The proposed technique allows assessing significance of each assignment made. We also apply the developed instrument for identifying influential observations that have impact on the structure of the detected partitioning. The proposed diagnostic methodology is studied and illustrated on synthetic data and applied to the analysis of three well-known classification datasets.","Model-based clustering classification,Influential observations,Diagnostics,Gaussian mixture models","GAUSSIAN MIXTURE-MODELS,EM ALGORITHM,SIMULATING DATA,MULTIVARIATE,PERFORMANCE,LIKELIHOOD,COMPONENTS","Zhu, Xuwen@Univ Alabama, Dept Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA::Melnykov, Volodymyr@Univ Alabama, Dept Informat Syst Stat & Management Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Zhu, Xuwen@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa::Melnykov, Volodymyr@University of Alabama System@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa","Zhu, Xuwen@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7644-2695","The Irises of the Gaspe Peninsula.+Anderson, E.+Bulletin of the American Iris society+1935::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::Combining Mixture Components for Clustering+Baudry, Jean-Patrick; Raftery, Adrian E.; Celeux, Gilles; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2010::Real-Time Volume Estimation of a Dragline Payload+Bewley, Alex; Shekhar, Rajiv; Leonard, Sam; et al.+2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)+2011::Choosing starting values for the EM algorithm for getting the highest likelihood in multivariate Gaussian mixture models+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::Model-based clustering of high-dimensional data: A review+Bouveyron, Charles; Brunet-Saumard, Camille+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 2014::MULTIVARIATE STUDY OF VARIATION IN 2 SPECIES OF ROCK CRAB OF GENUS LEPTOGRAPSUS+CAMPBELL, NA; MAHON, RJ+AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY+1974::no title+Casella, G; Berger, R.+Statistical Inference+2001::Complete Gradient Clustering Algorithm for Features Analysis of X-Ray Images+Charytanowicz, Malgorzata; Niewczas, Jerzy; Kulczycki, Piotr; et al.+INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN BIOMEDICINE, VOL 2+2010::A simulation study to compare robust clustering methods based on mixtures+Coretto, Pietro; Hennig, Christian+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2010::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+Driver, H.

Robust model-based clustering via mixtures of skew-t distributions with missing information,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0221-y,DEC 2015,66,2,"Multivariate mixture modeling approach using the skew-t distribution has emerged as a powerful and flexible tool for robust model-based clustering. The occurrence of missing data is a ubiquitous problem in almost every scientific field. In this paper, we offer a computationally flexible EM-type procedure for learning multivariate skew-t mixture models to deal with missing data under missing at random mechanisms. Further, we present an information-based approach to approximating the asymptotic covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimators using the outer product of the scores. To assist the development and ease the implementation of our algorithm, two auxiliary permutation matrices are utilized for fast determination of the observed and missing parts of each observation. The practical usefulness of the proposed methodology is illustrated through simulations with varying proportions of artificial missing values and a real data example with genuine missing values.","Classifier,ECM algorithm,Imputation,Missing at random,MST distribution","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,EM ALGORITHM,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,INCOMPLETE DATA,FINITE MIXTURE,CLASSIFICATION,ESTIMATOR,INFERENCE","Wang, Wan-Lun@Feng Chia Univ, Grad Inst Stat & Actuarial Sci, Dept Stat, Taichung 40724, Taiwan::Lin, Tsung-I@Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Inst Stat, Taichung 402, Taiwan@China Med Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Taichung 404, Taiwan","Wang, Wan-Lun@Feng Chia University::Lin, Tsung-I@China Medical University Taiwan@National Chung Hsing University",not exist,"no title+Aitken, A.+Proc.

Simulating mixtures of multivariate data with fixed cluster overlap in FSDA library,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0223-9,DEC 2015,27,3,"We extend the capabilities of MixSim, a framework which is useful for evaluating the performance of clustering algorithms, on the basis of measures of agreement between data partitioning and flexible generation methods for data, outliers and noise. The peculiarity of the method is that data are simulated from normal mixture distributions on the basis of pre-specified synthesis statistics on an overlap measure, defined as a sum of pairwise misclassification probabilities. We provide new tools which enable us to control additional overlapping statistics and departures from homogeneity and sphericity among groups, together with new outlier contamination schemes. The output of this extension is a more flexible framework for generation of data to better address modern robust clustering scenarios in presence of possible contamination. We also study the properties and the implications that this new way of simulating clustering data entails in terms of coverage of space, goodness of fit to theoretical distributions, and degree of convergence to nominal values. We demonstrate the new features using our MATLAB implementation that we have integrated in the Flexible Statistics for Data Analysis (FSDA) toolbox for MATLAB. With MixSim, FSDA now integrates in the same environment state of the art robust clustering algorithms and principled routines for their evaluation and calibration. A spin off of our work is a general complex routine, translated from C language to MATLAB, to compute the distribution function of a linear combinations of non central random variables which is at the core of MixSim and has its own interest for many test statistics.","MixSim,FSDA,Synthetic data,Mixture models,Robust clustering","DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,ROBUST,ALGORITHMS,PERFORMANCE,REGRESSION,SOFTWARE","Riani, Marco@Univ Parma, I-43125 Parma, Italy::Cerioli, Andrea@Univ Parma, I-43125 Parma, Italy::Perrotta, Domenico@European Commiss, Global Secur & Crisis Management Unit, Inst Protect & Secur Citizen, Joint Res Ctr, I-21027 Ispra, Italy::Torti, Francesca@European Commiss, Global Secur & Crisis Management Unit, Inst Protect & Secur Citizen, Joint Res Ctr, I-21027 Ispra, Italy","Riani, Marco@University of Parma::Cerioli, Andrea@University of Parma::Perrotta, Domenico@European Commission Joint Research Centre@EC JRC ISPRA Site::Torti, Francesca@European Commission Joint Research Centre@EC JRC ISPRA Site","Perrotta, Domenico@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0987-3823::Riani, Marco@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7886-2207","A review of robust clustering methods+Angel Garcia-Escudero, Luis; Gordaliza, Alfonso; Matran, Carlos; et al.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2010::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::Model-based cluster and discriminant analysis with the MIXMOD software+Biernacki, Christophe; Celeux, Gilles; Govaert, Gerard; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 15 2006::Testing mutual independence between two discrete-valued spatial processes: A correction to Pearson chi-squared+Cerioli, A+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2002::Robust clustering around regression lines with high density regions+Cerioli, Andrea; Perrotta, Domenico+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+MAR 2014::The distribution of a linear combination of chi2 random variables+Davies, R.+Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C: Applied Statistics+1980::NUMERICAL INVERSION OF A CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION+DAVIES, RB+BIOMETRIKA+1973::Computing the distribution of quadratic forms: Further comparisons between the Liu-Tang-Zhang approximation and exact methods+Duchesne, Pierre; De Micheaux, Pierre Lafaye+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 1 2010::Robust Constrained Clustering in Presence of Entry-Wise Outliers+Farcomeni, Alessio+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2014::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::A fast algorithm for robust constrained clustering+Fritz, Heinrich; Garcia-Escudero, Luis A.; Mayo-Iscar, Agustin+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 2013::A constrained robust proposal for mixture modeling avoiding spurious solutions+Garcia-Escudero, L.

Latent drop-out based transitions in linear quantile hidden Markov models for longitudinal responses with attrition,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-015-0222-x,DEC 2015,31,1,"Longitudinal data are characterized by the dependence between observations from the same individual. In a regression perspective, such a dependence can be usefully ascribed to unobserved features (covariates) specific to each individual. On these grounds, random parameter models with time-constant or time-varying structure are now well established in the generalized linear model context. In the quantile regression framework, specifications based on random parameters have only recently known a flowering interest. We start from the recent proposal by Farcomeni (Stat Comput 22:141-152, 2012) on longitudinal quantile hidden Markov models, and extend it to handle potentially informative missing data mechanisms. In particular, we focus on monotone missingness which may lead to selection bias and, therefore, to unreliable inferences on model parameters. We detail the proposed approach by re-analyzing a well known dataset on the dynamics of CD4 cell counts in HIV seroconverters and by means of a simulation study reported in the supplementary material.","Quantile regression,Longitudinal data,Hidden Markov models,Latent drop-out classes","PATTERN-MIXTURE-MODELS,REGRESSION-MODELS,INCOMPLETE DATA","Marino, Maria Francesca@Univ Perugia, I-06100 Perugia, Italy::Alfo, Marco@Univ Roma La Sapienza, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Marino, Maria Francesca@University of Perugia::Alfo, Marco@Sapienza University Rome","Marino, Maria Francesca@F-2290-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5841-7613","no title+AGRESTI, ALAN.+Analysis of ordinal categorical data+2010::Mixed hidden Markov models: An extension of the hidden Markov model to the longitudinal data setting+Altman, Rachel MacKay+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2007::no title+Bartolucci, F.; Farcomeni, A.; Pennoni, F.+Latent Markov Models for Longitudinal Data+2013::A Discrete Time Event-History Approach to Informative Drop-Out in Mixed Latent Markov Models with Covariates+Bartolucci, Francesco; Farcomeni, Alessio+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2015::A MAXIMIZATION TECHNIQUE OCCURRING IN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS OF MARKOV CHAINS+BAUM, LE; PETRIE, T; SOULES, G; et al.+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1970::ESTIMATING THE ASYMPTOTIC COVARIANCE-MATRIX FOR QUANTILE REGRESSION-MODELS - A MONTE-CARLO STUDY+BUCHINSKY, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+AUG 1995::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Quantile regression for longitudinal data based on latent Markov subject-specific parameters+Farcomeni, Alessio+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2012::Longitudinal quantile regression in the presence of informative dropout through longitudinal-survival joint modeling+Farcomeni, Alessio; Viviani, Sara+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 30 2015::Quantile regression for longitudinal data using the asymmetric Laplace distribution+Geraci, Marco; Bottai, Matteo+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2007::Linear quantile mixed models+Geraci, Marco; Bottai, Matteo+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAY 2014::THE MULTICENTER AIDS COHORT STUDY - RATIONALE, ORGANIZATION, AND SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICIPANTS+KASLOW, RA; OSTROW, DG; DETELS, R; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+AUG 1987::REGRESSION QUANTILES+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1978::RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS FOR LONGITUDINAL DATA+LAIRD, NM; WARE, JH+BIOMETRICS+1982::LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS USING GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+LIANG, KY; ZEGER, SL+BIOMETRIKA+APR 1986::Quantile regression methods for longitudinal data with drop-outs: Application to CD4 cell counts of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus+Lipsitz, SR; Fitzmaurice, GM; Molenberghs, G; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1997::no title+Little, R.

Financial clustering in presence of dominant markets,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0189-z,SEP 2015,34,1,"Clustering financial time series is a recent topic of statistical literature with important fields of applications, in particular portfolio composition and risk evaluation. The risk is generally linked to the volatility of the asset, but its level of predictability also plays a basic role in investment decisions. In particular, the classification of a certain asset could be linked to its dependence on the volatility of a dominant market: movements in the volatility of the dominant market can provide similar movements in the volatility of the asset and its predictability would depend on the strength of this dependence. Working in a model based framework, we base the classification of the volatility of an asset not only on its volatility level, but also on the presence of spillover effects from a dominant market, such as the US one, and on the similarity of the dynamics of the asset and the dominant market. The method is carried out using an extended version of the Multiplicative Error Model and is applied to a set of European assets, also performing a historical simulation experiment.","MEM,Unconditional volatility,Spillover effect,Common dynamics,AR distance","TIME-SERIES,MONTE-CARLO,VOLATILITY,MODEL","Otranto, Edoardo@Univ Messina, Educ & Cultural Studies, Dept Cognit Sci, I-98121 Messina, Italy@Univ Messina, CRENoS, I-98121 Messina, Italy::Gargano, Romana@Univ Messina, Educ & Cultural Studies, Dept Cognit Sci, I-98121 Messina, Italy","Otranto, Edoardo@University of Messina::Gargano, Romana@University of Messina",not exist,"Modeling and forecasting realized volatility+Andersen, TG; Bollerslev, T; Diebold, FX; et al.+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2003::Spillover effects from the U.

A new biplot procedure with joint classification of objects and variables by fuzzy c-means clustering,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0184-4,SEP 2015,39,2,"Biplot is a technique for obtaining a low-dimensional configuration of the data matrix in which both the objects and the variables of the data matrix are jointly represented as points and vectors, respectively. However, biplots with a large number of objects and variables remain difficult to interpret. Therefore, in this research, we propose a new biplot procedure that allows us to interpret a large data matrix. In particular, the objects and variables are classified into a small number of clusters by using fuzzy -means clustering and the resulting clusters are simultaneously biplotted in lower-dimensional space. This procedure allows us to understand the configurations easily and to grasp the fuzzy memberships of the objects and variables to the clusters. A simulation study and real data example are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.","Biplot,Fuzzy c-means clustering,Principal component analysis,Singular value decomposition,Alternating least squares","COMPONENT ANALYSIS,REGRESSION,MODELS","Yamashita, Naoto@Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Dept Human Syst Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan::Mayekawa, Shin-ichi@Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Dept Human Syst Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan","Yamashita, Naoto@Tokyo Institute of Technology::Mayekawa, Shin-ichi@Tokyo Institute of Technology",not exist,"Constrained principal component analysis of standardized data for biplots with unit-length variable vectors+Adachi, Kohei+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+APR 2011::Cluster analysis and marketing research+Arabie, P.; Hubert, L.+Advanced Methods in Marketing Research+1994::no title+Bedzek, JC; Keller, J; Krishnaparam, R<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Pal, N</span>.+Fuzzy models and algorithms for pattern recognition and image processing+1999::no title+Benzecri, J.+L'analyse dex donnes: Tome 1, la taxinomie+1973::no title+Benzecri, J.+L'analyse dex donnes: Tome 2, l'analyse des correspondances+1973::FCM - THE FUZZY C-MEANS CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM+BEZDEK, JC; EHRLICH, R; FULL, W+COMPUTERS &amp; GEOSCIENCES+1984::DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CLUSTER SUBSTRUCTURE .1.

Classifying real-world data with the DD alpha-procedure,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0180-8,SEP 2015,47,8,"The -classifier, a nonparametric fast and very robust procedure, is described and applied to fifty classification problems regarding a broad spectrum of real-world data. The procedure first transforms the data from their original property space into a depth space, which is a low-dimensional unit cube, and then separates them by a projective invariant procedure, called -procedure. To each data point the transformation assigns its depth values with respect to the given classes. Several alternative depth notions (spatial depth, Mahalanobis depth, projection depth, and Tukey depth, the latter two being approximated by univariate projections) are used in the procedure, and compared regarding their average error rates. With the Tukey depth, which fits the distributions' shape best and is most robust, 'outsiders', that is data points having zero depth in all classes, appear. They need an additional treatment for classification. Evidence is also given about the dimension of the extended feature space needed for linear separation. The -procedure is available as an R-package.","Classification,Supervised learning,Alpha-procedure,Data depth,Spatial depth,Projection depth,Random Tukey depth,Outsiders,Features","DATA DEPTH,CLASSIFICATION,REGRESSION","Mozharovskyi, Pavlo@Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany::Mosler, Karl@Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany::Lange, Tatjana@Hsch Merseburg, D-06217 Merseburg, Germany","Mozharovskyi, Pavlo@University of Cologne::Mosler, Karl@University of Cologne::Lange, Tatjana@Unknow",not exist,"THE EFFECTS OF FAMILY DISRUPTION ON SOCIAL-MOBILITY+BIBLARZ, TJ; RAFTERY, AE+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+FEB 1993::Comparison between various regression depth methods and the support vector machine to approximate the minimum number of misclassifications+Christmann, A; Fischer, P; Joachims, T+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2002::Measuring overlap in binary regression+Christmann, A; Rousseeuw, PJ+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUL 28 2001::SUPPORT-VECTOR NETWORKS+CORTES, C; VAPNIK, V+MACHINE LEARNING+SEP 1995::Exposition of statistical graphics technology+Cox, L.

A diffusion model for churn prediction based on sociometric theory,ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION,10.1007/s11634-014-0188-0,SEP 2015,31,0,"Churn prediction has received much attention in the last decade. With the evolution of social networks and social network analysis tools in recent years, the consideration of social ties in churn prediction has proven promising. One possibility is to use energy diffusion models to model the spread of influence through a social network. This paper proposes a novel churn prediction diffusion model based on sociometric clique and social status theory. It describes the concept of energy in the diffusion model as an opinion of users, which is transformed to user influence using the derived social status function. Furthermore, a novel diffusion model prediction scheme applicable to a single user or a small subset of users is described: the Targeted User Subset Churn Prediction Scheme. The scheme allows fast churn prediction using limited computing resources. The diffusion model is evaluated on a real dataset of users obtained from the largest Slovenian mobile service provider, using the F-measure and lift curve. The empirical results show a significant improvement in prediction accuracy of the proposed method compared with the basic spreading activation technique (SPA) diffusion model. More specifically, our approach outperforms a basic SPA diffusion model by 116 % in terms of lift in the fifth percentile.","Diffusion model,Churn prediction,Sociometric clique,Social status,Telecommunications","CUSTOMER CHURN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,NETWORKS","Droftina, Uros@Telekom Slovenije, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia::Stular, Mitja@Telekom Slovenije, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia::Kosir, Andrej@Univ Ljubljana, Fac Elect Engn, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Droftina, Uros@Unknow::Stular, Mitja@Unknow::Kosir, Andrej@University of Ljubljana",not exist,"GRAPH-THEORETIC DEFINITION OF A SOCIOMETRIC CLIQUE+ALBA, RD+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY+1973::The Effect of Social Affinity and Predictive Horizon on Churn Prediction Using Diffusion Modeling+Baras, D.; Ronen, A.; Yom-Tov, E.+tech. rep+2012::no title+BLAU P+APPROACHES STUDY SOC+1975::Social ties and their relevance to churn in mobile telecom networks+Dasgupta, Koustuv; Singh, Rahul; Viswanathan, Balaji<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Chakraborty, Dipanjan; Mukherjea, Sougata; Nanavati, Amit A.; Joshi, Anupam</span>.+P 11 INT C EXT DAT T+2008::Estimating the effect of word of mouth on churn and cross-buying in the mobile phone market with Markov logic networks+Dierkes, Torsten; Bichler, Martin; Krishnan, Ramayya+DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS+JUN 2011::Data mining techniques on the evaluation of wireless churn+Ferreira, JB; Vellasco, M; Pacheco, MA<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Barbosa, CH</span>.+P EUR S ART NEUR NET+2004::no title+Gary, M.
