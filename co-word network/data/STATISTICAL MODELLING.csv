"A review on linear mixed models for longitudinal data, possibly subject to dropout",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0100100402,DEC 2001,91,45,"Many approaches are available for the analysis of continuous longitudinal data. Over the last couple of decades, a lot of emphasis has been put on the linear mixed model. The current paper is dedicated to an overview of this approach, with emphasis on model formulation, interpretation and inference. Advantages as well as drawbacks are discussed, and guidelines are given for general statistical practice. Special attention is given to the problem of missing data, i.e., the case where not all data are present as planned in the original design of the study.","dropout,linear mixed models,longitudinal data,missing data,pattern mixture model,random effects,selection model",,"Molenberghs, Geert@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Biostat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Verbeke, Geert@Katholieke Univ Leuven, UZ St Rafael, Ctr Biostat, Leuven, Netherlands","Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt University::Verbeke, Geert@Unknow","Verbeke, Geert@I-5587-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8430-7576","MISSING OBSERVATIONS IN MULTIVARIATE STATISTICS .1.

"A comparison of GEE and random effects models for distinguishing heterogeneity, nonstationarity and state dependence in a collection of short binary event series",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0100100403,DEC 2001,28,13,"GEE transition models and Markov random effect models are applied to a simple panel data set on depression. In each case, the precise specifications adopted were derived from the authors' interpretation of best practice in the literature. The two approaches result in quite different inference on the three process characteristics of interest: state dependence, heterogeneity and nonstationarity. The design of the analyses permits indirect goodness of fit measures to be derived for the GEE models and these indicate serious deficiencies in this approach. It is shown through simulation and further analyses of the depression data that these deficiencies may be corrected by including the initial observation properly in the analyses and by adopting an appropriate variance-covariance structure. The former problem is widely understood in random effects modelling and is relatively straightforward to address within GEE. The latter problem is more difficult because, without model selection or goodness of fit measures generally available for GEE models, it is not clear how one may select empirically between alternative variance-covariance structures. Inappropriate variance-covariance specifications prejudice consistent estimation of state dependence and nonstationarity.","GEE,panel data,random effects,state dependence,transition model",,"Crouchley, R.@Univ Lancaster, Ctr Appl Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YF, England::Davies, R.

A survey of Monte Carlo algorithms for maximizing the likelihood of a two-stage hierarchical model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0100100407,DEC 2001,39,26,"Likelihood inference with hierarchical models is often complicated by the fact that the likelihood function involves intractable integrals. Numerical integration (e.g. quadrature) is an option if the dimension of the integral is low but quickly becomes unreliable as the dimension grows. An alternative approach is to approximate the intractable integrals using Monte Carlo averages. Several different algorithms based on this idea have been proposed.

Exact and approximate REML for heteroscedastic regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0100100301,OCT 2001,36,21,"Exact REML for heteroscedastic linear models is compared with a number of approximate REML methods which have been proposed in the literature, especially with the methods proposed by Lee and Nelder (LN98) and Smyth and Verbyla (SV99) for simultaneous mean-dispersion modelling in generalized linear models. It is shown that neither of the LN98 or SV99 methods reduces to REML in the normal linear case. Asymptotic variances and efficiencies are obtained for these and other estimators of the same general form. A new algorithm is suggested, similar to one suggested by Huele et al., which returns the correct REML estimators and an improved approximation to the standard errors. It is possible to obtain REML estimators by alternating between two generalized linear models but the final fitted generalized linear model objects will not return the correct standard errors for the variance coefficients. The true REML likelihood calculations therefore fit only partially into the double generalized linear model framework.","maximum likelihood,modified profile likelihood,residual maximum likelihood,restricted maximum likelihood,sandwich estimator","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,RESIDUAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,QUASI-LIKELIHOOD,DISPERSION,DIAGNOSTICS,DESIGNS,SERIES","Smyth, Gordon K.@Univ Queensland, Dept Math, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia::Huele, A.

A multivariate generalized linear mixed model for joint modelling of clustered outcomes in the exponential family,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0100100302,OCT 2001,33,54,"Clustered and repeated measures data are very common in biomedical applications, for example when one or more variables are measured on each patient at a number of hospital visits, or when a number of questions are asked at a series of interviews. The Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) can be used for fully parametric subject-specific inference for clustered or repeated measures responses in the exponential family. In this paper a multivariate generalization is proposed to deal with situations when multiple outcome variables in the exponential family are present. Separate GLMM's are assumed for each response variable and then the responses are combined in a single model by imposing a joint multivariate normal distribution for the variable-specific random effects. This allows maximum-likelihood estimation approaches such as Gauss-Hermitian quadrature and Monte Carlo EM algorithm to be extended from the univariate to the multivariate case. Two data sets are used for illustration. The outcome variables are assumed to be conditionally independent given the random effects which is a restrictive assumption in some cases. Score tests for checking this assumption are proposed and alternative models are considered for one of the data examples.","conditional independence,Gaussian quadrature,Monte Carlo EM algorithm,multivariate response,random effects",,"Gueorguieva, R.@Yale Univ, Sch Med, Div Biostat, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Gueorguieva, R.@Yale University","Gueorguieva, Ralitza@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0944-5973","no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS+1972::A model for repeated measurements of a multivariate binary response+Agresti, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::THE MULTIVARIATE POISSON-LOG NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION+AITCHISON, J; HO, CH+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1989::Standard errors of prediction in generalized linear mixed models+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1998::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::BIVARIATE LATENT VARIABLE MODELS FOR CLUSTERED DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES+CATALANO, PJ; RYAN, LM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1992::Bivariate modelling of clustered continuous and ordered categorical outcomes+Catalano, PJ+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 1997::ASYMPTOTIC TESTS OF COMPOSITE HYPOTHESES IN NONSTANDARD CONDITIONS+CHANT, D+BIOMETRIKA+1974::Random effects modeling of multiple binomial responses using the multivariate binomial logit-normal distribution+Coull, BA; Agresti, A+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2000::no title+Doornik, J.+Object-oriented matrix programming using Ox 2.0+1998::Bayesian latent variable models for clustered mixed outcomes+Dunson, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::no title+FAHRMEIR L+MULTIVARIATE STAT MO+1994::REGRESSION-MODELS FOR A BIVARIATE DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS OUTCOME WITH CLUSTERING+FITZMAURICE, GM; LAIRD, NM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1995::A correlated probit model for joint modeling of clustered binary and continuous responses+Gueorguieva, RV; Agresti, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::no title+Gueorguieva, RV.+Models for repeated measures of a multivariate response+1999::The effect of improper priors on Gibbs sampling in hierarchical linear mixed models+Hobert, JP; Casella, G+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::Myoelectric activity of the ileum, cecum, and right ventral colon, and cecal emptying of radiolabeled markers in clinically normal ponies+Lester, GD; Merritt, AM; Neuwirth, L; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH+MAR 1998::Effect of alpha(2)-adrenergic, cholinergic, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on myoelectric activity of ileum, cecum, and right ventral colon and on cecal emptying of radiolabeled markers in clinically normal ponies+Lester, GD; Merritt, AM; Neuwirth, L; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH+MAR 1998::Effect of erythromycin lactobionate on myoelectric activity of ileum, cecum, and right ventral colon, and cecal emptying of radiolabeled markers in clinically normal ponies+Lester, GD; Merritt, AM; Neuwirth, L; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH+MAR 1998::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::Maximum likelihood algorithms for generalized linear mixed models+McCulloch, CE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::A NOTE ON THE EXISTENCE OF THE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION FOR A CLASS OF MIXED MODELS FOR BINOMIAL RESPONSES+NATARAJAN, R; MCCULLOCH, CE+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1995::Approximations to the log-likelihood function-in the nonlinear mixed-effects model+Pinheiro, Jose C; Bates, Douglas M.+Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics+1995::The developmental toxicity of ethylene glycol in rats and mice+Price, CJ; Kimmel, CA; Tyl, RW<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Mart, MC</span>.+Toxicological Applications in Pharmacology+1985::Likelihood models for clustered binary and continuous outcomes: Application to developmental toxicology+Regan, MM; Catalano, PJ+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1999::Analyzing bivariate repeated measures for discrete and continuous outcome variables+Rochon, J+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1996::Latent variable models for mixed discrete and continuous outcomes+Sammel, MD; Ryan, LM; Legler, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1997::no title+Tanner, M.

We present a fully Bayesian B-spline basis function approach with adaptive knot selection. For each of the unknown regression functions or varying coefficients, the number and location of knots and the B-spline coefficients are estimated simultaneously using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The overall procedure can therefore be viewed as a kind of Bayesian model averaging. Although Gaussian responses are covered by the general framework, the method is particularly useful for fundamentally non-Gaussian responses, where less alternatives are available. We illustrate the approach with a thorough application to two data sets analysed previously in the literature: the kyphosis data set with a binary response and survival data from the Veteran's Administration lung cancer trial.","B-spline basis,knot selection: non-Gaussian response,non- and semi-parametric regression,reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo",,"Biller, Clemens@Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Fahrmeir, Ludwig@Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Biller, Clemens@University of Munich::Fahrmeir, Ludwig@University of Munich",not exist,"BAYESIAN COMPUTATION AND STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS+BESAG, J; GREEN, P; HIGDON, D; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 1995::Adaptive Bayesian regression splines in semiparametric generalized linear models+Biller, C+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2000::Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S.+Technical report+2001::no title+De Boor, C.+A Practical Guide to Splines+1978::Automatic Bayesian curve fitting+Denison, DGT; Mallick, BK; Smith, AFM.+Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B+1998::no title+Dierckx, P.+CURVE SURFACE FITTIN+1993::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::no title+Eubank,, R.

Multinomial logit random effects models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0100100201,JUL 2001,67,69,"This article presents a general approach for logit random effects modelling of clustered ordinal and nominal responses. We review multinomial logit random effects models in a unified form as multivariate generalized linear mixed models. Maximum likelihood estimation utilizes adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature within a quasi-Newton maximization algorithm. For cases in which this is computationally infeasible, we generalize a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. We also generalize a pseudo-likelihood approach that is simpler but provides poorer approximations for the likelihood. Besides the usual normality structure for random effects, we also present a semi-parametric approach treating the random effects in a non-parametric manner. An example comparing reviews of movie critics uses adjacent-categories logit models and a related baseline-category logit model.","adjacent-categories logit,baseline-category logit,generalized linear mixed model,nominal variable,non-parametric maximum likelihood,ordinal variable,quasi symmetry",,"Hartzel, Jonathan@Merck Res Labs, West Point, PA USA::Agresti, Alan@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Caffo, Brian@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Hartzel, Jonathan@Merck & Company::Agresti, Alan@University of Florida@State University System of Florida::Caffo, Brian@University of Florida@State University System of Florida",not exist,"The multidimensional random coefficients multinomial logit model+Adams, J; Wilson, M; Wang, W.+Applied Psychological Measurement+1997::Formulating the Rasch model as a mixed coefficients multinomial logit+Adams, RJ; Wilson, MR.+Objective measurement: theory and practice+1996::Random effects modeling of multiple binary responses using the multivariate binomial logit-normal distribution+Agresti, A; Coull, B.+Biometrics+2000::COMPUTING CONDITIONAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATES FOR GENERALIZED RASCH MODELS USING SIMPLE LOGLINEAR MODELS WITH DIAGONALS PARAMETERS+AGRESTI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1993::A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::A general maximum likelihood analysis of overdispersion in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+SEP 1996::VARIANCE COMPONENT MODELS WITH BINARY RESPONSE - INTERVIEWER VARIABILITY+ANDERSON, DA; AITKIN, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1985::ESTIMATING ITEM PARAMETERS AND LATENT ABILITY WHEN RESPONSES ARE SCORED IN 2 OR MORE NOMINAL CATEGORIES+BOCK, RD+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1972::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::EXTRA-POISSON VARIATION IN LOG-LINEAR MODELS+BRESLOW, NE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1984::no title+Bryk, AS; Raudenbush, SW; Congdon, R.+HLM version 5+2000::Consistency of maximum likelihood estimators in general random effects models for binary data+Butler, SM; Louis, TA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 1997::RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS WITH NONPARAMETRIC PRIORS+BUTLER, SM; LOUIS, TA+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT-NOV 1992::A note on the estimation of the multinomial logit model with random effects+Chen, Z; Kuo, L+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2001::INVESTIGATING HETEROGENEITY IN BRAND PREFERENCES IN LOGIT-MODELS FOR PANEL DATA+CHINTAGUNTA, PK; JAIN, DC; VILCASSIM, NJ+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+NOV 1991::A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL FOR BINARY DATA+CONAWAY, MR+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1990::ANALYSIS OF REPEATED CATEGORICAL MEASUREMENTS WITH CONDITIONAL LIKELIHOOD METHODS+CONAWAY, MR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1989::A RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL FOR ORDERED CATEGORICAL-DATA+CROUCHLEY, R+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::Hierarchical polytomous regression models with applications to health services research+Daniels, MJ; Gatsonis, C+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT 30 1997::THE NONLINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODEL WITH A SMOOTH RANDOM EFFECTS DENSITY+DAVIDIAN, M; GALLANT, AR+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1993::no title+DAVIES RB+LONGITUDINAL DATA AN+1987::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::A continuation ratio random effects model for repeated ordinal responses+Dos Santos, DM; Berridge, DM+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2000::A simple illustration of the failure of PQL, IRREML and APHL as approximate ML methods for mixed models for binary data+Engel, B+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1998::A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL FOR ORDINAL RESPONSES FROM A CROSSOVER TRIAL+EZZET, F; WHITEHEAD, J+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 1991::no title+Fahrmeir, L.; Tutz, G.+Multivariate statistical modelling based on generalized linear models+2001::IDENTIFIABILITY OF FINITE MIXTURES OF LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS+FOLLMANN, DA; LAMBERT, D+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1991::GENERALIZING LOGISTIC-REGRESSION BY NONPARAMETRIC MIXING+FOLLMANN, DA; LAMBERT, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1989::no title+Geweke, J.+Handbook of computational statistics+1996::THE ANALYSIS OF BINOMIAL DATA BY A GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODEL+GILMOUR, AR; ANDERSON, RD; RAE, AL+BIOMETRIKA+1985::no title+GOLDSTEIN H+USERS GUIDE MLWIN+1998::MODELING MULTIPLE SOURCES OF HETEROGENEITY IN MULTINOMIAL LOGIT-MODELS - METHODOLOGICAL AND MANAGERIAL ISSUES+GONUL, F; SRINIVASAN, K+MARKETING SCIENCE+SUM 1993::no title+Greene, W.

Multiple membership multiple classification (MMMC) models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0100100202,JUL 2001,34,173,"In the social and other sciences many data are collected with a known but complex underlying structure. Over the past two decades there has been an increase in the use of multilevel modelling techniques that account for nested data structures. Often however the underlying data structures are more complex and cannot be fitted into a nested structure. First, there are cross-classified models where the classifications in the data are not nested. Secondly, we consider multiple membership models where an observation does not belong simply to one member of a classification. These two extensions when combined allow us to fit models to a large array of underlying structures. Existing frequentist modelling approaches to fitting such data have some important computational limitations. In this paper we consider ways of overcoming such limitations using Bayesian methods, since Bayesian model fitting is easily accomplished using Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) techniques. In examples where we have been able to make direct comparisons, Bayesian methods in conjunction with suitable 'diffuse' prior distributions lead to similar inferences to existing frequentist techniques. In this paper we illustrate our techniques with examples in the fields of education, veterinary epidemiology, demography, and public health illustrating the diversity of models that fit into our framework.","multilevel modelling,hierarchical modelling,Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC),cross-classified models,multiple membership models,complex data structures,Bayesian GLMM modelling",,"Browne, William J.@Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1 0AL, England::Goldstein, Harvey@Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1 0AL, England::Rasbash, Jon@Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1 0AL, England","Browne, William J.@University College London@University of London::Goldstein, Harvey@University College London@University of London::Rasbash, Jon@University College London@University of London","Goldstein, Harvey@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3878-4122","BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Implementation and performance issues in the Bayesian and likelihood fitting of multilevel models+Browne, WJ; Draper, D+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2000::Bayesian and likelihood methods for fitting multilevel models with complex level-1 variation+Browne, WJ; Draper, D; Goldstein, H<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rasbash, J</span>.+Computational Statistics and Data Analysis+2001::no title+Bryk, A.S; Raudenbush, S.W.+Hierarchical linear models for social and behavioral research: Application and data analysis methods+1992::no title+BRYK AS+INTRO HLM COMPUTER P+1988::EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATES OF AGE-STANDARDIZED RELATIVE RISKS FOR USE IN DISEASE MAPPING+CLAYTON, D; KALDOR, J+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1987::Estimation in large crossed random-effect models by data augmentation+Clayton, D; Rasbash, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1999::Generalized linear mixed models+Clayton, D.

In response to these concerns, there is growing awareness of the usefulness of sensitivity analysis. In this paper we will focus on repeated ordinal data.

We find that changes in southern hemisphere temperatures lead to changes in northern hemisphere temperatures, with no evidence of feedback, in both types of model. Where the models differ is that the assumption of stochastic linear trends leads to a common trend with constant growth throughout the sample period, whereas with deterministic non-linear trends there are divergent trend growth paths in the two hemispheres after the early part of the twentieth century.","global temperature,trends,cointegration,smooth transitions",,"Harvey, David I.@Univ Loughborough, Dept Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England::Mills, Terence C.@Univ Loughborough, Dept Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England","Harvey, David I.@Loughborough University::Mills, Terence C.@Loughborough University","Harvey, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7504-6885","ESTIMATING TRANSITION BETWEEN 2 INTERSECTING STRAIGHT LINES+BACON, DW; WATTS, DG+BIOMETRIKA+1971::CLIMATE SPECTRA AND DETECTING CLIMATE CHANGE+BLOOMFIELD, P; NYCHKA, D+CLIMATIC CHANGE+JUL 1992::DISTRIBUTION OF THE ESTIMATORS FOR AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES WITH A UNIT ROOT+DICKEY, DA; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::INFERENCE ABOUT TRENDS IN GLOBAL TEMPERATURE DATA+GALBRAITH, JW; GREEN, C+CLIMATIC CHANGE+NOV 1992::GLOBAL TRENDS OF MEASURED SURFACE AIR-TEMPERATURE+HANSEN, J; LEBEDEFF, S+JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES+NOV 20 1987::no title+Johansen, S.+Likelihood-based inference in Cointegrated vector autoregressive models+1995::Hemispheric surface air temperature variations: a reanalysis and an update to 1993+Jones, PD.+Journal of Climate+1994::QUANTILE SPLINE MODELS FOR GLOBAL TEMPERATURE-CHANGE+KOENKER, R; SCHORFHEIDE, F+CLIMATIC CHANGE+DEC 1994::Unit Roots and Smooth Transitions+Leybourne, S.; Newbold, P.; Vougas, D.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1998::TESTING THE CONSTANCY OF REGRESSION PARAMETERS AGAINST CONTINUOUS STRUCTURAL-CHANGE+LIN, CFJ; TERASVIRTA, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 1994::Unit roots and double smooth transitions+Mills, TC; Harvey, DI.+Journal of Applied Statistics+2001::no title+MILLS, TERENCE C.+ECONOMETRIC MODELLIN+1999::UNIT-ROOT TESTS IN ARMA MODELS WITH DATA-DEPENDENT METHODS FOR THE SELECTION OF THE TRUNCATION LAG+NG, S; PERRON, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1995::Marine surface temperature: Observed variations and data requirements+Parker, DE; Folland, CK; Jackson, M+CLIMATIC CHANGE+DEC 1995::Interdecadal changes of surface air temperature since the late 19th century+Parker, DE; Jones, PD; Bevan, A<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Folland, CK</span>.+Journal of Geophysical Research+1994::THE GREAT CRASH, THE OIL PRICE SHOCK, AND THE UNIT-ROOT HYPOTHESIS+PERRON, P+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1989::A primer on unit root testing+Phillips, P.

A hierarchical Bayesian model for space-time variation of disease risk,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0100100103,APR 2001,20,24,"In this paper we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model to study the variation in space and time of disease risk. We represent spatial effects following the usual Bayesian specification of a Gaussian convolution of unstructured and structured components, while we adopt the birth cohort (instead of the commonly used period of death) as the main time scale. The model also includes space-time interaction terms to take into account structured inseparable space-time variability. The model is applied to lung cancer death certificate data in Tuscany, for males during the period 1971-94. While a calendar period analysis points out a general increase of mortality levelling off in the last period (1990-94), the cohort model shows a general and substantial decrease of the relative risk for the youngest cohorts born after 1930. Moreover, the pattern of the epidemic by birth cohort presents a maximum which varies by municipalities, with a strong north-west/south-east gradient.","cohort effects,hierarchiical Bayesian model,space-time analysis",,"Lagazio, Corrado@Univ Udine, Dept Stat Sci, I-33100 Udine, Italy::Dreassi, Emanuela@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, Florence, Italy::Biggeri, Annibale@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, Florence, Italy","Lagazio, Corrado@University of Udine::Dreassi, Emanuela@University of Florence::Biggeri, Annibale@University of Florence",not exist,"no title+Assuncao, RM; Reis, IA; Di Lorenzo Oliveira, C.+Diffusion and prediction of Leishmaniasis in a large metropolitan area in Brazil with a Bayesian space-time model+2000::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF SPACE-TIME VARIATION IN DISEASE RISK+BERNARDINELLI, L; CLAYTON, D; PASCUTTO, C; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 15 1995::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::Generalized linear mixed models+Clayton, D.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice+1996::MODELS FOR TEMPORAL VARIATION IN CANCER RATES .1.

Sensitivity analysis for incomplete categorical data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0100100104,APR 2001,26,38,"Classical inferential procedures induce conclusions from a set of data to a population of interest, accounting for the imprecision resulting from the stochastic component of the model. This is usually done by means of precision or interval estimates. Less attention is devoted to the uncertainty arising from (unplanned) incompleteness in the data, even though the majority of clinical studies suffer from incomplete follow-up. Through the choice of an identifiable model for non-ignorable non-response, one narrows the possible data generating mechanisms to the point where inference only suffers from imprecision. Some proposals have been made for assessment of sensitivity to these modelling assumptions; many are based on fitting several plausible but competing models. We propose a formal approach which identifies and incorporates both sources of uncertainty in inference: imprecision due to finite sampling and ignorance due to incompleteness. The developments focus on contingency tables, and are illustrated using data from a HIV prevalence study and data from a psychiatric study.","contingency table,missing at random,overspecified model,saturated model",,"Kenward, Michael G.@Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, England::Goetghebeur, Els J.

Binormal association-marginal models for empirically evaluating and comparing diagnostics,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0100100105,APR 2001,35,0,"A new method for empirically evaluating and comparing two diagnostics is introduced. Specifically, correlated ordinal rating data from a paired-comparison study are modelled using a flexible, new class of binormal association-marginal (BAM) models. Among other things, these models, which are fitted via maximum likelihood (ML), afford efficient estimators of (i) the diagnostics' receiver operating characteristic curves and (ii) the level of manifest agreement between the diagnostics. BAM models use the latent binormal structure of classic signal detection theory to model each ordinal response marginal distribution. In contrast to bivariate binormal models, BAM models do not impose the added restriction that the ordinal responses have joint distributions that are determined by latent bivariate normal distributions. Instead, the association structure of the ordinal variables is directly specified using standard loglinear models. An ML fitting algorithm, which is related to those algorithms used to fit composite-link generalized linear marginal models, is introduced.

Analyzing the emergence times of permanent teeth: an example of modeling the covariance matrix with interval-censored data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082006071844,DEC 2006,36,6,"Based on a data set obtained in a large dental longitudinal study, conducted in Flanders (Belgium), the joint emergence distribution of seven teeth was modeled as a function of gender and caries experience on primary teeth. Besides establishing the marginal dependence of emergence on the covariates, there was also interest in examining the impact of the covariates on the association among emergence times. This allows the establishment of the preferred rankings of emergence and their dependence on covariates. To this end, the covariance matrix was modeled as a function of covariates. Modeling the covariance matrix in this way needs to ensure the positive definiteness of the covariance matrix and it is preferable that the regression parameters of the model are interpretable. The modified Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix, as suggested by Pourahmadi, splits up the covariance matrix into two parts where the parameters can be interpreted, given a natural ranking of the responses. This approach was used here taking into account that the emergence times are interval-censored. Hence, we opted for a Bayesian implementation of the data augmentation algorithm.","bivariate survival,covariance matrix,data augmentation,emergence times,interval-censored,multivariate normality","LONGITUDINAL DATA,MONTE-CARLO,ERUPTION,CHILDREN,MOLARS,CARIES","Cecere, Silvia@Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Jara, Alejandro@Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Lesaffre, Emmanuel@Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Cecere, Silvia@Universite Catholique Louvain::Jara, Alejandro@Universite Catholique Louvain::Lesaffre, Emmanuel@Universite Catholique Louvain",not exist,"EFFECT OF SOME ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON SEQUENCE OF PERMANENT TOOTH ERUPTION+ADLER, P+JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH+1963::Modeling covariance matrices in terms of standard deviations and correlations, with application to shrinkage+Barnard, J; McCulloch, R; Meng, XL+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2000::no title+BOGAERTS K+ESTIMATING MEASURES+2006::Modelling Tooth Emergence Data Based on Multivariate Interval Censored-Data+Bogaerts, K.; Leroy, R.; Declerck, D.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lesaffre, E</span>.+Statistics in Medicine+2002::Bayesian and likelihood methods for fitting multilevel models with complex level-1 variation+Browne, WJ; Draper, D; Goldstein, H; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 28 2002::no title+Carlin, B.

Bayesian modeling for genetic association in case-control studies: accounting for unknown population substructure,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082006071841,DEC 2006,26,6,"A two-stage parametric Bayesian method is proposed to examine the association between a candidate gene and the occurrence of a disease after accounting for population substructure. This procedure, implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo numerical integration technique, first estimates the posterior probability of different unknown population substructures and then integrates this information into a disease-gene association model through the technique of Bayesian model averaging. The model relaxes certain assumptions of previous analyses and provides a unified computational framework to obtain an estimate of the log odds ratio parameter corresponding to the genetic factor after allowing for the allele frequencies to vary across subpopulations. The uncertainty in estimating the population substructure is taken into account while providing credible intervals for parameters in the disease-gene association model. Simulations on unmatched case-control studies that mimic an admixed Argentinean population are performed to demonstrate the statistical properties of our model. The method is also applied to a real data set coming from a genetic association study on obesity.","Bayesian model averaging,gene-disease association,linkage equilibrium,Markov chain Monte Carlo,obesity","MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA,ALLELE FREQUENCIES,DIABETES-MELLITUS,COMPLEX TRAITS,ADMIXTURE,POLYMORPHISMS,INFERENCE,LINKAGE,LOCI","Zhang, Li@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Mukherjee, Bhramar@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Ghosh, Malay@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Wu, Rongling@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Zhang, Li@University of Florida@State University System of Florida::Mukherjee, Bhramar@University of Florida@State University System of Florida::Ghosh, Malay@University of Florida@State University System of Florida::Wu, Rongling@University of Florida@State University System of Florida",not exist,"no title+*COMM DNA FOR SCI+UPD EV FOR DNA EV+1996::Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data: Linked loci and correlated allele frequencies+Falush, D; Stephens, M; Pritchard, JK+GENETICS+AUG 2003::Assessing the impact of population stratification on genetic association studies+Freedman, ML; Reich, D; Penney, KL; et al.+NATURE GENETICS+APR 2004::Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly polymorphisms of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor gene are not associated with obesity in Japanese men+Hayakawa, T; Nagai, Y; Kahara, T; et al.+METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL+SEP 2000::Design and analysis of admixture mapping studies+Hoggart, CJ; Shriver, MD; Kittles, RA; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+MAY 2004::Control of confounding of genetic associations in stratified populations+Hoggart, CJ; Parra, EJ; Shriver, MD; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+JUN 2003::beta-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms: Cardiovascular disease associations and pharmacogenetics+Johnson, JA; Terra, SG+PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH+DEC 2002::GM3-5,13,14 AND TYPE-2 DIABETES-MELLITUS - AN ASSOCIATION IN AMERICAN-INDIANS WITH GENETIC ADMIXTURE+KNOWLER, WC; WILLIAMS, RC; PETTITT, DJ; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+OCT 1988::GENETIC DISSECTION OF COMPLEX TRAITS+LANDER, ES; SCHORK, NJ+SCIENCE+SEP 30 1994::Sequencing drug response with HapMap+Lin, M; Aquilante, C; Johnson, JA; et al.+PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL+2005::no title+LYNCH M+GENETICS ANAL QUANIT+1998::MODEL SELECTION AND ACCOUNTING FOR MODEL UNCERTAINTY IN GRAPHICAL MODELS USING OCCAMS WINDOW+MADIGAN, D; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1994::The effects of human population structure on large genetic association studies+Marchini, J; Cardon, LR; Phillips, MS; et al.+NATURE GENETICS+MAY 2004::Prospects for admixture mapping of complex traits+McKeigue, PM+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+JAN 2005::Tests and estimates of allelic association in complex inheritance+Morton, NE; Collins, A+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+SEP 15 1998::Methods for high-density admixture mapping of disease genes+Patterson, N; Hattangadi, N; Lane, B; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+MAY 2004::Association mapping in structured populations+Pritchard, JK; Stephens, M; Rosenberg, NA; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+JUL 2000::Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data+Pritchard, JK; Stephens, M; Donnelly, P+GENETICS+JUN 2000::The future of genetic studies of complex human diseases+Risch, N; Merikangas, K+SCIENCE+SEP 13 1996::Reference database of hypervariable genetic markers of Argentina: Application for molecular anthropology and forensic casework+Sala, A; Penacino, G; Carnese, R; et al.+ELECTROPHORESIS+JUN 1999::Comparison of allele frequencies of eight STR loci from Argentinian Amerindian and European populations+Sala, A; Penacino, G; Corach, D+HUMAN BIOLOGY+OCT 1998::Accounting for unmeasured population substructure in case-control studies of genetic association using a novel latent-class model+Satten, GA; Flanders, WD; Yang, QH+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+FEB 2001::A sibship test for linkage in the presence of association: The sib transmission/disequilibrium test+Spielman, RS; Ewens, WJ+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+FEB 1998::TRANSMISSION TEST FOR LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM - THE INSULIN GENE REGION AND INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES-MELLITUS (IDDM)+SPIELMAN, RS; MCGINNIS, RE; EWENS, WJ+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+MAR 1993::Genetic case-control association studies in neuropsychiatry+Sullivan, PF; Eaves, LJ; Kendler, KS; et al.+ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY+NOV 2001::no title+TAKAMI S+AM J PHYSIOL-HEART C+1999"
Quantile regression with monotonicity restrictions using P-splines and the L-1-norm,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st118oa,OCT 2006,20,18,"Quantile regression is an alternative to OLS regression. In quantile regression, the sum of absolute deviations or the L-1-norm is minimized, whereas the sum of squared deviations or the L-2-norm is minimized in OLS regression. Quantile regression has the advantage over OLS-regression of being more robust to outlying observations. Furthermore, quantile regression provides information complementing the information provided by OLS-regression. In this study, a non-parametric approach to quantile regression is presented, which constrains the estimated-quanti le function to be monotone increasing. In particular, P-splines with an additional asymmetric penalty enforcing monotonicity are used within an L-1-framework. This can be translated into a linear programming problem, which will be solved using an interior point algorithm. As an illustration, the presented approach will be applied to estimate quantile growth curves and quantile antibody levels as a function of age.","growth curves,interior point,L-1-norm,monotonicity,P-splines,quantile regression",DERIVATIVES,"Bollaerts, Kaatje@Univ Hasselt, Ctr Stat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Eilers, Paul H.

The distribution is defined by a power transformation Y-nu having a shifted and scaled (truncated) t distribution with degrees of freedom parameter tau. The distribution has four parameters and is denoted by BCT(mu, sigma, nu, tau). The parameters mu, sigma, nu and tau may be interpreted as relating to location (median), scale (centile-based coefficient of variation), skewness (power transformation to symmetry) and kurtosis (degrees of freedom), respectively. The generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) is extended to allow each of the parameters of the distribution to be modelled as linear and/or non-linear parametric and/or smooth non-parametric functions of explanatory variables. A Fisher scoring algorithm is used to fit the model by maximizing a (penalized) likelihood. The first and expected second and cross derivatives of the likelihood with respect to mu, sigma, nu and tau, required for the algorithm, are provided.

A Bayesian approach to inequality constrained linear mixed models: estimation and model selection,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st119oa,OCT 2006,30,9,Constrained parameter problems arise in a wide variety of applications. This article deals with estimation and model selection in linear mixed models with inequality constraints on the parameters. It is shown that different theories can be translated into statistical models by putting constraints on the model parameters yielding a set of competing models.

Modelling repeated ordinal reports from multiple informants,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st121oa,OCT 2006,20,4,"Cross-informant associations tend to be low for reports of children's behaviours at one point in time. The paper extends the literature on multiple informants using data from a well-known longitudinal study of Quebec, Canada, boys to show how to estimate associations between repeated teachers' and self-reports of aggressive behaviour. These associations, for both level and change, are derived from multilevel models for repeated measures of variables best treated as ordered categories. The ordering is represented by sets of continuation ratios, change by linear and quadratic functions of age, and the multivariate models are estimated using penalized quasi-likelihood. The analyses also incorporate a risk variable: socio-economic status (SES). The correlations between estimates of the growth parameters for the two sets of reports tend to be rather small and smaller than the cross-informant associations for levels. SES is associated with levels of aggression, more so for teacher reports than for self-reports, but not with the decline in aggression with age.","continuation ratios,multilevel models,multiple informants,psychological development,repeated measures,risk variables","ANALYZING DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES,BEHAVIOR,SCHOOL","Plewis, Ian@Univ London, Inst Educ, Bedford Grp Lifecourse & Stat Sci, London WC1H 0AL, England@Univ Montreal, GRIP, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada::Vitaro, Frank@Univ London, Inst Educ, Bedford Grp Lifecourse & Stat Sci, London WC1H 0AL, England@Univ Montreal, GRIP, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada::Trernblay, Richard@Univ London, Inst Educ, Bedford Grp Lifecourse & Stat Sci, London WC1H 0AL, England@Univ Montreal, GRIP, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada","Plewis, Ian@University College London@University of London@University of Montreal::Vitaro, Frank@University College London@University of London@University of Montreal::Trernblay, Richard@University College London@University of London@University of Montreal",not exist,"CHILD ADOLESCENT BEHAVIORAL AND EMOTIONAL-PROBLEMS - IMPLICATIONS OF CROSS-INFORMANT CORRELATIONS FOR SITUATIONAL SPECIFICITY+ACHENBACH, TM; MCCONAUGHY, SH; HOWELL, CT+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+MAR 1987::Developmental trajectories of physical aggression from school entry to late adolescence+Brame, B; Nagin, DS; Tremblay, RE+JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY AND ALLIED DISCIPLINES+MAY 2001::no title+BROWNE WJ+MCMC ESTIMATION MLWI+2004::A case study on the choice, interpretation and checking of multilevel models for longitudinal binary outcomes.+Carlin, J B; Wolfe, R; Brown, C H; et al.+Biostatistics (Oxford, England)+2001-Dec::no title+Fienberg, S.

Generalization of the Weibull distribution: the odd Weibull family,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st116oa,OCT 2006,13,19,"A three-parameter generalization of the Weibull distribution is presented to deal with general situations in modeling survival process with various shapes in the hazard function. This generalized Weibull distribution will be referred to as the odd Weibull family, as it is derived by considering the distributions of the odds of the Weibull and inverse Weibull families. As a result, the odd Weibull family is not only useful for testing goodness-of-fit of the Weibull and inverse Weibull as submodels, but it is also convenient for modeling and fitting different data sets, especially in the presence of censoring. The model parameters for uncensored data are estimated in two different ways because of the fact that the inverse transformation of the odd Weibull family does not change its density function. Adequacy of the model for the given uncensored data is illustrated by using the plot of scaled fitted total time on test (TTT) transforms. Furthermore, simulation studies are conducted to measure the discrepancy between empirical and fitted TTT transforms by using a previously proposed test statistic. Three different examples are, respectively, provided based on data from survival, reliability and environmental sciences to illustrate increasing, bathtub and unimodal failure rates.","confidence band,goodness-of-fit,maximum likelihood,total time on test transform",,"Cooray, Kahadawala@Univ Nevada, Dept Math Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA","Cooray, Kahadawala@University of Nevada Las Vegas@Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE)",not exist,"HOW TO IDENTIFY A BATHTUB HAZARD RATE+AARSET, MV+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+APR 1987::Total time on test processes and applications to failure data analysis+Barlow, R.

Binomial thinning models for integer time series,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st114oa,JUL 2006,31,23,"This article considers some simple observation-driven time series models for counts. We provide a brief description of the class of integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) and integer-valued moving average (INMA) processes. These classes of models may be attractive when the data exhibit a significant serial dependence structure. We, therefore, briefly review various testing procedures useful for assessing the serial correlation in the data. Once it is established that the data are not serially independent, suitable INAR or INMA processes may be employed to model the data. in the important first order INAR model, we discuss various methods of estimating the structural parameters of the process. We also give a short account of the extension of some of these estimation procedures to second order INAR models. Moving average counterparts of both models are also entertained. Throughout, the models and methods are illustrated in the context of a famous data set from the branching process literature that turns out to be surprisingly difficult to model satisfactorily.","time series of counts,INAR and INMA models,parameter estimates,assessing dependence","IMMIGRATION,AUTOREGRESSION,COUNTS","Jung, Robert C.@Univ Tubingen, Wirtschaftswissensch Fak, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia@Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England::Tremayne, A.

Estimation and filtering by reversible jump MCMC for a doubly stochastic Poisson model for ultra-high-frequency financial data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st112oa,JUL 2006,27,10,"We propose a modeling framework for ultra-high-frequency data on financial asset price movements. The models proposed belong to the class of the doubly stochastic Poisson processes with marks and allow an interpretation of the changes in price volatility and trading activity in terms of news or information arrival. Assuming that the intensity process underlying event arrivals is unobserved by market agents, we propose a signal extraction (filtering) method based on the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Moreover, given a realization of the price process, inference on the parameters can be performed by appealing to stochastic versions of the expectation-maximization algorithm. The simulation methods proposed will be applied to the computation of hedging strategies and derivative prices.","intraday data,marked point processes,news arrival,option pricing,stochastic EM algorithm","EM ALGORITHM,INFORMATION,VOLATILITY,MARKETS","Centanni, S.@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06100 Perugia, Italy::Minozzo, M.@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06100 Perugia, Italy","Centanni, S.@University of Perugia::Minozzo, M.@University of Perugia",not exist,"Non-Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-based models and some of their uses in financial economics+Barndorff-Nielsen, OE; Shephard, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::no title+CELEUX G+2514 I NAT RECH INF+1995::The SEM algorithm: A probabilisitic teacher algorithm derived from the EM algorithm for the mixture+Celeux, G.; Diebolt, J.+Computational Statistics Quarterly+1985::no title+CENTANNI S+RAPPORTI SCI AMASES+2005::no title+CENTANNI S+THESIS U PERUGIA+2003::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::The econometrics of ultra-high-frequency data+Engle, RF+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2000::Autoregressive conditional duration: A new model for irregularly spaced transaction data+Engle, RF; Russell, JR+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 1998::MEASURING AND TESTING THE IMPACT OF NEWS ON VOLATILITY+ENGLE, RF; NG, VK+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+DEC 1993::no title+FOLLMER H+CONTRIBUTIONS MATH E+1986::Quantile hedging+Follmer, H.; Leukert, P.+Finance and Stochastics+1999::A nonlinear filtering approach to volatility estimation with a view towards high frequency data+Frey, R.; Runggaldier, W.

Handling dropout and clustering in longitudinal multicentre clinical trials,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st113oa,JUL 2006,34,4,"Many clinical trials enrol patients from different medical centres. Multi-centre studies are particularly helpful in cancer research as they allow researchers to evaluate the efficacy of a therapy in a variety of patients and settings, making it possible to investigate the effect of treatments in those cases when it is difficult, or even impossible, for a single centre to recruit the required number of patients. It is often argued, however, that despite agreement among different centres to follow common standardized protocols, variation may occur in both baseline characteristics of the recruited patients and in treatment effects. This heterogeneity should be detected and, if present, accounted for in the data analysis. Furthermore, the longitudinal nature of these types of experimental studies raises the problem of attrition, that is, patients may dropout of the study for a number of reasons mainly death or disease progression. In this paper, we consider the health related quality of life of advanced melanoma patients in a longitudinal multi-centre randomized clinical trial comparing two different anti-tumoural treatments. We propose a Heckman type model to account for the possibility that patients dropout according to a non-ignorable mechanism. The model is extended to a multilevel setting to account both for the longitudinal nature and the multi-centre structure of the design. We found a strong variation across centres in the quality of life evaluation. The effect of centres on the dropout was not found to be relevant in the considered data although dropout does depend on patient's characteristics.","quality of life,Heckman selection model,multilevel models,not ignorable dropout","QUALITY-OF-LIFE,SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS,SURVIVAL-DATA,MODELS,NORMALITY","Del Bianco, P.@Ist Oncol Veneto, Clin Trials & Biostat Unit, I-35128 Padua, Italy@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, Milan, Italy::Borgoni, R.@Ist Oncol Veneto, Clin Trials & Biostat Unit, I-35128 Padua, Italy@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, Milan, Italy","Del Bianco, P.@IRCCS Istituto Oncologico Veneto (IOV)@University of Milano-Bicocca::Borgoni, R.@IRCCS Istituto Oncologico Veneto (IOV)@University of Milano-Bicocca","Del Bianco, Paola@F-4655-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6597-0265","no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS+1972::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF CENSORED SELECTION MODELS WITH A NONPARAMETRIC SELECTION MECHANISM+AHN, H; POWELL, JL+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1993::no title+Allison, P.

Space-cohort Bayesian models in ecological studies,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st111oa,JUL 2006,28,10,"The ecological association between 'low educational level' and lung cancer mortality, both recorded at municipality level, is investigated. Six birth cohorts were retained from 1905 to 1940. Education data were derived from censuses of the period 1921-91. The education score was defined as prevalence of less educated people and was measured on a relative scale, defining a different threshold for 'low educational level' at each census. Four potentially relevant ages at first exposure were defined (20, 30, 40, 50) to explore the temporal pattern of the disease. Thus, mortality in each cohort was matched to relative education at different periods corresponding to different ages at first exposure. The relevance of each age at first exposure and the degree of association between education and lung cancer mortality (males, Tuscany, 1971-99) were evaluated, defining a set of hierarchical Bayesian models, each corresponding to a different aetiologic hypothesis. Results show an inverse relationship between low education score and mortality for lung cancer, whose intensity decreases by cohort and becomes positive in the last one. This association was more evident for age at first exposure in the range 20-30 years. These results are consistent with the epidemiological transition of risk factors among socioeconomic classes and are coherent with the biological model of initiating carcinogen agents.","birth cohort,disease mapping,lung cancer,hierarchical space-time Bayesian models,time-dependent covariates","LUNG-CANCER MORTALITY,AGE-PERIOD,EPIDEMIOLOGY,VARIABLES,RATES","Catelan, Dolores@Univ Udine, Dept Stat Sci, I-33100 Udine, Italy@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, Florence, Italy@CSPO, Biostat Unit, Florence, Italy::Biggeri, Annibale@Univ Udine, Dept Stat Sci, I-33100 Udine, Italy@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, Florence, Italy@CSPO, Biostat Unit, Florence, Italy::Dreassi, Ernanuela@Univ Udine, Dept Stat Sci, I-33100 Udine, Italy@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, Florence, Italy@CSPO, Biostat Unit, Florence, Italy::Lagazio, Corrado@Univ Udine, Dept Stat Sci, I-33100 Udine, Italy@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, Florence, Italy@CSPO, Biostat Unit, Florence, Italy","Catelan, Dolores@University of Udine@University of Florence@Unknow::Biggeri, Annibale@University of Udine@University of Florence@Unknow::Dreassi, Ernanuela@University of Udine@University of Florence@Unknow::Lagazio, Corrado@University of Udine@University of Florence@Unknow",not exist,"Epidemiology of lung cancer: Looking to the future+Alberg, AJ; Brock, MV; Samet, JM+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+MAY 10 2005::THE AGE DISTRIBUTION OF CANCER AND A MULTI-STAGE THEORY OF CARCINOGENESIS+ARMITAGE, P; DOLL, R+BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER+1954::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::INDIRECT STANDARDIZATION AND MULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR RATES, WITH REFERENCE TO AGE ADJUSTMENT OF CANCER INCIDENCE AND RELATIVE FREQUENCY DATA+BRESLOW, NE; DAY, NE+JOURNAL OF CHRONIC DISEASES+1975::no title+CARSTAIRS V+J EPIDEMIOL COMMU S2+1995::no title+CAVELAARS AE+BRIT MED J+2000::EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATES OF AGE-STANDARDIZED RELATIVE RISKS FOR USE IN DISEASE MAPPING+CLAYTON, D; KALDOR, J+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1987::Generalized linear mixed models+Clayton, D.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice+1996::MODELS FOR TEMPORAL VARIATION IN CANCER RATES .1.

A hierarchical Bayesian model for a variability analysis of measurements of occupational n-hexane exposure in Italy,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st110oa,JUL 2006,14,0,"This study evaluates changes over time in occupational exposure to n-hexane by longitudinal repeated measurements analysis of data from the Biological Monitoring Registry from 1991 to 1998. The main sources of variability in n-hexane exposure among manufacturing workers in Florence province (Italy) are inspected. The 2,5-hexanedione concentrations in urine of industrial workers are explained by structural, individual and factory information. Here we analyse the effectiveness of a 1994 law on workplace conditions based on variability decomposition of measured 2,5-hexanedione concentrations.

We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model which takes into account the different levels of aggregation of data. The results show that for leather and shoe factories, the within-subject and within-factory variance components remain the most important over the time of study, whereas the between-factory components decreased in accordance with the expected effect of the new legislation.","hierarchical Bayesian model,measurements variability,occupational exposure","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,METABOLITES","Toti, Simona@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, I-50134 Florence, Italy@CSPO, Biostat Unit, Florence, Italy@ASF, SA Epidemiol, Florence, Italy::Biggeri, Annibale@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, I-50134 Florence, Italy@CSPO, Biostat Unit, Florence, Italy@ASF, SA Epidemiol, Florence, Italy::Baldasseroni, Alberto@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, I-50134 Florence, Italy@CSPO, Biostat Unit, Florence, Italy@ASF, SA Epidemiol, Florence, Italy","Toti, Simona@University of Florence@Unknow@Unknow::Biggeri, Annibale@University of Florence@Unknow@Unknow::Baldasseroni, Alberto@University of Florence@Unknow@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Arlien-Soborg, P.+Solvent Neurotoxicity+1992::Occupational exposure to n-hexane in Italy - analysis of a registry of biological monitoring+Baldasseroni, A; Bavazzano, P; Buiatti, E; et al.+INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH+MAY 2003::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+DIGGLE PJ+LONGITUDINAL DATA AN+1994::EFFICIENT PARAMETRIZATIONS FOR NORMAL LINEAR MIXED MODELS+GELFAND, AE; SAHU, SK; CARLIN, BP+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1995::no title+GELMAN AJ+IN PRESS BAYESIAN AN+2006::no title+Gilks, W.; Richardson, S.; Spiegelhalter, D.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice+1996::A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF WITHIN-WORKER AND BETWEEN-WORKER COMPONENTS OF OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO CHEMICAL-AGENTS+KROMHOUT, H; SYMANSKI, E; RAPPAPORT, SM+ANNALS OF OCCUPATIONAL HYGIENE+JUN 1993::IDENTIFICATION OF THE METABOLITES OF NORMAL-HEXANE, CYCLOHEXANE, AND THEIR ISOMERS IN MENS URINE+PERBELLINI, L; BRUGNONE, F; PAVAN, I+TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY+1980::Retrospective exposure assessment using Bayesian methods+Ramachandran, G+ANNALS OF OCCUPATIONAL HYGIENE+NOV 2001::no title+Spiegelhalter, D.

Bayesian semi-parametric accelerated failure time model for paired doubly interval-censored data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st107oa,MAR 2006,29,13,"In this paper, we propose a methodology which a) evaluates the effect of covariates on doubly interval-censored paired responses, b) is based on minimal parametric assumptions concerning the distributional parts of the model and c) evaluates the association between the two responses of the pair. Our methodology tackles three research questions arising from the Signal Tandillobiel (R) project, a prospective Flemish (Belgian) longitudinal dental study. The research questions are 1) What is the effect of baseline covariates on the time-to-caries of the permanent right first molars? 2) Is the effect of the covariates the same for the upper and lower teeth? 3) What is the association between the times-to-caries on the upper and lower teeth? Time-to-caries is defined as the difference of two interval-censored observations, caries time and emergence time, and hence it is a doubly interval-censored response. We Suggest using an accelcrated failure time model with a bivariate smooth error distribution being a mixture of bivariate normal components defined on a fine fixed grid. To deal with the problem of doubly interval censoring, we use Bayesian methodology and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.","density smoothing,Gaussian Markov random field,Markov chain Monte Carlo,regression,survival data","SURVIVAL-DATA,LIFE-TABLES,DISTRIBUTIONS,ASSOCIATION,REGRESSION","Komarek, A@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Lesaffre, E@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Komarek, A@KU Leuven::Lesaffre, E@KU Leuven","Komarek, Arnost@A-5534-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8778-3762","BAYESIAN COMPUTATION AND STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS+BESAG, J; GREEN, P; HIGDON, D; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 1995::no title+BOGAERTS K+ESTIMATING KENDALLS+2006::MODEL FOR ASSOCIATION IN BIVARIATE LIFE TABLES AND ITS APPLICATION IN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL-STUDIES OF FAMILIAL TENDENCY IN CHRONIC DISEASE INCIDENCE+CLAYTON, DG+BIOMETRIKA+1978::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::ANALYSIS OF DOUBLY-CENSORED SURVIVAL-DATA, WITH APPLICATION TO AIDS+DEGRUTTOLA, V; LAGAKOS, SW+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1989::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

Estimation in generalised linear mixed models with binary outcomes by simulated maximum likelihood,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st106oa,MAR 2006,30,28,"Fitting multilevel models to discrete outcome data is problematic because the discrete distribution of the response variable implies an analytically intractable log-likelihood function. Among a number of approximate methods proposed, second-order penalised quasi-likelihood (PQL) is commonly used and is one of the most accurate. Unfortunately even the second-ordcr PQL approximation has been shown to produce estimates biased toward zero in certain circumstances. This bias can be marked especially when the data are sparse. One option to reduce this bias is to use Monte-Carlo simulation. A bootstrap bias correction method proposed by Kuk has been implemented in MLwiN. However, a similar technique based on the Robbins-Monro (RM) algorithm is potentially more efficient. An alternative is to use simulated maximum likelihood (SML), either alone or to refine estimates identified by other methods. In this article, we first compare bias correction using the RM algorithm, Kuk's method and SML. We find that SML performs as efficiently as the other two methods and also yields standard errors of the bias-corrected parameter estimates and an estimate of the log-likelihood at the maximum, with which nested models can be compared. Secondly, using Simulated and real data examples, we compare SML, second-order Laplace approximation (as implemented in HLM), Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) (in MLwiN) and numerical integration using adaptive quadrature methods (in Stata's GLLAMM and in SAS's proc NLMIXED). We find that when the data are sparse, the second-order Laplace approximation produces markedly lower parameter estimates, whereas the MCMC method produces estimates that ire noticeably higher than those from the SML and quadrature methods. Although proc NLMIXED is much faster than GLLAMM, it is not designed to fit models of more than two levels. SML produces parameter estimates and log-likelihoods very similar to those from quadrature methods. Further our SML approach extends to handle other link functions, discrete data distributions, non-normal random effects and higher-level models.","bias correction,Kuk's method,Monte-Carlo integration,numerical integration,Robbins-Monro algorithm,simulated maximum likelihood","MULTILEVEL MODELS,LEAST-SQUARES,RESPONSES","Ng, ESW@Univ Bristol, Grad Sch Educ, Ctr Multilevel Modelling, Bristol BS8 1JA, Avon, England@Univ London, London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Med Stat Unit, London WC1E 7HU, England::Carpenter, JR@Univ Bristol, Grad Sch Educ, Ctr Multilevel Modelling, Bristol BS8 1JA, Avon, England@Univ London, London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Med Stat Unit, London WC1E 7HU, England::Goldstein, H@Univ Bristol, Grad Sch Educ, Ctr Multilevel Modelling, Bristol BS8 1JA, Avon, England@Univ London, London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Med Stat Unit, London WC1E 7HU, England::Rasbash, J@Univ Bristol, Grad Sch Educ, Ctr Multilevel Modelling, Bristol BS8 1JA, Avon, England@Univ London, London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Med Stat Unit, London WC1E 7HU, England","Ng, ESW@University of Bristol@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine@University of London::Carpenter, JR@University of Bristol@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine@University of London::Goldstein, H@University of Bristol@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine@University of London::Rasbash, J@University of Bristol@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine@University of London","Ng, Edmond@G-8788-2011::Carpenter, James@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3890-6206::Goldstein, Harvey@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3878-4122","no title+AMIN S+CONTINUING DEMOGRAPH+1997::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::no title+BOOTH JG+SURVEY MONTE CARLO A+2001::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+BROWNE WJ+MCMC ESTIMATION NLWI+2002::Test inversion bootstrap confidence intervals+Carpenter, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::no title+CARPENTER JR+MODELLING REPEATED O+2003::no title+COLEMAN TF+MATH PROGRAM+1994::An interior trust region approach for nonlinear minimization subject to bounds+Coleman, TF; Li, YY+SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION+MAY 1996::no title+CONGDON R+COMMUNICATION+2005::RESTRICTED UNBIASED ITERATIVE GENERALIZED LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATION+GOLDSTEIN, H+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1989::MULTILEVEL MIXED LINEAR-MODEL ANALYSIS USING ITERATIVE GENERALIZED LEAST-SQUARES+GOLDSTEIN, H+BIOMETRIKA+APR 1986::Improved approximations for multilevel models with binary responses+Goldstein, H; Rasbash, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1996::no title+Goldstein, H.+Multilevel Statistical Models+2003::no title+HUQ N+BANGLADESH FERTILITY+1990::ASYMPTOTICALLY UNBIASED ESTIMATION IN GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS WITH RANDOM EFFECTS+KUK, AYC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Bias correction in generalized linear mixed models with multiple components of dispersion+Lin, XH; Breslow, NE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1996::no title+*MATHW INC+MATL+2003::Maximum likelihood algorithms for generalized linear mixed models+McCulloch, CE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::no title+PAN JX+COMPSTAT 1998+1988::Maximum likelihood estimation of limited and discrete dependent variable models with nested random effects+Rabe-Hesketh, S; Skrondal, A; Pickles, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 2005::no title+Rasbash, J.; Browne, W.; Goldstein, H.+A user's guide to MLwiN (version 2. 1)+2000::no title+RAUDENBUSH SW+HLM 6 HIERARCHICAL L+2004::Maximum likelihood for generalized linear models with nested random effects via high-order, multivariate Laplace approximation+Raudenbush, SW; Yang, ML; Yosef, M+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2000::no title+Ripley, B.+Stochastic simulation+1987::AN ASSESSMENT OF ESTIMATION PROCEDURES FOR MULTILEVEL MODELS WITH BINARY RESPONSES+RODRIGUEZ, G; GOLDMAN, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1995::ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATORS AND LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS UNDER NONSTANDARD CONDITIONS+SELF, SG; LIANG, KY+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1987::no title+Spiegelhalter, D.

Regression models for covariance structures in longitudinal studies,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st105oa,MAR 2006,19,23,"A convenient reparametrization of the marginal covariance matrix arising in longitudinal studies is discussed. The new parameters have transparent statistical interpretations, are Unconstrained and may be modelled parsimoniously in terms of polynomials of time. We exploit this framework to model the dependence of the covariance structure on baseline covariates, time and their interaction. The rationale is based on the assumption that a homogeneous covariance structure with respect to the covariate space is a testable model choice. Accordingly, we provide methods for testing this assumption by incorporating covariates along with time into the model for the covariance structure. We also present new Computational algorithms which can handle unbalanced longitudinal data, thereby extending existing methods. The new model is used to analyse Kenward's (1987) cattle data, and the findings are compared with published analyses of the same data set.","Cholesky decomposition,covariate dependent covariance matrix,joint mean-covariance models,longitudinal trials,unbalanced observations,unconstrained parametrization",,"Pan, JX@Univ Limerick, Ctr Biostat, Limerick, Ireland@Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England::MacKenzie, G@Univ Limerick, Ctr Biostat, Limerick, Ireland@Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Pan, JX@University of Limerick@University of Manchester::MacKenzie, G@University of Limerick@University of Manchester","Pan, Jianxin@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7460-6350","Bayesian analysis of covariance matrices and dynamic models for longitudinal data+Daniels, MJ; Pourahmadi, M+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::Nonparametric estimation of covariance structure in longitudinal data+Diggle, P.J.; Verbyla, A.P.+Biometrics+1998::MULTILEVEL TIME-SERIES MODELS WITH APPLICATIONS TO REPEATED-MEASURES DATA+GOLDSTEIN, H; HEALY, MJR; RASBASH, J+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 30 1994::no title+Jones, R.

Assessment of variance components in elliptical linear mixed models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X06st104oa,MAR 2006,24,17,"The aim of this article is to discuss the problem of testing variance components in elliptical linear mixed models. The elliptical class includes all symmetrical continuous distributions, such as normal, Student-t, Pearson VII, power exponential, logistic 1, logistic 11, and so on. An approach for elliptical linear mixed models is proposed. The estimation procedure for the fixed parameters, variance components and random effects is also presented and a score-type test for one-sided alternatives to assess the variance components is investigated. Finally, two illustrative examples are given in which normal linear mixed models arc compared with elliptical linear mixed models with heavy-tailed error distributions.","elliptical distributions,hypothesis testing,one-sided alternatives,robust models,score tests,variance components","MULTIVARIATE-T-DISTRIBUTION,LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS,NONSTANDARD CONDITIONS,INFERENCE,DISTRIBUTIONS,JOINT","Savalli, C@USP, Inst Matemat & Estat, BR-05311970 Sao Paulo, Brazil@Univ Fed Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil::Paula, GA@USP, Inst Matemat & Estat, BR-05311970 Sao Paulo, Brazil@Univ Fed Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil::Cysneiros, FJA@USP, Inst Matemat & Estat, BR-05311970 Sao Paulo, Brazil@Univ Fed Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil","Savalli, C@Universidade de Sao Paulo@Universidade Federal de Pernambuco::Paula, GA@Universidade de Sao Paulo@Universidade Federal de Pernambuco::Cysneiros, FJA@Universidade de Sao Paulo@Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","Paula, Gilberto@D-2924-2012::Cysneiros, Francisco@G-6333-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6757-6969","One-sided tests in linear models with multivariate t-distribution+Cysneiros, FJA; Paula, GA+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2004::no title+Doornik, J.

Modelling of repeated ordered measurements by isotonic sequential regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st101oa,DEC 2005,33,18,"This article introduces a simple model for repeated observations of ail ordered categorical response variable which is isotonic over time. It is assumed that the measurements represent an irreversible process such that the response at time t is never lower than the response observed at the previous time point t - 1. Observations of this type occur, for example, in treatment studies when improvement is measured on an ordinal scale. As the response at time t depends oil the previous outcome, the number of ordered response categories depends oil the previous outcome leading to severe problems when simple threshold models for ordered data are Used. To avoid these problems, the isotonic sequential model is introduced. It accounts for the irreversible process by considering the binary transitions to higher scores and allows a parsimonious parameterization. It is shown how the model may easily be estimated using existing software. Moreover, the model is extended to a random effects version which explicitly takes heterogeneity of individuals and potential correlations into account.","cumulative model,isotonic ordinal regression,ordinal data,random effects models,repeated measurements,sequential model","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,ORDINAL LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS,MISSING OBSERVATIONS,CATEGORICAL-DATA,COMPONENT,OUTCOMES","Tutz, G@Univ Munich, Inst Stat, Munich, Germany","Tutz, G@University of Munich",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Modelling ordered categorical data: Recent advances and future challenges+Agresti, A+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 30 1999::VARIANCE COMPONENT MODELS WITH BINARY RESPONSE - INTERVIEWER VARIABILITY+ANDERSON, DA; AITKIN, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1985::ORDINAL REGRESSION-MODELS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC DATA+ARMSTRONG, BG; SLOAN, M+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+JAN 1989::OVERVIEW OF MULTINOMIAL MODELS FOR ORDINAL DATA+BARNHART, KX; SAMPSON, AR+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1994::LOGISTIC-REGRESSION FOR DEPENDENT BINARY OBSERVATIONS+BONNEY, GE+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1987::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::ASSESSING PROPORTIONALITY IN THE PROPORTIONAL ODDS MODEL FOR ORDINAL LOGISTIC-REGRESSION+BRANT, R+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1990::BIAS CORRECTION IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS WITH A SINGLE-COMPONENT OF DISPERSION+BRESLOW, NE; LIN, XH+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1995::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+COX C+STAT MED+1988::no title+CRAMER J+LOGIT MODEL+1991::SEMIPARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF REPEATED MEASUREMENTS WITH APPLICATIONS TO CLINICAL-TRIALS+DAVIS, CS+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 1991::An application of isotonic longitudinal marginal regression to monitoring the healing process+Fahrmeir, L; Gieger, C; Heumann, C+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1999::no title+Fahrmeir, L.; Tutz, G.+Multivariate statistical modelling based on generalized linear models+2001::ALTERNATIVE MODELS FOR ORDINAL LOGISTIC-REGRESSION+GREENLAND, S+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 30 1994::no title+Hastie, T.

Mining epidemiological time series: an approach based on dynamic regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st103oa,DEC 2005,23,7,"In epidemiology, time-series regression models are specially Suitable for evaluating short-term effects of time-varying exposures to pollution. To summarize findings from different Studies oil different cities, the techniques of designed meta-analyses have been employed. In this context, city-specific findings are summarized by an 'effect size' measured on a common scale. Such effects are then pooled together oil a second hierarchy of analysis. The objective of this article is to exploit exploratory analysis of city-specific time series. In fact, when dealing with many Sources of data, that is, many cities, an exploratory analysis becomes almost unaffordable. Our idea is to explore the time series by fitting complete dynamic regression models.

The idea is to highlight he common features across cities through this analysis, which might then be used to design the meta-analysis.

Analyzing lifetime data with long-tailed skewed distribution: the logistic-sinh family,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st099oa,DEC 2005,25,1,"A new two-parameter family of distribution is presented. It is derived to model the highly negatively skewed data with extreme observations. The new family of distribution is referred to as the logistic-sinh distribution, as it is derived from the logistic distribution by appropriately replacing in exponential term with I hyperbolic sine term. The resulting family provides not only negatively skewed densities with thick tails but also variety of monotonic density shapes. The space of shape parameter, lambda greater than zero is divided by boundary line of lambda equals one, into two regions over which the hazard function is, respectively, increasing and bathtub shaped. The maximum likelihood parameter estimation techniques are discussed by providing approximate coverage probabilities for uncensored samples. The advantages of using the new family are demonstrated and compared by illustrating well known examples.","bathtub shaped failure rate,coverage probabilities,goodness-of-fit,increasing failure rate,Kaplan-Meier curve,right censoring",,"Cooray, K@Univ Nevada, Dept Math Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA","Cooray, K@Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE)@University of Nevada Las Vegas",not exist,"no title+ALAKRISHNAN N+HDB LOGISTIC DISTRIB+1992::no title+BAIN LJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::no title+Barlow, R.

A statistical framework for the analysis of multivariate infectious disease surveillance counts,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st098oa,OCT 2005,22,63,"A framework for the statistical analysis of counts from infectious disease surveillance databases is proposed. In its simplest form, the model can be seen as a Poisson branching process model with immigration. Extensions to include seasonal effects, time trends and overdispersion are outlined. The model is shown to provide an adequate fit and reliable one-step-ahead prediction intervals for a typical infectious disease time series. In addition, a multivariate formulation is proposed, which is well suited to capture space-time dependence caused by the spatial spread of a disease over time. An analysis of two multivariate time series is described. All analyses have been done using general optimization routines, where ML estimates and corresponding standard errors are readily available.","branching process with immigration,infectious disease surveillance,maximum likelihood,multivariate time series of counts,observation-driven,parameter-driven,space-time models","TIME-SERIES,SPACE,MODEL,OUTBREAKS","Held, L@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Hohle, M@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Hofmann, M@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Held, L@University of Munich::Hohle, M@University of Munich::Hofmann, M@University of Munich","Held, Leonhard@E-8159-2010::Hohle, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0423-6702","no title+Becker, NG.+Analysis of infectious disease data+1989::Empirical Bayes estimators and non-parametric mixture models for space and time-space disease mapping and surveillance+Bohning, D+ENVIRONMETRICS+AUG 2003::SPATIAL CORRELATION IN ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS+CLAYTON, DG; BERNARDINELLI, L; MONTOMOLI, C+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 1993::STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF TIME-SERIES - SOME RECENT DEVELOPMENTS+COX, DR+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1981::no title+Denison, D; Holmes, C; Malick, B<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Smith, A</span>.+Bayesian methods for nonlinear classification and regression+2002::no title+Diggle, P.; Heagerty, P.; Liang, K.

Joint modelling of recurrence and progression of adenomas: a latent variable approach,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st094oa,OCT 2005,13,5,"In this paper, we treat the number of recurrent adenomatous polyps as a latent variable and then use a mixture distribution to model the number of observed recurrent adenomatous polyps. This approach is equivalent to zero-inflated Poisson regression, which is a method used to analyse count data with excess zeros. In a zero-inflated Poisson model, a count response variable is assumed to be distributed as a mixture of a Poisson distribution and a distribution with point mass of one at zero. In many cancer studies, patients often have variable follow-up. When the disease of interest is subject to late onset, ignoring the length of follow-up will underestimate the recurrence rate. In this paper, we modify zero-inflated Poisson regression through a weight function to incorporate the length of follow-up into analysis. We motivate, develop, and illustrate the methods described here with an example from a colon cancer study.","latent variable,measurement error,mixture distribution,robust weight function,variable follow-up,zero-inflated poisson","POISSON REGRESSION,TRIALS,DESIGN,ONSET","Hsu, CH@Univ Arizona, Coll Publ Hlth, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA@Arizona Canc Ctr, Tucson, AZ USA","Hsu, CH@University of Arizona@Arizona Center Cancer Care",not exist,"Lack of effect of a high-fiber cereal supplement on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas+Alberts, DS; Martinez, ME; Roe, DJ; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+APR 20 2000::Zero-inflated Poisson models and C.A.MAN: A tutorial collection of evidence+Bohning, D+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1998::The zero-inflated Poisson model and the decayed, missing and filled teeth index in dental epidemiology+Bohning, D; Dietz, E; Schlattmann, P; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1999::Sequential designs for phase I clinical trials with late-onset toxicities+Cheung, YK; Chappell, R+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2000::On estimation of the Poisson parameter in zero-modified Poisson models+Dietz, E; Bohning, D+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 28 2000::Modeling tumor onset and multiplicity using transition models with latent variables+Dunson, DB; Haseman, JK+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1999::Surrogate end-point biomarkers as measures of colon cancer risk and their use in cancer chemoprevention trials+Einspahr, JG; Alberts, DS; Gapstur, SM; et al.+CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS &amp; PREVENTION+JAN 1997::DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF STUDIES TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF COLON POLYPS+EMERSON, SS; MCGEE, DL; FENNERTY, B; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 1993::Cancer statistics, 2004+Jemal, A; Tiwari, RC; Murray, T; et al.+CA-A CANCER JOURNAL FOR CLINICIANS+JAN-FEB 2004::ZERO-INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION, WITH AN APPLICATION TO DEFECTS IN MANUFACTURING+LAMBERT, D+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::Design and baseline characteristics of study participants in the Wheat Bran Fiber trial+Martinez, ME; Reid, ME; Guillen-Rodriguez, J; et al.+CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS &amp; PREVENTION+SEP 1998::A SCORE TEST FOR ZERO INFLATION IN A POISSON-DISTRIBUTION+VANDENBROEK, J+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1995::Mixed Poisson regression models with covariate dependent rates+Wang, PM; Puterman, ML; Cockburn, I; et al.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1996"

The benefits of our approach are the simplicity of implementation and the potential to handle large data sets. The estimators based on the pairwise likelihood are generally consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. The pairwise likelihood makes it possible to improve on standard inferential procedures by means of bootstrap methods.

Two slice-EM algorithms for fitting generalized linear mixed models with binary response,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st097oa,OCT 2005,37,7,"The celebrated simplicity of the EM algorithm is somewhat lost in its common use for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) because of its analytically intractable E-step. A natural and typical strategy in practice is to implement the E-step via Monte Carlo by drawing the unobserved random effects from their conditional distribution as specified by the E-step. In this paper, we show that further augmenting the missing data (e.g., the random effects) used by the M-step leads to a quite attractive and general slice sampler for implementing the Monte Carlo E-step. The slice sampler scheme is straightforward to implement, and it is neither restricted to the particular choice of the link function (e.g., probit) nor to the distribution of the random effects (e.g., normal). We apply this scheme to the standard EM algorithm as well as to an alternative EM algorithm which treats the variance-standardized random effects, rather than the random effects themselves, as missing data. The alternative EM algorithm does not only have faster convergence, but also leads to generalized linear model-like variance estimation, because it converts the random-effect standard deviations into linear regression parameters. Using the well-known salamander mating problem, we compare these two algorithms with each other, as well as with a variety of methods given in the literature in terms of the resulting point and interval estimates.","auxiliary variables,data augmentation,EM algorithm,Markov chain Monte Carlo,mixed effect,random effect,slice sampler","CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES,LAPLACE APPROXIMATION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,IMPLEMENTATIONS","Vaida, F@Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Div Biostat & Bioinformat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA@Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA::Meng, XL@Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Div Biostat & Bioinformat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA@Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Vaida, F@University of California San Diego@University of California System@Harvard University::Meng, XL@University of California San Diego@University of California System@Harvard University",not exist,"RANDOM EFFECTS IN GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS AND THE EM ALGORITHM+ANDERSON, DA; HINDE, JP+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1988::ALMOST SURE CONVERGENCE OF A CLASS OF STOCHASTIC ALGORITHMS+BISCARAT, JC+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+MAR 1994::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::no title+BRESLOW NE+J AM STAT ASSOC+1993::Maximum likelihood estimation for probit-linear mixed models with correlated random effects+Chan, JSK; Kuk, AYC+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1997::MONTE-CARLO EM ESTIMATION FOR TIME-SERIES MODELS INVOLVING COUNTS+CHAN, KS; LEDOLTER, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1995::Generalized linear mixed models+Clayton, D.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice+1996::Gibbs sampling for Bayesian non-conjugate and hierarchical models by using auxiliary variables+Damien, P; Wakefield, J; Walker, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::no title+Diggle, PJ; Liang, K-Y; Zeger, S.+Analysis of Longitudinal Data+1994::Adaptive rejection sampling for Gibbs sampling+Gilks, W.

Mixture of linear mixed models for clustering gene expression profiles from repeated microarray experiments,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st096oa,OCT 2005,29,46,"Data variability can be important in microarray data analysis. Thus, when clustering gene expression profiles, it could be judicious to make use of repeated data. In this paper, the problem of analysing repeated data in the model-based cluster analysis context is considered. Linear mixed models are chosen to take into account data variability and mixture of these models are considered. This leads to a large range of possible models depending on the assumptions made on both the covariance structure of the observations and the mixture model. The maximum likelihood estimation of this family of models through the EM algorithm is presented. The problem of selecting a particular mixture of linear mixed models is considered using penalized likelihood criteria. Illustrative Monte Carlo experiments are presented and an application to the clustering of gene expression profiles is detailed. All those experiments highlight the interest of linear mixed model mixtures to take into account data variability in a cluster analysis context.","cluster analysis,gene expression profile,linear model,mixture model,penalized likelihood criteria,random effect","EM ALGORITHM,LIKELIHOOD,PATTERNS","Celeux, G@INRA, Unite Proteom, F-34060 Montpellier, France@Univ Paris Sud, Dept Math, Paris, France@Inst Math & Modelisat Montpellier, Montpellier, France::Martin, O@INRA, Unite Proteom, F-34060 Montpellier, France@Univ Paris Sud, Dept Math, Paris, France@Inst Math & Modelisat Montpellier, Montpellier, France::Lavergne, C@INRA, Unite Proteom, F-34060 Montpellier, France@Univ Paris Sud, Dept Math, Paris, France@Inst Math & Modelisat Montpellier, Montpellier, France","Celeux, G@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Universite Paris Saclay@Universite Paris Sud - Paris 11@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)@Unknow::Martin, O@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Universite Paris Saclay@Universite Paris Sud - Paris 11@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)@Unknow::Lavergne, C@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Universite Paris Saclay@Universite Paris Sud - Paris 11@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)@Unknow",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Optimization of mixture models: Comparison of different strategies+Berchtold, A+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2004::Choosing starting values for the EM algorithm for getting the highest likelihood in multivariate Gaussian mixture models+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2000::Gaussian model selection+Birge, L; Massart, P.+J Eur Math Soc+2001::no title+CELEUX G+MIXTURE LINEAR MIXED+2002::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Expression profiling using cDNA microarrays+Duggan, DJ; Bittner, M; Chen, YD; et al.+NATURE GENETICS+JAN 1999::Microarrays and Their Use in a Comparative Experiment+Efron, B.+technical report+2000::Cluster analysis and display of genome-wide expression patterns+Eisen, MB; Spellman, PT; Brown, PO; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+DEC 8 1998::How many clusters?

The practical utility of incorporating model selection uncertainty into prognostic models for survival data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st089oa,JUL 2005,49,21,"Predictions of disease outcome in prognostic factor models are usually based on one selected model. However, often several models fit the data equally well, but these models might differ substantially in terms of included explanatory variables and might lead to different predictions for individual patients. For survival data, we discuss two approaches to account for model selection uncertainty in two data examples, with the main emphasis on variable selection in a proportional hazard Cox model. The main aim of our investigation is to establish the ways in which either of the two approaches is useful in such prognostic models. The first approach is Bayesian model averaging (BMA) adapted for the proportional hazard model, termed 'approx. BMA' here. As a new approach, we propose a method which averages over a set of possible models using weights estimated from bootstrap resampling as proposed by Buckland et al., but in addition, we perform an initial screening of variables based on the inclusion frequency of each variable to reduce the set of variables and corresponding models. For some necessary parameters of the procedure, investigations concerning sensible choices are still required. The main objective of prognostic models is prediction, but the interpretation of single effects is also important and models should be general enough to ensure transportability to other clinical centres. In the data examples, we compare predictions of our new approach with approx. BMA, with 'conventional' predictions from one selected model and with predictions from the full model. Confidence intervals are compared in one example. Comparisons are based on the partial predictive score and the Brier score. We conclude that the two model averaging methods yield similar results and are especially useful when there is a high number of potential prognostic factors, most likely some of them without influence in a multivariable context. Although the method based on bootstrap resampling lacks formal justification and requires some ad hoc decisions, it has the additional positive effect of achieving model parsimony by reducing the number of explanatory variables and dealing with correlated variables in in automatic fashion.","bootstrap,model averaging,model selection uncertainty,prognostic factor models,survival analysis","COX REGRESSION-MODEL,LINEAR-REGRESSION,CROSS-VALIDATION,BOOTSTRAP,INFERENCE,INFORMATION","Augustin, N@Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Inst Med Biometrie & Med Informat, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany@Univ Glasgow, Dept Stat, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland::Sauerbrei, W@Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Inst Med Biometrie & Med Informat, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany@Univ Glasgow, Dept Stat, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland::Schumacher, M@Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Inst Med Biometrie & Med Informat, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany@Univ Glasgow, Dept Stat, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Augustin, N@University of Freiburg@University of Glasgow::Sauerbrei, W@University of Freiburg@University of Glasgow::Schumacher, M@University of Freiburg@University of Glasgow","Augustin, Nicole@E-5501-2010::Augustin, Nicole@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6644-3742","What do we mean by validating a prognostic model?+Altman, DG; Royston, P+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 29 2000::BOOTSTRAP INVESTIGATION OF THE STABILITY OF A COX REGRESSION-MODEL+ALTMAN, DG; ANDERSEN, PK+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 1989::INFLUENCE OF MODEL-BUILDING STRATEGIES ON THE RESULTS OF A CASE-CONTROL STUDY+BLETTNER, M; SAUERBREI, W+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 30 1993::Heuristics of instability and stabilization in model selection+Breiman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1996::THE LITTLE BOOTSTRAP AND OTHER METHODS FOR DIMENSIONALITY SELECTION IN REGRESSION - X-FIXED PREDICTION ERROR+BREIMAN, L+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1992::Bagging predictors+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+AUG 1996::Verification of forecasts expressed in terms of probability+Brier, G.

Graphical chain models for the analysis of complex genetic diseases: an application to hypertension,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st088oa,JUL 2005,24,1,"A crucial task in modern genetic medicine is the understanding of complex genetic diseases. The main complicating features are that a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors is involved, and the phenotype of interest may be complex. Traditional statistical techniques based on lod-scores fail when the disease is no longer monogenic and the underlying disease transmission model is not defined. Different kinds of association tests have been proved to be an appropriate and powerful statistical tool to detect a 'candidate gene' for a complex disorder. However, statistical techniques able to investigate direct and indirect influences among phenotypes, genotypes and environmental risk factors, are required to analyse the association structure of complex diseases. In this paper, we propose graphical models as a natural tool to analyse the multifactorial structure of complex genetic diseases. An application of this model to primary hypertension data set is illustrated.","complex disorders,conditional independence,genotype,graphical chain models,phenotype","CONDITIONAL-INDEPENDENCE,POLYMORPHISM","Di Serio, C@Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, I-20132 Milan, Italy@Univ Rome, Rome, Italy::Vicard, P@Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, I-20132 Milan, Italy@Univ Rome, Rome, Italy","Di Serio, C@Vita-Salute San Raffaele University@Sapienza University Rome::Vicard, P@Vita-Salute San Raffaele University@Sapienza University Rome",not exist,"Polymorphism in the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor gene and hypertension+Bengtsson, K; Melander, O; Orho-Melander, M; et al.+CIRCULATION+JUL 10 2001::Statistical properties of the allelic and genotypic transmission/disequilibrium test for multiallelic markers+Bickeboller, H; ClergetDarpoux, F+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+1995::Interactive analysis of high-dimensional association structures with graphical models+Blauth, A; Pigeot, I; Bry, F+METRIKA+2000::A graphical chain model derived from a model selection strategy for the sociologists graduates study+Caputo, A; Heinicke, A; Pigeot, I+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1999::ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME I/D POLYMORPHISM AND ARTERIAL-WALL THICKNESS IN A GENERAL-POPULATION - THE VOBARNO STUDY+CASTELLANO, M; MUIESAN, ML; RIZZONI, D; et al.+CIRCULATION+JUN 1 1995::no title+CLARGETDARPOUX F+KIDNEY INT+1998::TESTS OF LINEARITY, MULTIVARIATE NORMALITY AND THE ADEQUACY OF LINEAR SCORES+COX, DR; WERMUTH, N+APPLIED STATISTICS-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C+1994::no title+Cox, DR; Wermuth, N.+Multivariate dependencies+1996::A primer on the genetics of hypertension+Cusi, D; Bianchi, G+KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL+AUG 1998::CONDITIONAL INDEPENDENCE IN STATISTICAL-THEORY+DAWID, AP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1979::The TM algorithm for maximising a conditional likelihood function+Edwards, D; Lauritzen, SL+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::no title+Edwards, D.+Introduction to Graphical Modeling+2000::THE CHAIN GRAPH MARKOV PROPERTY+FRYDENBERG, M+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1990::Is there a pathogenetic role for uric acid in hypertension and cardiovascular and renal disease?+Johnson, RJ; Kang, DH; Feig, D; et al.+HYPERTENSION+JUN 2003::no title+Kaufman, L.; Rousseeuw, P.+Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis+1990::no title+Lauritzen, S.L.+Graphical Models+1996::Chain graph models and their causal interpretations+Lauritzen, S.

These models are built using data from earlier customers, but have several weaknesses. An alternative approach, widely used in social measurement, bur apparently not yet applied in the retail banking sector, is to use latent-variable techniques to measure the underlying key aspect of customer behaviour. This paper describes such a model that separates the observed variables for a customer into primary characteristics on the one hand, and indicators of previous behaviour on the other, and links the two via a latent variable that we identify as 'customer quality'. We describe how to estimate the conditional distribution of customer quality, given the observed values of primary characteristics and past behaviour.","credit cards,financial delinquency,latent variables,loan default,prediction,random effects,retail banking,scorecards","CREDIT,CLASSIFICATION,DISCRETE,MODELS","Hand, DJ@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England::Crowder, MJ@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England","Hand, DJ@Imperial College London::Crowder, MJ@Imperial College London",not exist,"no title+no author+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS+1965::no title+Bartholomew, DJ; Knott, M.+Latent Variable Models and Factor Analysis+1999::no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::no title+CROOK J+CREDIT SCORING CREDI+2001::THE EVALUATION OF INTEGRALS OF THE FORM INTEGRAL-INFINITY+INFINITY F(T)EXP(-T2) DT - APPLICATION TO LOGISTIC NORMAL-MODELS+CROUCH, EAC; SPIEGELMAN, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::no title+GANA R+5 C CRED SCOR CRED C+1997::THE EVALUATION OF INTEGRALS OF THE FORM INTEGRAL-INFINITY-INFINITY-F(X)E-X2-DX+GOODWIN, ET+PROCEEDINGS OF THE CAMBRIDGE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY+1949::Modelling consumer credit risk+Hand, D.J.+IMA Journal of Management Mathematics+Oct. 2001::Graphical models of applicants for credit+Hand, D.J.; McConway, K.J.; Stanghellini, E.+IMA Journal of Mathematics Applied in Business and Industry+March 1997::Reject inference in credit operations+Hand, D.

A latent variable scorecard for neonatal baby frailty,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st093oa,JUL 2005,15,0,"A latent variable frailty model is built for data coming from a neonatal study conducted to investigate whether the presence of a particular hospital service given to families with premature babies has a positive effect on their care requirements within the first year of life. The predicted value of the latent frailty term from information obtained from the family in advance of the birth furnishes an overall measure of the quality of health of the baby. This identifies families at risk. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches are used to estimate the effect of the variables on the value of the latent baby frailty and for prediction of health complications. It is found that these give much the same estimates of regression coefficients, but that the variance components are the more difficult to estimate. We indicate how the findings from the model may be presented as a scorecard for predicting frailty, and so be useful to doctors working in hospital neonatal units.

The role of perturbation in compositional data analysis,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st091oa,JUL 2005,10,13,"In standard multivariate statistical analysis, common hypotheses of interest concern changes in mean vectors and subvectors. In compositional data analysis it is now well established that compositional change is most readily described in terms of the simplicial operation of perturbation and that subcompositions replace the marginal concept of subvectors. Against the background of two motivating experimental studies in the food industry, involving the compositions of cow's milk and chicken carcasses, this paper emphasizes the importance of recognizing this fundamental operation of change in the associated simplex sample space. Well-defined hypotheses about the nature of any compositional effect can be expressed, for example, in terms of perturbation values and subcompositional stability and testing procedures developed. These procedures are applied to lattices of such hypotheses in the two practical situations. We identify the two problems as being the counterpart of the analysis of paired comparison or split plot experiments and of separate sample comparative experiments in the jargon of standard multivariate analysis.","compositional paired comparisons,group operations in the simplex,logistic-normal distributions,subcompositional stability",,"Aitchison, J@Univ Glasgow, Dept Stat, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Ng, KW@Univ Glasgow, Dept Stat, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Aitchison, J@University of Glasgow@University of Hong Kong::Ng, KW@University of Glasgow@University of Hong Kong",not exist,"Simplicial inference+Aitchison, J.+Algebraic methods in statistics and probability+2001::LOGISTIC-NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS - SOME PROPERTIES AND USES+AITCHISON, J; SHEN, SM+BIOMETRIKA+1980::THE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITIONAL DATA+AITCHISON, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::no title+AITCHISON J+P IAMG 98 4 ANN C IN+1998::no title+AITCHISON J+TERRA NOSTRA+2002::no title+AITCHISON J+TERRA NOSTRA+2002::no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::The One-hour Course in Compositional Data Analysis or Compositional Data Analysis Is Simple+Aitchison, J.+P IAMG 97 3 ANN C IN+1997::no title+Anderson, T.

Random effect models for repeated measures of zero-inflated count data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471.082X05st084oa,MAR 2005,25,152,"For count responses, the situation of excess zeros (relative to what standard models allow) often occurs in biomedical and sociological applications. Modeling repeated measures of zero-inflated count data presents special challenges. This is because in addition to the problem of extra zeros, the correlation between measurements upon the same subject at different occasions needs to be taken into account. This article discusses random effect models for repeated measurements on this type of response variable. A useful model is the hurdle model with random effects, which separately handles the zero observations and the positive counts. In maximum likelihood model fitting, we consider both a normal distribution and a nonparametric approach for the random effects. A special case of the hurdle model can be used to test for zero inflation. Random effects can also be introduced in a zero-inflated Poisson or negative binomial model, but such a model may encounter fitting problems if there is zero deflation at any settings of the explanatory variables. A simple alternative approach adapts the cumulative logit model with random effects, which has a single set of parameters for describing effects. We illustrate the proposed methods with examples.","cumulative logit model,generalized linear mixed model,hurdle model,negative binomial model,nonparametric mixture model,zero-inflated Poisson model","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,POISSON REGRESSION,TESTS","Min, YY@UN, Div Stat, New York, NY 10017 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Agresti, A@UN, Div Stat, New York, NY 10017 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Min, YY@Unknow@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Agresti, A@Unknow@State University System of Florida@University of Florida",not exist,"A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::ESTIMATION AND HYPOTHESIS-TESTING IN FINITE MIXTURE-MODELS+AITKIN, M; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1985::Who gets over the training hurdle?

Two-component mixtures of generalized linear mixed effects models for cluster correlated data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st090oa,MAR 2005,39,9,"Finite mixtures of generalized linear mixed effect models are presented to handle situations where within-cluster correlation and heterogeneity (subpopulations) exist simultaneously. For this class of model, we consider maximum likelihood (ML) as our main approach to estimation. Owing to the complexity of the marginal loglikelihood of this model, the EM algorithm is employed to facilitate computation. The major obstacle in this procedure is to integrate over the random effects' distribution to evaluate the expectation in the E step. When assuming normally distributed random effects, we consider adaptive Gaussian quadrature to perform this integration numerically. We also discuss nonparametric ML estimation under a relaxation of the normality assumption on the random effects.

Efficient models for correlated data via convolutions of intrinsic processes,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st085oa,MAR 2005,39,19,"Gaussian processes (GP) have proven to be useful and versatile stochastic models in a wide variety of applications including Computer experiments, environmental monitoring, hydrology and climate modeling. A GP model is determined by its mean and covariance functions. In most cases, the mean is specified to be a constant, or some other simple linear function, whereas the covariance function is governed by a few parameters. A Bayesian formulation is attractive as it allows for formal incorporation of uncertainty regarding the parameters governing the GP. However, estimation of these parameters can be problematic. Large datasets, posterior correlation and inverse problems can all lead to difficulties in exploring the posterior distribution. Here, we propose an alternative model which is quite tractable computationally - even with large datasets or indirectly observed data - while still maintaining the flexibility and adaptiveness of traditional GP models. This model is based on convolving simple Markov random fields with a smoothing kernel. We consider applications in hydrology and aircraft prototype testing.","conditional autoregression,inverse problem,moving average,nonstationarity,spatial correlation","FIELD,SIMULATIONS,CALIBRATION","Lee, HKH@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM USA@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@JP Morgan Chase, Columbus, OH USA::Higdon, DM@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM USA@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@JP Morgan Chase, Columbus, OH USA::Calder, CA@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM USA@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@JP Morgan Chase, Columbus, OH USA::Holloman, CH@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA@Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM USA@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@JP Morgan Chase, Columbus, OH USA","Lee, HKH@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Los Alamos National Laboratory@Ohio State University@JP Morgan Chase & Company::Higdon, DM@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Los Alamos National Laboratory@Ohio State University@JP Morgan Chase & Company::Calder, CA@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Los Alamos National Laboratory@Ohio State University@JP Morgan Chase & Company::Holloman, CH@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System@United States Department of Energy (DOE)@Los Alamos National Laboratory@Ohio State University@JP Morgan Chase & Company","Calder, Catherine@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4459-1418","no title+Banerjee, S; Carlin, BP; Gelfand, AE.+Hierarchical modeling and analysis for spatial data+2003::Blackbox kriging: spatial prediction without specifying variogram models.+Barry, R.

Software reliability modelling and prediction with hidden Markov chains,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X05st087oa,MAR 2005,27,9,"The purpose of this paper is to use the framework of hidden Markov chains (HMCs) for the modelling of the failure and debugging process of software, and the prediction of software reliability. The model parameters are estimated using the forward-backward expectation maximization algorithm, and model selection is done with the Bayesian information criterion. The advantages and drawbacks of this approach, with respect to usual modelling, are analysed. Comparison is also done on real software failure data. The main contribution of HMC modelling is that it highlights the existence of homogeneous periods in the debugging process, which allow one to identify major corrections or version updates. In terms of reliability predictions, the HMC model performs well, on average, with respect to usual models, especially when the reliability is not regularly growing.","BIC,debugging,EM,hidden Markov chains,reliability growth models,software reliability",ERROR-DETECTION,"Durand, JB@INP Grenoble, Lab IMAG, LMC, F-38041 Grenoble, France::Gaudoin, O@INP Grenoble, Lab IMAG, LMC, F-38041 Grenoble, France","Durand, JB@Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA)@Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble::Gaudoin, O@Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA)@Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble",not exist,"EVALUATION OF COMPETING SOFTWARE-RELIABILITY PREDICTIONS+ABDELGHALY, AA; CHAN, PY; LITTLEWOOD, B+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING+SEP 1986::Likelihood and Bayesian analysis of mixtures+Aitkin, Murray+STATISTICAL MODELLING+DEC 2001::no title+BASSEVILLE M+DETECTION ABRPUT CHA+1993::no title+CUTLER A+P 1 US JAP C FRONT S+1993::BAUM FORWARD - BACKWARD ALGORITHM REVISITED+DEVIJVER, PA+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+DEC 1985::LEARNING CURVE APPROACH TO RELIABILITY MONITORING+DUANE, JT+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE+1964::no title+DURAND JB+RR4747 INRIA+2003::Hidden Markov processes+Ephraim, Y; Merhav, N+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+JUN 2002::no title+GASSIAT E+ANN I HENRI PIONCARE+2002::no title+GAUDION O+THESIS J FOURIER U G+1990::A generalized geometric de-eutrophication software-reliability model+Gaudoin, O; Lavergne, C; Soler, JL.+IEEE Transactions on Reliability+1994::Software reliability models with two debugging rates+Gaudoinv, O.+Int.

A strategy of robust parameter design for multiple responses,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/147182X04st078oa,DEC 2004,22,4,"In this article, we provide a strategy for the simultaneous optimization of multiple responses. Cases are covered where a set of response variables has finite target values and depends on easy to control as well as on hard to control variables. Our approach is based on loss functions, without the need for a predefined cost matrix. For each element of a sequence of possible weights assigned to the individual responses, settings of the easy to control parameters are determined, which minimize the estimated mean of a multivariate loss function. The estimation is based on statistical models, which depend only on the easy to control variables. The loss function itself takes the value zero, if all responses are on target with zero variances. In each case, the derived parameter settings are connected to a specific compromise of the responses, which is graphically displayed to the engineer by so called joint optimization plots. The expert can thereby gain valuable insight into the production process and then decide on the most sensible parameter setting. The proposed strategy is illustrated with a data set from the literature and new data from an up to date application.","multiple responses,robust parameter design,simultaneous optimization,Taguchi methods","OPTIMIZATION,VARIABLES","Kuhnt, S@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Erdbrugge, M@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","Kuhnt, S@Dortmund University of Technology::Erdbrugge, M@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"Evaluation of statistical designs for experiments involving noise variables+Borror, CM; Montgomery, DC; Myers, RH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2002::no title+CHEN LH+COMPUTERS OPERATIONS+1997::Analyzing experiments with correlated multiple responses+Chiao, CH; Hamada, M+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2001::SIMULTANEOUS-OPTIMIZATION OF SEVERAL RESPONSE VARIABLES+DERRINGER, G; SUICH, R+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1980::Taguchi parameter design by second-order response surfaces+Engel, J; Huele, AF+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+MAR-APR 1996::A generalized linear modeling approach to robust design+Engel, J; Huele, AF+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1996::no title+ERDBRUGGE M+692002 SFB U DORTM+2002::A REVIEW OF ROBUST PROCESS DESIGN APPROACHES+GRIZE, YL+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+JUL-AUG 1995::Optimization of Ford Taurus Wheel Cover Balance (by Design of ExperimentsTaguchi's Method)+Harper, D.; Kosbe, M.; Peyton, L.+Fifth Symposium on Taguchi Methods+1987::no title+KLEINER M+K EINZ HYDR ROHR STR+1999::Robust design via generalized linear models+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2003::PERFORMANCE-MEASURES INDEPENDENT OF ADJUSTMENT - AN EXPLANATION AND EXTENSION OF TAGUCHIS SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS+LEON, RV; SHOEMAKER, AC; KACKER, RN+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1987::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::RESPONSE-SURFACE ALTERNATIVES TO THE TAGUCHI ROBUST PARAMETER DESIGN APPROACH+MYERS, RH; KHURI, AI; VINING, G+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1992::no title+NAIR VN+TECHNOMETRICS+1992::Generalized Linear Models for the Analysis of Taguchi Type Experiments+Nelder, J.A.; Lee, Y.+Applied Stochastic Models and Data Analysis+1991::STRATEGIES FOR ROBUST MULTIRESPONSE QUALITY ENGINEERING+PIGNATIELLO, JJ+IIE TRANSACTIONS+MAY 1993::Exact and approximate REML for heteroscedastic regression+Smyth, Gordon K.; Huele, A.

Integrated risk modelling,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X04st079oa,DEC 2004,22,34,"In this article, we present a new approach to modelling the total economic capital required to protect a financial institution against possible losses. The approach takes into account the correlation between risk types, and in this respect, it improves upon the conventional practice that assumes perfectly correlated risks. A statistical model is built, and Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the total loss distribution. The methodology has been implemented in the Norwegian financial group DnB's system for risk management. Incorporating current expert knowledge of relationships between risks, rather than taking the most conservative stand, gives a 20% reduction in the total economic capital for a one year time horizon.","diversification,integrated risk modelling,Monte Carlo simulation,total economical capital",,"Dimakos, XK@Norwegian Comp Ctr, N-0314 Oslo, Norway::Aas, K@Norwegian Comp Ctr, N-0314 Oslo, Norway","Dimakos, XK@Unknow::Aas, K@Unknow",not exist,"no title+no author+Working Paper on the Regulatory Treatment of Operational Risk+2001::no title+no author+An internal model-based approach to market risk capital requirements+1995::A capital asset pricing model with time-varying covariances+Bollerslev, T.; Engle, R.; Wooldridge, J.+Journal of Political Economy+1998::no title+Crosbie, P.

An important feature of our method is that forecasting is a natural consequence of the smoothing process.

We develop a suitable Bayesian spatio-temporal dynamic linear model for problems such as wall thickness monitoring. We are concerned with problems where the inspection method used collects transformed data, for example minimum regional remaining wall thicknesses.

Marginal models for zero inflated clustered data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X04st076oa,OCT 2004,30,65,"Over the last decade or so, there has been increasing interest in 'zero inflated' (ZI) regression models to account for 'excess' zeros in data. Examples include ZI poisson (ZIP), ZI binomial (ZIB), ZI negative binomial and ZI tobit models. Recently, extensions of these models to the clustered data case have begun to appear. For example, Hall considered ZIP and ZIB models with cluster specific random effects. In this paper, we consider an alternative expectation maximization approach on the basis of marginal models and generalized estimating equation (GEE) methodology. In the usual EM algorithm for fitting ZI models, the M step is replaced by the solution of a GEE to take into account within cluster correlation. The details of this approach, including formulas for an asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of parameter estimates, are given for several of the most important ZI regression model classes.

Nonparametric analysis of replicated microarray experiments,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X04st073oa,OCT 2004,38,2,"Microarrays are part of a new class of biotechnologies, which allow the monitoring of expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. In microarray data analysis, the comparison of gene expression profiles with respect to different conditions and the selection of biologically interesting genes are crucial tasks. Multivariate statistical methods have been applied to analyze these large data sets. To identify genes with altered expression under two experimental conditions, we propose a nonparametric statistical approach. Specifically, we propose estimating the distributions of a t-type statistic and its null statistic, using kernel methods. A comparison of these two distributions by means of a likelihood ratio test can identify genes with significantly changed expressions. A new method to provide more stable estimates of tail probabilities is proposed, as well as a method for the calculation of the cut-off point and the acceptance region. The methodology is applied to a leukaemia data set containing expression levels of 7129 genes, and is compared with normal mixture model and the traditional t-test.","kernel estimator,microarray,mixture modelling,regression modelling,t-test","DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES,STATISTICAL-METHODS,OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ARRAYS,PROFILES,CANCER,MODEL,ESTIMATORS","Gannoun, A@Univ Montpellier 2, UMR CNRS 5149, Equipe Probabilities & Stat, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France@Howard Univ, Dept Microbiol, Washington, DC 20059 USA@Howard Univ, Stat Genet & Bioinformat Unit, Natl Human Genome Ctr, Washington, DC 20059 USA@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Saracco, J@Univ Montpellier 2, UMR CNRS 5149, Equipe Probabilities & Stat, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France@Howard Univ, Dept Microbiol, Washington, DC 20059 USA@Howard Univ, Stat Genet & Bioinformat Unit, Natl Human Genome Ctr, Washington, DC 20059 USA@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Urfer, W@Univ Montpellier 2, UMR CNRS 5149, Equipe Probabilities & Stat, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France@Howard Univ, Dept Microbiol, Washington, DC 20059 USA@Howard Univ, Stat Genet & Bioinformat Unit, Natl Human Genome Ctr, Washington, DC 20059 USA@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Bonney, GE@Univ Montpellier 2, UMR CNRS 5149, Equipe Probabilities & Stat, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France@Howard Univ, Dept Microbiol, Washington, DC 20059 USA@Howard Univ, Stat Genet & Bioinformat Unit, Natl Human Genome Ctr, Washington, DC 20059 USA@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","Gannoun, A@Universite de Montpellier@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)@Howard University@Howard University@Dortmund University of Technology::Saracco, J@Universite de Montpellier@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)@Howard University@Howard University@Dortmund University of Technology::Urfer, W@Universite de Montpellier@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)@Howard University@Howard University@Dortmund University of Technology::Bonney, GE@Universite de Montpellier@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)@Howard University@Howard University@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"A mixture model approach for the analysis of microarray gene expression data+Allison, DB;

Estimating blood vessel areas in ultrasound images using a deformable template model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X04st074oa,OCT 2004,38,3,"We consider the problem of obtaining interval estimates of vessel areas from ultrasound images of cross sections through the carotid artery. Robust and automatic estimates of the cross sectional area is of medical interest and of help in diagnosing atherosclerosis, which is caused by plaque deposits in the carotid artery. We approach this problem by using a deformable template to model the blood vessel outline, and use recent developments in ultrasound science to model the likelihood. We demonstrate that by using an explicit model for the outline, we can easily adjust for an important feature in the data: strong edge reflections called specular reflection. The posterior is challenging to explore, and naive standard MCMC algorithms simply converge too slowly. To obtain an efficient MCMC algorithm we make extensive use of computational efficient Gaussian Markov random fields, and use various block sampling constructions that jointly update large parts of the model.","Gaussian Markov random fields,interval estimates,specular reflection,ultrasound images","BAYESIAN 2-D DECONVOLUTION,MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS,MEDICAL ULTRASOUND,SEGMENTATION,RECOGNITION,SCATTERING,CONTOURS,BOUNDARY","Husby, O@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway::Rue, H@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Husby, O@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)::Rue, H@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)",not exist,"Averaging of random sets based on their distance functions+Baddeley, A; Molchanov, I+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION+JAN 1998::no title+Christensen, Douglas.+Ultrasonic Bioinstrumentation+1988::Stochastic templates for aquaculture images and a parallel pattern detector+de Souza, KMA; Kent, JT; Mardia, KV+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1999::BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION OF VENTRICULAR CONTOURS IN ANGIOGRAPHIC IMAGES+DEFIGUEIREDO, MT; LEITAO, JMN+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING+SEP 1992::Model-based geostatistics+Diggle, PJ; Tawn, JA; Moyeed, RA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1998::Medical image analysis: Progress over two decades and the challenges ahead+Duncan, JS; Ayache, N+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JAN 2000::Ultrasound image segmentation using stochastic templates+Glasbey, C.A.+Journal of Computing and Information Technology - CIT+June 1998::no title+Goodman, J.

Bayesian analysis of extreme events with threshold estimation,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X04st075oa,OCT 2004,27,62,"The aim of this paper is to analyse extremal events using generalized Pareto distributions (GPD), considering explicitly the uncertainty about the threshold. Current practice empirically determines this quantity and proceeds by estimating the GPD parameters on the basis of data beyond it, discarding all the information available below the threshold. We introduce a mixture model that combines a parametric form for the center and a GPD for the tail of the distributions and uses all observations for inference about the unknown parameters from both distributions, the threshold included. Prior distributions for the parameters are indirectly obtained through experts quantiles elicitation. Posterior inference is available through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Simulations are carried out in order to analyse the performance of our proposed model under a wide range of scenarios. Those scenarios approximate realistic situations found in the literature. We also apply the proposed model to a real dataset, Nasdaq 100, an index of the financial market that presents many extreme events.

Joint modelling of location and scale parameters of the t distribution,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X04st068oa,JUL 2004,45,35,"Joint modelling of location and scale parameters has generally been confined to exponential families. In this paper the location and scale parameters of the t distribution are allowed to depend on covariates. The closed form of the likelihood allows inference to proceed in a similar fashion to the Gaussian location and scale model and provides a framework for a simple scoring algorithm to estimate the parameters. The algorithm includes a procedure to estimate the degrees of freedom parameter of the t distribution. Homogeneity and asymptotic tests are discussed and a methodology is derived to detect heteroscedasticity when the response is t distributed. Simulations reveal considerable bias in the estimates of the degrees of freedom parameter and only minor bias in the estimated fixed effects associated with the scale parameter. In comparison, the estimated location effects are well behaved.

We employ a mixed effects model, including a term for spatial correlation, which assumes a continuous underlying scale of grazing impact, and where the classification into discrete categories is made via cut-points. We analyse two classes of data: full census data and sample data drawn from the full census. In the latter case, we show that the estimation of nonsampled data improves as the spatial information included within the model increases.","assessment of model predictions,Bayesian spatial modelling,grazing animals,Markov chain Monte Carlo,ordinal response",MARGINAL MODELS,"Brewer, MJ@Biomath & Stat Scotland, Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland::Elston, DA@Biomath & Stat Scotland, Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland::Hodgson, MEA@Biomath & Stat Scotland, Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland::Stolte, AM@Biomath & Stat Scotland, Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland::Nolan, AJ@Biomath & Stat Scotland, Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland::Henderson, DJ@Biomath & Stat Scotland, Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland","Brewer, MJ@James Hutton Institute::Elston, DA@James Hutton Institute::Hodgson, MEA@James Hutton Institute::Stolte, AM@James Hutton Institute::Nolan, AJ@James Hutton Institute::Henderson, DJ@James Hutton Institute","Brewer, Mark@I-7226-2013::Elston, David@H-8199-2013","no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data+1984::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::no title+Best, N.

"A general multilevel multistate competing risks model for event history data, with an application to a study of contraceptive use dynamics",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X04st069oa,JUL 2004,20,59,"We propose a general discrete time model for multilevel event history data. The model is developed for the analysis of longitudinal repeated episodes within individuals where there are multiple states and multiple types of event (competing risks) which may vary across states. The different transitions are modelled jointly to allow for correlation across transitions in unobserved individual risk factors. Implementation of the methodology using existing multilevel models for discrete response data is described. The model is applied in an analysis of contraceptive use dynamics in Indonesia where transitions from two states, contraceptive use and nonuse, are of interest. A distinction is made between two ways in which an episode of contraceptive use may end: a transition to nonuse or a switch to another method. Before adjusting for covariate effects, there is a strong negative residual correlation between the hazards of a transition from use to nonuse and from nonuse to use; this correlation is due to a tendency for short periods of nonuse after a birth to be followed by long periods of using the same contraceptive method.","competing risks,contraceptive use,event history analysis,multilevel model,multistate model","PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL,CHILD SURVIVAL,DURATION","Steele, F@Univ London, Inst Educ, Ctr Multilevel Modeling, London WC1H 0AL, England@Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Goldstein, H@Univ London, Inst Educ, Ctr Multilevel Modeling, London WC1H 0AL, England@Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Browne, W@Univ London, Inst Educ, Ctr Multilevel Modeling, London WC1H 0AL, England@Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Steele, F@University of London@University College London@University of Nottingham::Goldstein, H@University of London@University College London@University of Nottingham::Browne, W@University of London@University College London@University of Nottingham","Browne, William@A-8686-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6659-6885::Goldstein, Harvey@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3878-4122","Logistic models for binary and binomial responses+Browne, W; Steele, F; Rasbash, J.+A user's guide to MLwiN.

Protective estimator for linear regression with nonignorably missing Gaussian outcomes,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X04st066oa,APR 2004,14,3,"We propose a method for estimating the regression parameters in a linear regression model for Gaussian data when the outcome variable is missing for some subjects and missingness is thought to be nonignorable. Throughout, we assume that missingness is restricted to the outcome variable and that the covariates are fully observed. Although maximum likelihood estimation of the regression parameters is possible once joint models for the outcome variable and the nonignorable missing data mechanism have been specified, these models are fundamentally nonidentifiable unless unverifiable modeling assumptions are imposed. In this paper, rather than explicitly modeling the nonignorable missingness mechanism, we consider the use of a 'protective' estimator of the regression parameters (Brown, 1990). To implement the proposed method, it is necessary to assume that the outcome variable and one of the covariates have an approximate bivariate normal distribution, conditional on the remaining covariates. In addition, it is assumed that the missing data mechanism is conditionally independent of this covariate, given the outcome variable and the remaining covariates; the latter is referred to as the 'protective' assumption. A method of moments approach is used to obtain the protective estimator of the regression parameters; the jackknife (Quenouille, 1956) is used to estimate the variance. The method is illustrated using data on the persistence of maternal smoking from the Six Cities Study of the health effects of air pollution (Ware et al., 1984). The results of a simulation study are presented that examine the magnitude of any finite sample bias.","EM-algorithm,method of moments,nonignorable missing data,ordinary least squares","INCOMPLETE DATA,DATA MECHANISM,NONRESPONSE,VARIABLES,MODELS","Lipsitz, SR@Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biometry & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Dana Farber Canc Inst, Div Biostat Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Molenberghs, G@Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biometry & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Dana Farber Canc Inst, Div Biostat Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Fitzmaurice, GM@Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biometry & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Dana Farber Canc Inst, Div Biostat Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Ibrahim, JG@Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biometry & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Dana Farber Canc Inst, Div Biostat Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Lipsitz, SR@Medical University of South Carolina@Hasselt University@Harvard University@VA Boston Healthcare System@Dana-Farber Cancer Institute@Harvard University::Molenberghs, G@Medical University of South Carolina@Hasselt University@Harvard University@VA Boston Healthcare System@Dana-Farber Cancer Institute@Harvard University::Fitzmaurice, GM@Medical University of South Carolina@Hasselt University@Harvard University@VA Boston Healthcare System@Dana-Farber Cancer Institute@Harvard University::Ibrahim, JG@Medical University of South Carolina@Hasselt University@Harvard University@VA Boston Healthcare System@Dana-Farber Cancer Institute@Harvard University",not exist,"REGRESSION-ANALYSIS FOR CATEGORICAL VARIABLES WITH OUTCOME SUBJECT TO NONIGNORABLE NONRESPONSE+BAKER, SG; LAIRD, NM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1988::PROTECTING AGAINST NONRANDOMLY MISSING DATA IN LONGITUDINAL-STUDIES+BROWN, CH+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1990::On transformations used in the analysis of variance+Curtiss, JH+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1943::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+IBRAHIM JG+BIOMETRICS+1999::Parameter estimation from incomplete data in binomial regression when the missing data mechanism is nonignorable+Ibrahim, JG; Lipsitz, SR+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1996::Missing covariates in generalized linear models when the missing data mechanism is non-ignorable+Ibrahim, JG; Lipsitz, SR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::no title+Little, R.

A special MSARM with two harmonic components is proposed to analyse periodic time series. We present a full Bayesian analysis based on a Gibbs sampling algorithm for model choice and the estimations of the unknown parameters, missing data and predictive distributions. The implementation and modelling steps are developed by tackling the problem of the hidden states labeling by means of random permutation sampling and constrained permutation sampling. We apply MSARMs to study a data set about air pollution that presents periodicities since the hourly mean concentration of carbon monoxide varies according to the dynamics of the 24 day-hours and of the year. Hence, we introduce in the model both a hidden state-dependent daily component and a state-independent yearly component, giving rise to periodic MSARMs.","hidden Markov chain,harmonic components,Gibbs sampling,label switching,permutation sampling,carbon monoxide","POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,MIXTURE-MODELS","Spezia, L@Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Stat, I-20123 Milan, Italy@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens, Greece::Paroli, R@Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Stat, I-20123 Milan, Italy@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens, Greece::Dellaportas, P@Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Stat, I-20123 Milan, Italy@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens, Greece","Spezia, L@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart@Athens University of Economics & Business::Paroli, R@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart@Athens University of Economics & Business::Dellaportas, P@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart@Athens University of Economics & Business",not exist,"Bayesian estimation of switching ARMA models+Billio, M; Monfort, A; Robert, CP+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 1999::ON GIBBS SAMPLING FOR STATE-SPACE MODELS+CARTER, CK; KOHN, R+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::Computational and inferential difficulties with mixture posterior distributions.+Celeux, G; Hurn, M; Robert, CP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::Calculating posterior distributions and modal estimates in Markov mixture models+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1996::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::no title+Franses, Philip H; van Dijk, Dick.+Non-linear Time Series Models in Empirical Finance+2000::Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation of classical and dynamic switching and mixture models+Fruhwirth-Schnatter, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Data Augmentation and Dynamic Linear Models+Fruhwirth-Schnatter, Sylvia.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1994::no title+FRUHWIRTHSCHNAT.S+199971 VIENN U EC BU+1999::no title+Hamilton, JD.+Time series analysis+1994::BAYES FACTORS+KASS, RE; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::no title+Kim, C.

MCMC model determination for discrete graphical models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X04st063oa,APR 2004,26,9,"In this paper we compare two alternative MCMC samplers for the Bayesian analysis of discrete graphical models; we present both a hierarchical and a nonhierarchical version of them.

We then describe a novel methodology based on a reversible jump sampler. As a prior distribution we assign, for each given graph, a hyper-Dirichlet distribution on the matrix of cell probabilities.

We focus on an extension of Markovian epidemic models, allowing the infectious period of an individual to follow a Weibull distribution, resulting in a more flexible model for many diseases. Following a Bayesian approach we show how approximation methods can be applied to design efficient MCMC algorithms with favourable mixing properties for fitting non-Markovian models to partial observations of epidemic processes. The methodology is used to analyse real data concerning a smallpox outbreak in a human population, and a simulation study is conducted to assess the effects of the frequency and accuracy of diagnostic tests on the information yielded on the epidemic process.","Bayesian inference,diagnostic tests,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Metropolis-Hastings acceptance rate,non-Markovian model,stochastic epidemic modelling",MODELS,"Streftaris, G@Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland::Gibson, GJ@Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland","Streftaris, G@Heriot Watt University::Gibson, GJ@Heriot Watt University","Streftaris, George@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5821-9588","no title+Bailey, NTJ.+The Mathematical Theory of Infectious Diseases and Its Applications+1975::Analysis of variations in an infection rate+Becker, N.

The distribution is a form of weighted Poisson distribution and is shown to have advantages over other weighted Poisson distributions that have been proposed to model underdispersion. One key difference is that the weights in our distribution are centred on the mean of the underlying Poisson distribution.

"Generalized log-linear models with random effects, with application to smoothing contingency tables",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X03st059oa,DEC 2003,40,4,"We define a class of generalized log-linear models with random effects. For a vector of Poisson or multinomial means mu and matrices of constants C and A, the model has the form C log Amu = Xbeta + Zu, where beta are fixed effects and u are random effects. The model contains most standard models currently used for categorical data analysis. We suggest some new models that are special cases of this model and are useful for applications such as smoothing large contingency tables and modeling heterogeneity in odds ratios. We present examples of its use for such applications. In many cases, maximum likelihood model fitting can be handled with existing methods and software. We outline extensions of model fitting methods for other cases. We also summarize several challenges for future research, such as fitting the model in its most general form and deriving properties of estimates used in smoothing contingency tables.","association model,generalized linear mixed model,marginal model,mixture model,multinomial,logit model,ordinal data,overdispersion,Poisson","MULTIVARIATE CATEGORICAL RESPONSES,MONTE-CARLO EM,ORDERED CATEGORIES,REGRESSION-MODELS,MIXED MODELS,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,CROSS-CLASSIFICATIONS,LIKELIHOOD,ASSOCIATION,BIVARIATE","Coull, BA@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Agresti, A@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Coull, BA@Harvard University@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Agresti, A@Harvard University@State University System of Florida@University of Florida",not exist,"A general maximum likelihood analysis of overdispersion in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+SEP 1996::Marginal models for categorical data+Bergsma, WP;

This paper demonstrates how the inflorescence structure can be modelled concisely using binomial logistic generalized linear mixed models.

The main methods are reviewed and compared for fitting binomial logistic generalized linear mixed models to strawberry inflorescence data. Simulations matched to the original data are used to show that a modified EM method due to Steele (1996) is clearly the best, in terms of speed and mean-squared-error performance, for data of this kind.","correlated binomial,Gauss-Hermite quadrature,GLMMs,Laplace importance sampling,modified EM,penalized likelihood,random effects,simulated maximum likelihood,variance components","BIAS CORRECTION,EM ALGORITHM,COMPONENT,APPROXIMATION,VARIABILITY,DISPERSION","Cole, DJ@Univ Kent, Inst Math & Stat, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England::Morgan, BJT@Univ Kent, Inst Math & Stat, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England::Ridout, MS@Univ Kent, Inst Math & Stat, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England","Cole, DJ@University of Kent::Morgan, BJT@University of Kent::Ridout, MS@University of Kent","Ridout, Martin@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7233-2985","no title+ABRAMOWITZ M+HBS MATH FUNCTIONS+1965::VARIANCE COMPONENT MODELS WITH BINARY RESPONSE - INTERVIEWER VARIABILITY+ANDERSON, DA; AITKIN, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1985::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::BIAS CORRECTION IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS WITH A SINGLE-COMPONENT OF DISPERSION+BRESLOW, NE; LIN, XH+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1995::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+COLE DJ+THESIE U KENT CANTER+2003::A simple illustration of the failure of PQL, IRREML and APHL as approximate ML methods for mixed models for binary data+Engel, B+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1998::no title+ENGEL B+BIOMETRICS+1998::no title+ENGEL B+P 13 INT BIOM C INV+1996::no title+ENGEL B+P 14 INT BIOM C CONT+1998::no title+ENGEL B+STAT NEERL+1994::Laplace importance sampling for generalized linear mixed models+Kuk, AYC+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1999::Hierarchical generalized linear models+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Variance component testing in generalised linear models with random effects+Lin, XH+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1997::Bias correction in generalized linear mixed models with multiple components of dispersion+Lin, XH; Breslow, NE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1996::WinBUGS - A Bayesian modelling framework: Concepts, structure, and extensibility+Lunn, DJ; Thomas, A; Best, N; et al.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+OCT 2000::no title+McCulloch, C; Searle, A.+Generalized, linear and mixed models+2001::Maximum likelihood algorithms for generalized linear mixed models+McCulloch, CE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::ESTIMATION IN GENERALIZED MIXED MODELS+MCGILCHRIST, CA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1994::Two-staged estimation of variance components in generalized linear mixed models+Pawitan, Y+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2001::Modelling variability in the branching structure of strawberry inflorescences+Ridout, MS; Morgan, BJT; Taylor, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1999::ESTIMATION IN GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS WITH RANDOM EFFECTS+SCHALL, R+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1991::no title+Spiegelhalter, David J.; Thomas, Andrew; Best, Nicky G.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Gilks, Wally R</span>.+BUGS: Bayesian Inference Using Gibbs Sampling+1996::A modified EM algorithm for estimation in generalized mixed models+Steele, BM+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1996::LAPLACES APPROXIMATION FOR NONLINEAR MIXED MODELS+WOLFINGER, R+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1993::MODELS FOR LONGITUDINAL DATA - A GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATION APPROACH+ZEGER, SL; LIANG, KY; ALBERT, PS+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1988::GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS WITH RANDOM EFFECTS - A GIBBS SAMPLING APPROACH+ZEGER, SL; KARIM, MR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1991::Analysis of generalized linear mixed models via a stochastic approximation algorithm with Markov chain Monte-Carlo method+Zhu, HT; Lee, SY+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+APR 2002"

We do not adopt a parametric specification for the random coefficients distribution and this allows us to overcome inconsistencies due to misspecification of this component. Model parameters are estimated by means of an EM algorithm for nonparametric maximum likelihood (NPML), which is extended to deal with serial correlation among repeated measures, with an explicit focus on those situations where short individual time series have been observed.

Point and interval estimation of the population size using the truncated Poisson regression model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X03st057oa,DEC 2003,16,38,A method is presented to derive point and interval estimates of the total number of individuals in a heterogenous Poisson population. The method is based on the Horvitz-Thompson approach. The zero-truncated Poisson regression model is fitted and results are used to obtain point and interval estimates for the total number of individuals in the population. The method is assessed by performing a simulation experiment computing coverage probabilities of Horvitz-Thompson confidence intervals for cases with different sample sizes and Poisson parameters.

Modelling paired release-recovery data in the presence of survival and capture heterogeneity with application to marked juvenile salmon,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X03st055oa,OCT 2003,17,13,"Products of multinomial models have been the standard approach to analysing animal release-recovery data. Two alternatives, a pseudo-likelihood model and a Bayesian nonlinear hierarchical model, are developed. Both approaches can to some degree account for heterogeneity in survival and capture probabilities over and above that accounted for by covariates. The pseudo-likelihood approach allows for recovery period specific overdispersion. The hierarchical approach treats survival and capture rates as a sum of fixed and random effects. The standard and alternative approaches were applied to a set of paired release-recovery salmon data. Marked juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were released, with some recovered in freshwater as juveniles and others in marine waters as adults. Interest centered on modelling freshwater survival rates as a function of biological and hydrological covariates. Under the product multinomial formulation, most covariates were statistically significant. In contrast, under the pseudo-likelihood and hierarchical formulations, the standard errors for the coefficients were considerably larger, with pseudo-likelihood standard errors five to eight times larger, and fewer coefficients were statistically significant. Covariates, significant under all formulations, with important management implications included water temperature, water flow and amount of water exported for human use. The hierarchical model was considerably more stable with regard to estimated coefficients of training subsets used in a cross-validation.","band-recovery models,hierarchical,Markov chain Monte Carlo,mixed effects,pseudo-likelihood",ANIMALS,"Newman, KB@Univ St Andrews, CREEM, St Andrews KY16 9LZ, Fife, Scotland","Newman, KB@University of St Andrews",not exist,"ESTIMATING THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON THE SURVIVAL OF CHINOOK SALMON SMOLTS (ONCORHYNCHUS-TSHAWYTSCHA) MIGRATING THROUGH THE SACRAMENTO-SAN-JOAQUIN RIVER DELTA OF CALIFORNIA+BAKER, PF; SPEED, TP; LIGON, FK+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES+APR 1995::no title+Brownie, C; Anderson, DR; Burnham, KP<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Robson, DS</span>.+Statistical inference from band recovery data: A Handbook+1985::no title+CARROLL, R.

Negative binomial loglinear mixed models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X03st058oa,OCT 2003,22,58,"The Poisson loglinear model is a common choice for explaining variability in counts. However, in many practical circumstances the restriction that the mean and variance are equal is not realistic. Overdispersion with respect to the Poisson distribution can be modeled explicitly by integrating with respect to a mixture distribution, and use of the conjugate gamma mixing distribution leads to a negative binomial loglinear model. This paper extends the negative binomial loglinear model to the case of dependent counts, where dependence among the counts is handled by including linear combinations of random effects in the linear predictor. If we assume that the vector of random effects is multivariate normal, then complex forms of dependence can be modelled by appropriate specification of the covariance structure. Although the likelihood function for the resulting model is not tractable, maximum likelihood estimates (and standard errors) can be found using the NLMIXED procedure in SAS or, in more complicated examples, using a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. An alternate approach is to leave the random effects completely unspecified and attempt to estimate them using nonparametric maximum likelihood. The methodologies are illustrated with several examples.","Monte Carlo EM,NLMIXED procedure,nonparametric maximum likelihood,over-dispersion,random effects","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ANALYSIS,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,EM ALGORITHM,OVERDISPERSION","Booth, JG@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Graz Tech Univ, Inst Stat, A-8010 Graz, Austria::Casella, G@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Graz Tech Univ, Inst Stat, A-8010 Graz, Austria::Friedl, H@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Graz Tech Univ, Inst Stat, A-8010 Graz, Austria::Hobert, JP@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Graz Tech Univ, Inst Stat, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Booth, JG@University of Florida@State University System of Florida@Graz University of Technology::Casella, G@University of Florida@State University System of Florida@Graz University of Technology::Friedl, H@University of Florida@State University System of Florida@Graz University of Technology::Hobert, JP@University of Florida@State University System of Florida@Graz University of Technology","Friedl, Herwig@C-2493-2013","A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::A general maximum likelihood analysis of overdispersion in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+SEP 1996::Random coefficient models for binary longitudinal responses with attrition+Alfo, M; Aitkin, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+OCT 2000::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+CAFFO BS+ASCENT BASED MONTE C+2002::no title+CASELLA G+EVALUATION ENTRAINME+1985::SOME REMARKS ON OVERDISPERSION+COX, DR+BIOMETRIKA+1983::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::CONSISTENCY OF THE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR IN THE PRESENCE OF INFINITELY MANY INCIDENTAL PARAMETERS+KIEFER, J; WOLFOWITZ, J+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1956::NONPARAMETRIC MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF A MIXING DISTRIBUTION+LAIRD, N+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1978::A comparison of Poisson, negative binomial, and semiparametric mixed Poisson regression models - With empirical applications to criminal careers data+Land, KC; McCall, PL; Nagin, DS+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1996::THE GEOMETRY OF MIXTURE LIKELIHOODS - A GENERAL-THEORY+LINDSAY, BG+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1983::FINDING THE OBSERVED INFORMATION MATRIX WHEN USING THE EM ALGORITHM+LOUIS, TA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::Maximum likelihood algorithms for generalized linear mixed models+McCulloch, CE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::no title+Robert, C.P.; Casella, G.+Monte Carlo Statistical Methods+1999::no title+no author+SAS/STAT software: Changes and enhancements through Release 6. 12, Cary+1997::SOME COVARIANCE-MODELS FOR LONGITUDINAL COUNT DATA WITH OVERDISPERSION+THALL, PF; VAIL, SC+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1990::no title+Venables, W.; Ripley, B.

We identify four distributional categories into which such data can be put, and focus on regression models for the first category, for proportions observed on the open interval (0, 1). For these data, we identify different specifications used in prior research and compare these specifications using two common samples and specifications of the regressors. Based upon our analysis, we recommend that researchers use either a parametric regression model based upon the beta distribution or a quasi-likelihood regression model developed by Papke and Wooldridge (1997) for these data. Concerning the choice between these two regression models, we recommend that researchers use the parametric regression model unless their sample size is large enough to justify the asymptotic arguments underlying the quasi-likelihood approach.","fractions,percentages,proportions,regression","BETA-DISTRIBUTION,MODELS,CABLE,SERVICES","Kieschnick, R@Univ Texas, Dept Finance & Managerial Econ, Richardson, TX 75083 USA@Drexel Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::McCullough, BD@Univ Texas, Dept Finance & Managerial Econ, Richardson, TX 75083 USA@Drexel Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Kieschnick, R@University of Texas Dallas@University of Texas System@Drexel University::McCullough, BD@University of Texas Dallas@University of Texas System@Drexel University",not exist,"no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::MARKETING CABLE AND PAY CABLE SERVICES - IMPACT OF ETHNICITY, VIEWING MOTIVATIONS, AND PROGRAM TYPES+ALBARRAN, AB; UMPHREY, D+JOURNAL OF MEDIA ECONOMICS+1994::no title+ATKIN DJ+TELEMATICS INFORMATI+1992::no title+Atkinson, A.

Correcting for covariate measurement error in logistic regression using nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X03st056oa,OCT 2003,47,36,"When covariates are measured with error, inference based on conventional generalized linear models can yield biased estimates of regression parameters. This problem can potentially be rectified by using generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM), including a measurement model for the relationship between observed and true covariates. However, the models are typically estimated under the assumption that both the true covariates and the measurement errors are normally distributed, although skewed covariate distributions are often observed in practice. In this article we relax the normality assumption for the true covariates by developing nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation (NPMLE) for GLLAMMs. The methodology is applied to estimating the effect of dietary fibre intake on coronary heart disease. We also assess the performance of estimation of regression parameters and empirical Bayes prediction of the true covariate. Normal as well as skewed covariate distributions are simulated and inference is performed based on both maximum likelihood assuming normality and NPMLE. Both estimators are unbiased and have similar root mean square errors when the true covariate is normal. With a skewed covariate, the conventional estimator is biased but has a smaller mean square error than the NPMLE. NPMLE produces substantially improved empirical Bayes predictions of the true covariate when its distribution is skewed.","empirical Bayes prediction,factor model,generalized linear models,GLLAMM,logistic regression,measurement error,nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,COMPOUND POISSON-PROCESS,DISTRIBUTIONS,VARIABLES","Rabe-Hesketh, S@Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Biostat & Comp, London SE5 8AF, England@Univ Manchester, Sch Epidemiol & Hlth Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England@Univ Manchester, CCSR, Manchester, Lancs, England@Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Oslo, Norway::Pickles, A@Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Biostat & Comp, London SE5 8AF, England@Univ Manchester, Sch Epidemiol & Hlth Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England@Univ Manchester, CCSR, Manchester, Lancs, England@Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Oslo, Norway::Skrondal, A@Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Biostat & Comp, London SE5 8AF, England@Univ Manchester, Sch Epidemiol & Hlth Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England@Univ Manchester, CCSR, Manchester, Lancs, England@Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Oslo, Norway","Rabe-Hesketh, S@Kings College London@University of London@University of Manchester@University of Manchester@Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)::Pickles, A@Kings College London@University of London@University of Manchester@University of Manchester@Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)::Skrondal, A@Kings College London@University of London@University of Manchester@University of Manchester@Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)","Skrondal, Anders@C-7342-2008::Pickles, Andrew@A-9625-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1283-0346::Rabe-Hesketh, Sophia@B-1643-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5257-4837","A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::A general maximum likelihood analysis of measurement error in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M; Rocci, R+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+APR 2002::A general maximum likelihood analysis of overdispersion in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+SEP 1996::FITTING A RESPONSE MODEL FOR N DICHOTOMOUSLY SCORED ITEMS+BOCK, RD; LIEBERMAN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1970::CONVERGENCE OF SIMAR ALGORITHM FOR FINDING THE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATE OF A COMPOUND POISSON-PROCESS+BOHNING, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::no title+Bohning, D.+Computer-assisted Analysis of Mixtures and Applications: Meta-analysis, Disease Mapping and Others+2000::A COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT QUADRATURE PROCEDURE FOR THE ONE-FACTOR MULTINOMIAL PROBIT MODEL+BUTLER, JS; MOFFITT, R+ECONOMETRICA+1982::RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS WITH NONPARAMETRIC PRIORS+BUTLER, SM; LOUIS, TA+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT-NOV 1992::no title+CLAYTON DG+STAT MODELS LONGITUD+1992::SMOOTH NONPARAMETRIC MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION FOR POPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS, WITH APPLICATION TO QUINIDINE+DAVIDIAN, M; GALLANT, AR+JOURNAL OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS+OCT 1992::A JOINT TRIP TIMING STORE-TYPE CHOICE MODEL FOR GROCERY SHOPPING, INCLUDING INVENTORY EFFECTS AND NONPARAMETRIC CONTROL FOR OMITTED VARIABLES+DAVIES, RB; PICKLES, AR+TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE+JUL-SEP 1987::no title+Dunn, G.+Design and analysis of reliability studies: the statistical evaluation of measurement errors+1989::GENERALIZING LOGISTIC-REGRESSION BY NONPARAMETRIC MIXING+FOLLMANN, DA; LAMBERT, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1989::SEMI-NONPARAMETRIC MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION+GALLANT, AR; NYCHKA, DW+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1987::A METHOD FOR MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF DISTRIBUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS IN ECONOMETRIC-MODELS FOR DURATION DATA+HECKMAN, J; SINGER, B+ECONOMETRICA+1984::no title+HINDE JP+LONGITUDINAL DATA AN+1987::Estimating the parameters in the Cox model when covariate variables are measured with error+Hu, P; Tsiatis, AA; Davidian, M+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1998::MIXTURES OF EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTIONS+JEWELL, NP+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::NONPARAMETRIC MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF A MIXING DISTRIBUTION+LAIRD, N+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1978::On the effect of the number of quadrature points in a logistic random-effects model: an example+Lesaffre, E; Spiessens, B+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2001::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION IN THE RASCH MODEL AND RELATED EXPONENTIAL RESPONSE MODELS, INCLUDING A SIMPLE LATENT CLASS MODEL FOR ITEM ANALYSIS+LINDSAY, B; CLOGG, CC; GREGO, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1991::THE GEOMETRY OF MIXTURE LIKELIHOODS .2.

A mixed model formulation for designing cluster randomized trials with binary outcomes,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X03st054oa,OCT 2003,42,2,"Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are unlike traditional individually randomized trials because observations within the same cluster are positively correlated and the sample size (number of clusters) is relatively small. Although formulae for sample size and power estimates of CRT designs do exist, these formulae rely upon first-order asymptotic approximations for the distribution of the average intervention effect and are inaccurate for CRTs that have a small number of clusters. These formulae also assume that the intracluster correlation (ICC) is the same for each cluster in the CRT. However, for CRTs in which the clusters are classrooms or medical practices, the degree of ICC is often a factor of how many students are in each classroom or how many patients are in each practice. Specifically, smaller clusters are expected to have larger ICC than larger clusters. A weighted sum of the cluster means, D, is the statistic often used to estimate the average intervention effect in a CRT. Therefore, we propose that a saddlepoint approximation is a natural choice to approximate the distributions of the cluster means more precisely than a standard large-sample approximation. We parameterize the ICC for each cluster as a random effect with a predefined prior distribution that is dependent upon the size of each cluster. After integrating over the range of the random effect, we use Monte Carlo methods to generate sample cluster means, which are in turn used to approximate the distribution of D with saddlepoint methods. Through numerical examples and an actual application, we show that our method has accuracy that is equal to or better than that of existing methods. Futhermore, our method accommodates CRTs in which the correlation within cluster is expected to diminish with the cluster size.","marginal model,power,saddlepoint approximation,sample size","SAMPLE-SIZE CALCULATIONS,GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS,INTERVENTION TRIALS,POWER CALCULATIONS,LINEAR-MODELS,PRIMARY-CARE,ADJUSTMENTS,PARAMETERS,ESTIMATOR,RESPONSES","Braun, TM@Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Braun, TM@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan",not exist,"Optimal permutation tests for the analysis of group randomized trials+Braun, TM; Feng, ZD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Sample size calculations for cluster randomised trials.

Extensions of the Bartlett-Lewis model for rainfall processes,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X02st049oa,JUL 2003,19,6,"While the Bartlett-Lewis model has been widely used for modelling rainfall processes at a fixed point in space over time, there are observed features, such as longer-scale dependence, which are not well fitted by the model. In this paper, we study an extension where we put an extra layer in the clustered Poisson process of storm origins. We also investigate the Pareto inter-arrival time for the storm origins, which has been used to model web-traffic data. We derive the theoretical first and second-order properties of the multi-layer clustered Poisson processes, but generally we have to rely on Monte Carlo techniques. The models are fitted to hourly rainfall data from Valentia observatory in southwest Ireland, where the extensions are shown to improve on the standard models. We generalize these models further by allowing some parameters of the models to be a function of some covariates. An application using data from Valentia observatory and Belmullet shows how to use this class of models to analyze the association between the rainfall pattern and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index.","rainfall,Bartlett-Lewis models,long-range dependence,multi-layer structure,NAO index","POINT-PROCESSES,PRECIPITATION","Salim, A@Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Stat, Cork, Ireland@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol, Stockholm, Sweden::Pawitan, Y@Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Stat, Cork, Ireland@Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol, Stockholm, Sweden","Salim, A@University College Cork@Karolinska Institutet::Pawitan, Y@University College Cork@Karolinska Institutet","Salim, Agus@A-2553-2008::Salim, Agus@P-1407-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3999-7701","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::A STOCHASTIC METHOD FOR GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION+BOENDER, CGE; KAN, AHGR; TIMMER, GT; et al.+MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING+1982::no title+Brillinger, D.

Likelihood-based analysis of longitudinal count data using a generalized Poisson model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X03st050oa,JUL 2003,14,10,"Models based on a generalization of the simple Poisson process are discussed and illustrated with an analysis of some longitudinal count data on frequencies of epileptic fits. The models enable a broad class of discrete distributions to be constructed, which cover a variety of dispersion properties that can be characterized in an intuitive and appealing way by a simple parameterization. This class includes the Poisson and negative binomial distributions as well as other distributions with greater dispersion than Poisson, and also distributions underdispersed relative to the Poisson distribution. Comparing a number of analyses of the data shows that some covariates have a more significant effect using this modelling than from using mixed Poisson models. It is argued that this could be due to the mixed Poisson models used in the other analyses not providing an appropriate description of the residual variation, with the greater flexibility of the generalized Poisson modelling generally enabling more critical assessment of covariate effects than more standard mixed Poisson modelling.","longitudinal data,negative binomial distribution,overdispersion,Poisson distribution,transition models,underdispersion",LINEAR-MODELS,"Toscas, PJ@CSIRO Math & Informat Sci, Cleveland, Qld 4163, Australia@Univ Birmingham, Sch Math & Stat, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England::Faddy, MJ@CSIRO Math & Informat Sci, Cleveland, Qld 4163, Australia@Univ Birmingham, Sch Math & Stat, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Toscas, PJ@Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)@University of Birmingham::Faddy, MJ@Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)@University of Birmingham","Toscas, Peter@E-6524-2010","no title+*APT SYST INC+GAUSSTM COMM REF+1996::A note on variation in birth processes+Ball, F.+Math.

Use of fractional polynomials for dose-response modelling and quantitative risk assessment in developmental toxicity studies,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X03st051oa,JUL 2003,23,12,"Developmental toxicity studies are designed to assess the potential adverse effects of an exposure on developing fetuses. Safe dose levels can be determined using dose-response modelling. To this end, it is important to investigate the effect of misspecifying the dose-response model on the safe dose. Since classical polynomial predictors are often of poor quality, there is a clear need for alternative specifications of the predictors, such as fractional polynomials. By means of simulations, we will show how fractional polynomial predictors may resolve possible model misspecifications and may thus yield more reliable estimates of the benchmark doses.","benchmark dose,beta-binomial model,conditional model,developmental toxicity,dose-response,fractional polynomials","MULTIVARIATE BINARY DATA,LIKELIHOOD,GLYCOL,MICE","Faes, C@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Stat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Biostat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Geys, H@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Stat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Biostat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Aerts, M@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Stat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Biostat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Molenberghs, G@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Stat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Limburgs Univ Ctr, Ctr Biostat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium","Faes, C@Hasselt University@Hasselt University::Geys, H@Hasselt University@Hasselt University::Aerts, M@Hasselt University@Hasselt University::Molenberghs, G@Hasselt University@Hasselt University","Faes, Christel@E-1384-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1878-9869","Likelihood misspecification and safe dose determination for clustered binary data+Aerts, M; Declerck, L; Molenberghs, G+ENVIRONMETRICS+NOV-DEC 1997::no title+Aerts, M.; Geys, H.; Molenberghs, G.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Ryan, L</span>.+Topics in Modelling of Clustered Data+2002::Two generalizations of the binomial distribution+Altham, P.

Multilevel ordinal models for examination grades,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X03st052oa,JUL 2003,37,23,In multilevel situations graded category responses are often converted to points scores and linear models for continuous normal responses fitted. This is particularly prevalent in educational research. Generalized multilevel ordinal models for response categories are developed and contrasted in some respects with these normal models. Attention is given to the analysis of a large database of the General Certificate of Education Advanced Level examinations in England and Wales. Ordinal models appear to have advantages in facilitating the study of institutional differences in more detail. Of particular importance is the flexibility offered by logit models with nonproportionally changing odds. Examples are given of the richer contrasts of institutional and subgroup differences that may be evaluated.

We first estimate parameters in all models by optimizing goodness-of-fit to a dataset. Then, to assess a candidate model, we simulate a population of datasets from it and evaluate the goodness-of-fit of all the models, without re-estimating parameter values. Finally, we see whether the vector of goodness-of-fit criteria for the original data is compatible with the multivariate distribution of these criteria for the simulated datasets. By simulating from each model in turn, we determine whether any, or several, models are consistent with the data. We apply the method to compare three models, fit at different temporal resolutions to binary time series of animal behaviour data, concluding that a semi-Markov model gives a better fit than latent Gaussian and hidden Markov models.","binary time series,hidden Markov model,latent Gaussian model,Mahalanobis distance,model comparison,semi-Markov model","HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS,DAIRY-COWS,SELECTION,CHOICE","Allcroft, DJ@Biomath & Stat Scot, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ, Midlothian, Scotland::Glasbey, CA@Biomath & Stat Scot, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ, Midlothian, Scotland","Allcroft, DJ@James Hutton Institute::Glasbey, CA@James Hutton Institute",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::A spectral estimator of ARMA parameters from thresholded data+Allcroft, DJ; Glasbey, CA+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+OCT 2002::no title+ALLCROFT DJ+THESIS U EDINBURGH+2001::no title+ALLCROFT DJ+UNPUB IMPORTANT MEMO+2003::METHOD FOR DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN MODELS+ATKINSON, AC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1970::no title+Cox, D.

Reduced-rank vector generalized linear models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X03st045oa,MAR 2003,38,60,"Reduced-rank regression is a method with great potential for dimension reduction but has found few applications in applied statistics. To address this, reduced-rank regression is proposed for the class of vector generalized linear models (VGLMs), which is very large. The resulting class, which we call reduced-rank VGLMs (RR-VGLMs), enables the benefits of reduced-rank regression to be conveyed to a wide range of data types, including categorical data.

Modelling data from inside the Earth: local smoothing of mean and dispersion structure in deep drill data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082X3st048oa,MAR 2003,23,1,"The paper describes the analysis of data originating from the German Deep Drill Program. The amount of 'cataclastic rocks' is modelled with data resulting from a series of measurements taken from deep drill samples ranging from 1000 up to 5000 m depth. The measurements thereby describe the amount of strongly deformed rock particles and serve as indicator for the occurrence of cataclastic shear zones, which are areas of severely 'ground' stones due to movements of different layers in the earth crust. The data represent a 'depth series' as analogue to a 'time series', with mean, dispersion and correlation structure varying in depth. The general smooth structure is thereby disturbed by peaks and outliers so that robust procedures have to be applied for estimation. In terms of statistical modelling technology three different peculiarities of the data have to be tackled simultaneously, that is estimation of the correlation structure, local bandwidth selection and robust smoothing. To do so, existing routines are adapted and combined in new 'two-stage' estimation procedures.","local bandwidth,local smoothing,robust smoothing,smoothing correlated data","KERNEL REGRESSION ESTIMATION,BANDWIDTH SELECTION,SHEAR-ZONES,ERRORS","Kauermann, G@Univ Bielefeld, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany@Univ Munich, Munich, Germany::Kuchenhoff, H@Univ Bielefeld, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany@Univ Munich, Munich, Germany","Kauermann, G@University of Bielefeld@University of Munich::Kuchenhoff, H@University of Bielefeld@University of Munich","Kuchenhoff, Helmut@A-8291-2010::Kuchenhoff, Helmut@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6372-2487","no title+ALTMAN N+J STAT+2000::KERNEL SMOOTHING OF DATA WITH CORRELATED ERRORS+ALTMAN, NS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1990::BANDWIDTH SELECTION FOR KERNEL ESTIMATE WITH CORRELATED NOISE+CHIU, ST+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+SEP 1989::Edge-preserving smoothers for image processing+Chu, CK; Glad, IK; Godtliebsen, F; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1998::no title+DIGGLE O+ANAL LONGITUDINAL DA+1994::no title+DIGGLE O+APPL STAT+1998::The German Continental Deep Drilling Program KTB: Overview and major results+Emmermann, R; Lauterjung, J+JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH+AUG 10 1997::DATA-DRIVEN BANDWIDTH SELECTION IN LOCAL POLYNOMIAL FITTING - VARIABLE BANDWIDTH AND SPATIAL ADAPTATION+FAN, JQ; GIJBELS, I+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::no title+Gijbels, I.; Fan, J.+Local polynomial modeling and its applications.+1996::KERNEL REGRESSION ESTIMATION WITH TIME-SERIES ERRORS+HART, JD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::no title+Hastie, T.

Consequently, the mean and covariance function of the SMAs can be written down immediately in terms of their integrand or summand. Moreover, simulation from them is straightforward, and it does not require any large-matrix inversions. Although the SMAs generate a large class of spatial covariance functions, can we find easy-to-use SMAs, calibrated to be 'like' some of the usual covariance functions used in geostatistics? For example, is there an SMA that is straightforward to simulate from, whose covariance function is like the spherical covariance function? This article will derive such an SMA.","geostatistics,spatial covariance function,spatial statistics,spherical model",,"Cressie, Noel@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Pavlicova, Martina@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Cressie, Noel@Ohio State University::Pavlicova, Martina@Ohio State University",not exist,"Blackbox kriging: spatial prediction without specifying variogram models.+Barry, R.

Interpolation of nonstationary air pollution processes: a spatial spectral approach,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st034oa,DEC 2002,27,9,"Spatial processes are important models for many environmental problems. Classical geostatistics and Fourier spectral methods are powerful tools for stuyding the spatial structure of stationary processes. However, it is widely recognized that in real applications spatial processes are rarely stationary and isotropic. Consequently, it is important to extend these spectral methods to processes that are non-stationary. In this work, we present some new spectral approaches and tools to estimate the spatial structure of a nonstationary process. More specifically, we propose an approach for the spectral analysis of nonstationary spatial processes that is based on the concept of spatial spectra, i.e., spectral functions that are space-dependent. This notion of spatial spectra generalizes the definition of spectra for stationary processes, and under certain conditions, the spatial spectrum at each Location can be estimated from a single realization of the spatial process.

A kernel-based spectral model for non-Gaussian spatio-temporal processes,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st036oa,DEC 2002,26,48,"Spatio-temporal processes can often be written as hierarchical state-space processes. In situations with complicated dynamics such as wave propagation, it is difficult to parameterize state transition functions for high-dimensional state processes. Although in some cases prior understanding of the physical process can be used to formulate models for the state transition, this is not always possible. Alternatively, for processes where one considers discrete time and continuous space, complicated dynamics can be modeled by stochastic integro-difference equations in which the associated redistribution kernel is allowed to vary with space and/or time. By considering a spectral implementation of such models, one can formulate a spatio-temporal model with relatively few parameters that can accommodate complicated dynamics. This approach can be developed in a hierarchical framework for non-Gaussian processes, as demonstrated on cloud intensity data.","Bayesian,dilation,dynamic models,hierarchical,integro-difference equations,translation",,"Wikle, Christopher K.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Wikle, Christopher K.@University of Missouri System@University of Missouri Columbia",not exist,"no title+BENNETT, R.

Multiresolution models for nonstationary spatial covariance functions,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st037oa,DEC 2002,14,86,"Many geophysical and environmental problems depend on estimating a spatial process that has nonstationary structure. A nonstationary model is proposed based on the spatial field being a linear combination of multiresolution (wavelet) basis functions and random coefficients. The key is to allow for a limited number of correlations among coefficients and also to use a wavelet basis that is smooth. When approximately 6% nonzero correlations are enforced, this representation gives a good approximation to a family of Matern covariance functions. This sparseness is important not only for model parsimony but also has implications for the efficient analysis of large spatial data sets. The covariance model is successfully applied to ozone model output and results in a nonstationary but smooth estimate.","wavelet,Kriging,multiresolution,ozone pollution",,"Nychka, Douglas@Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Geophys Stat Project, Boulder, CO 80307 USA::Wikle, Christopher@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::Royle, J.

Generalized estimating equations: A hybrid approach for mean parameters in multivariate regression models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st031oa,OCT 2002,21,5,"We propose an extension of the generalized estimating equation approach to multivariate regression models (Liang and Zeger, 1986) which allows the estimation of dispersion and association parameters in the covariance matrix partly using estimating equations as in Prentice and Zhao (1991), and partly by the direct use of consistent estimators. The advantages of this hybrid approach over that of Prentice and Zhao (1991) are a reduction in the number of fourth moment assumptions that must be made, and the consequent reduction in numerical complexity. We show that the type of estimation used for covariance parameters does not affect the asymptotic efficiency of the mean parameter estimates. The advantages of the hybrid model are illustrated by a simulation study. This work was motivated by problems in statistical genetics, and we illustrate our approach using a twin study examining association between the osteocalcin receptor and various osteoporisis-related traits.","GEE,GEE2,association mapping",,"Lange, Christoph@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Whittaker, John C.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, London, England::Macgregor, Alex J.@St Thomas Hosp, Twin Res & Genet Epidemiol Unit, London, England","Lange, Christoph@Harvard University::Whittaker, John C.@Imperial College London::Macgregor, Alex J.@Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust","Whittaker, John@B-8609-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3529-2379::MacGregor, Alex@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2163-2325","Linkage and association for bone mineral density and heel ultrasound measurements with a simple tandem repeat polymorphism near the osteocalcin gene in female dizygotic twins+Andrew, T; Mak, YT; Reed, P; et al.+OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL+2002::no title+BALDING DJ+HDB STAT GENETICS+2001::no title+Brockwell, P.

Bayesian spatial models for small area estimation of proportions,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st032oa,OCT 2002,25,9,"This article presents a logistic hierarchical model approach for small area prediction of proportions, taking into account both possible spatial and unstructured heterogeneity effects. The posterior distributions of the proportion predictors are obtained via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. This automatically takes into account the extra uncertainty associated with the hyperparameters. The procedures are applied to a real data set and comparisons are made under several settings, including a quite general logistic hierarchical model with spatial structure plus unstructured heterogeneity for small area effects. A model selection criterion based on the Expected Prediction Deviance is proposed. Its utility for selecting among competitive models in the small area prediction context is examined.","small area estimation,spatial hierarchical models,model selection,MCMC,finite population model",,"Moura, F.

Assessing uncertainty about parameter estimates with incomplete repeated ordinal data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st033oa,OCT 2002,21,3,"Data collected in clinical trials involving follow-up of patients over a period of time will almost inevitably be incomplete. Patients will fail to turn up at some of the intended measurement times or will not complete the study, giving rise to various patterns of missingness. In these circumstances, the validity of the conclusions drawn from an analysis of available cases depends crucially on the mechanism driving the missing data process; this in turn cannot be known for certain. For incomplete categorical data, various authors have recently proposed taking into account in a systematic way the ignorance caused by incomplete data. In particular, the idea of intervals of ignorance has been introduced, whereby point estimates for parameters of interest are replaced by intervals or regions of ignorance (Vansteelandt and Goetghebeur, 2001; Kenward et al., 2001; Molenberghs et al., 2001). These are identified by the set of estimates corresponding to possible outcomes for the missing data under little or no assumptions about the missing data mechanism. Here we extend this idea to incomplete repeated ordinal data. We describe a modified version of standard algorithms used for fitting marginal models to longitudinal categorical data, which enables calculation of intervals of ignorance for the parameters of interest. The ideas are illustrated using dental pain measurements from a longitudinal clinical trial.","generalized estimating equations,intervals of ignorance and uncertainty,longitudinal ordinal data,missing data",,"Verzilli, Claudio J.@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Med Stat Unit, London WC1E 7HT, England::Carpenter, James R.@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Med Stat Unit, London WC1E 7HT, England","Verzilli, Claudio J.@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine::Carpenter, James R.@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","Carpenter, James@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3890-6206","no title+Bazaraa, M.

Size distribution of geological faults: Model choice and parameter estimation,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st039oa,OCT 2002,24,2,"Geological faults are important in reservoir characterization, since they influence fluid flow in the reservoir. Both the number of faults, or the fault intensity, and the fault sizes are of importance. Fault sizes are often represented by maximum displacements, which can be interpreted from seismic data. Owing to limitations in seismic resolution only faults of relatively large size can be observed, and the observations are biased. In order to make inference about the overall fault population, a proper model must be chosen for the fault size distribution. A fractal (Pareto) distribution is commonly used in geophysics literature, but the exponential distribution has also been suggested. In this work we compare the two models statistically. A Bayesian model is defined for the fault size distributions under the two competing models, where the prior distributions are given as the Pareto and the exponential pdfs, respectively, and the likelihood function describes the sampling errors associated with seismic fault observations. The Bayes factor is used as criterion for the model choice, and is estimated using MCMC sampling. The MCMC algorithm is constructed using pseudopriors to sample jointly the two models. The statistical procedure is applied to a fault size data set from the Gullfaks Field in the North Sea. For this data set we find that the fault sizes are best described by the exponential distribution.","Bayes factor,geological faults,MCMC sampling,pseudoprior",,"Borgos, Hilde Grude@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway::Omre, Henning@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway::Townsend, Chris@Statoil R&D Ctr, Trondheim, Norway","Borgos, Hilde Grude@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)::Omre, Henning@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)::Townsend, Chris@Statoil",not exist,"DISPLACEMENT GEOMETRY IN THE VOLUME CONTAINING A SINGLE NORMAL-FAULT+BARNETT, JAM; MORTIMER, J; RIPPON, JH; et al.+AAPG BULLETIN-AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS+AUG 1987::no title+Borgos, HG.+Stochastic modeling and statistical inference of geological fault populations and patterns+2000::BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE VIA MARKOV-CHAIN MONTE-CARLO METHODS+CARLIN, BP; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::QUANTITATIVE FAULT STUDIES ON THE EAST PACIFIC RISE - A COMPARISON OF SONAR IMAGING TECHNIQUES+COWIE, PA; MALINVERNO, A; RYAN, WBF; et al.+JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH+AUG 10 1994::GROWTH OF NORMAL FAULTS - DISPLACEMENT-LENGTH SCALING+DAWERS, NH; ANDERS, MH; SCHOLZ, CH+GEOLOGY+DEC 1993::The influence of seismic noise in structural interpretation of seismic attribute maps+Fossen, H; Hesthammer, J.+First Break+1997::Properties of fault populations in the Gullfaks field, northern North Sea+Fossen, H; Rornes, A+JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY+FEB-MAR 1996::Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo computation and Bayesian model determination+Green, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for computing Bayes factors: A comparative review+Han, C; Carlin, BP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::MONTE-CARLO SAMPLING METHODS USING MARKOV CHAINS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+HASTINGS, WK+BIOMETRIKA+1970::no title+Hatcher, R.

Semiparametric Bayesian models for human brain mapping,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st040oa,OCT 2002,28,6,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has led to enormous progress in human brain mapping. Adequate analysis of the massive spatiotemporal data sets generated by this imaging technique, combining parametric and non-parametric components, imposes challenging problems in statistical modelling. Complex hierarchical Bayesian models in combination with computer-intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo inference are promising tools.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it provides a review of general semiparametric Bayesian models for the analysis of fMRI data. Most approaches focus on important but separate temporal or spatial aspects of the overall problem, or they proceed by stepwise procedures. Therefore, as a second aim, we suggest a complete spatiotemporal model for analysing fMRI data within a unified semiparametric Bayesian framework. An application to data from a visual stimulation experiment illustrates our approach and demonstrates its computational feasibility.","functional magnetic resonance imaging,human brain mapping,MCMC,semiparametric models,spatiotemporal models",,"Fahrmeir, L.@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Goessl, C.@Max Planck Inst Psychiat, D-80804 Munich, Germany","Fahrmeir, L.@University of Munich::Goessl, C.@Max Planck Society",not exist,"The variability of human, BOLD hemodynamic responses+Aguirre, GK; Zarahn, E; D'Esposito, M+NEUROIMAGE+NOV 1998::Bayesian estimation for homogeneous and inhomogeneous Gaussian random fields+Aykroyd.+IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence+1998::PROCESSING STRATEGIES FOR TIME-COURSE DATA SETS IN FUNCTIONAL MRI OF THE HUMAN BRAIN+BANDETTINI, PA; JESMANOWICZ, A; WONG, EC; et al.+MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE+AUG 1993::In vivo fiber tractography using DT-MRI data+Basser, PJ; Pajevic, S; Pierpaoli, C; et al.+MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE+OCT 2000::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S.+Journal of Computional and Graphical Statistics+2002::Statistical methods of estimation and inference for functional MR image analysis+Bullmore, E; Brammer, M; Williams, SCR; et al.+MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE+FEB 1996::Parametric analysis of fMRI data using linear systems methods+Cohen, MS+NEUROIMAGE+AUG 1997::no title+Crellin, N; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I.+Statistical methods for image sequences+1998::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Mixture model mapping of brain activation in functional magnetic resonance images+Everitt, BS; Bullmore, ET+HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING+1999::Robust spatial smoothing in functional MRI+Fahrmeir, L; Gossl, C; Hennerfeind, A.+Exploratory Data Analysis in Empirical Research+2002::IMPROVED ASSESSMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACTIVATION IN FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-IMAGING (FMRI) - USE OF A CLUSTER-SIZE THRESHOLD+FORMAN, SD; COHEN, JD; FITZGERALD, M; et al.+MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE+MAY 1995::Analysis of functional MRI time-series+Friston, K.

Specification issues in stratified variance component ordinal response models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st041oa,OCT 2002,5,2,"The paper presents some criteria for the specification of ordinal variance component models when the units are grouped in a limited number of strata. The base model is specified using a latent variable approach, allowing the first level variance, the second level variance, and the thresholds to vary according to the strata. However this model is not identifiable. The paper discusses some alternative assumptions that overcome the identification problem and illustrates a general strategy for model selection. The proposed methodology is applied to the analysis of course programme evaluations based on student ratings, referring to three different schools of the University of Florence. The adopted model takes into account both the ordinal scale of the ratings and the hierarchical nature of the phenomenon. In this framework, the specification of the latent variable distributions is crucial, since a different first level variance among the schools would substantially change the interpretation of model parameters, as confirmed by the limited simulation study presented in the paper.","ordinal response models,variance component models,varying thresholds,course programme evaluation",,"Grilli, Leonardo@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, I-50134 Florence, Italy::Rampichini, Carla@Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, I-50134 Florence, Italy","Grilli, Leonardo@University of Florence::Rampichini, Carla@University of Florence","Grilli, Leonardo@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3886-7705","Students can help improve college teaching: a review and an agenda for the statistics profession+Emerson, JD; Mosteller, F; Youtz, C.+Statistics for the 21st Century: Methodologies for Applications of the Future+2000::Why use arbitrary points scores?: ordered categories in models of educational progress+Fielding, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1999::no title+Godfrey, LG.+Misspecification tests in econometrics+1991::A RANDOM-EFFECTS ORDINAL REGRESSION-MODEL FOR MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS+HEDEKER, D; GIBBONS, RD+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1994::no title+no author+SAS/STAT&amp;REG; User's Guide: version 8. 1+1999"
Genetic analysis of cause of death in a mixture model of bivariate lifetime data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st030oa,JUL 2002,18,11,"A mixture model in multivariate survival analysis is presented, whereby heterogeneity among subjects creates divergent paths for the individual's risk of experiencing an event (i.e., disease), as well as for the associated length of survival. Dependence among competing risks is included and rendered testable. This method is an extension of the bivariate correlated gamma-frailty model. It is applied to a data set on Danish twins, for whom cause-specific mortality is known. The use of multivariate data solves the identifiability problem which is inherent in the competing risk model of univariate lifetimes. We analyse the influence of genetic and environmental factors on frailty. Using a sample of 1470 monozygotic (MZ) and 2730 dizygotic (DZ) female twin pairs, we apply five genetic models to the associated mortality data, focusing particularly on death from coronary heart disease (CHD). Using the best fitting model, the inheritance risk of death from CHD was 0.39 (standard error 0.13). The results from this model are compared with the results from earlier analysis that used the restricted model, where the independence of competing risks was assumed. Comparing both cases, it turns out, that heritability of frailty on mortality due to CHD change substantially. Despite the inclusion of dependence, analysis confirms the significant genetic component to an individual's risk of mortality from CHD. Whether dependence or independence is assumed, the best model for analysis with regard to CHD mortality risks is a model assuming that additive factors are responsible for heritability in susceptibility to CHD. The paper ends with a discussion of limitations and possible further extensions to the model presented.","coronary heart disease,dependent competing risks,frailty,mixture models,survival analysis",,"Wienke, Andreas@Max Planck Inst Demog Res, D-18057 Rostock, Germany::Christensen, Kaare@Univ Southern Denmark, Danish Ctr Demog Res, Odense, Denmark@Univ Southern Denmark, Danish Twin Registry, Odense, Denmark::Skytthe, Axel@Univ Southern Denmark, Danish Ctr Demog Res, Odense, Denmark@Univ Southern Denmark, Danish Twin Registry, Odense, Denmark::Yashin, Anatoli I.@Max Planck Inst Demog Res, D-18057 Rostock, Germany","Wienke, Andreas@Max Planck Society::Christensen, Kaare@University of Southern Denmark::Skytthe, Axel@University of Southern Denmark::Yashin, Anatoli I.@Max Planck Society",not exist,"MORTALITY AMONG TWINS AFTER AGE-6 - FETAL ORIGINS HYPOTHESIS VERSUS TWIN METHOD+CHRISTENSEN, K; VAUPEL, JW; HOLM, NV; et al.+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+FEB 18 1995::Cardiovascular mortality in twins and the fetal origins hypothesis.+Christensen, K; Wienke, A; Skytthe, A; et al.+Twin research : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies+2001-Oct::MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZATIONS OF THE PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL+CLAYTON, D; CUZICK, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1985::The Danish Twin Register+Hauge, M.+Prospective longitudinal research+1981::TESTING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS FOR TWIN DATA USING LISREL+HEATH, AC; NEALE, MC; HEWITT, JK; et al.+BEHAVIOR GENETICS+JAN 1989::no title+Holm, NV.+The use of twin studies to investigate causes of diseases with complex etiology with a focus on cancer+1983::MEASURING THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE LIFETIMES OF ADULT DANISH TWINS BORN BETWEEN 1881-1930+HOUGAARD, P; HARVALD, B; HOLM, NV+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1992::Environment determines 50% of variability in individual frailty: results from Danish twin study+Iachine, IA; Yashin, AI.+Population Studies of Aging+1994::ESTIMATING GENETIC INFLUENCES ON THE AGE-AT-MENARCHE - A SURVIVAL ANALYSIS APPROACH+MEYER, JM; EAVES, LJ; HEATH, AC; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS+MAY 1 1991::no title+Neale, M.C; Cardon, L.R.+Methodology for Genetic Studies of Twins and Families+1992::ANALYZING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGE AT ONSET AND RISK TO RELATIVES+NEALE, MC; EAVES, LJ; HEWITT, JK; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS+AUG 1989::SURVIVAL MODELS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL GENETIC DATA - AGE-OF-ONSET OF PUBERTY AND ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR IN TWINS+PICKLES, A; CROUCHLEY, R; SIMONOFF, E; et al.+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+1994::NONIDENTIFIABILITY ASPECT OF PROBLEM OF COMPETING RISKS+TSIATIS, A+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+1975::INHERITED FRAILTY AND LONGEVITY+VAUPEL, JW+DEMOGRAPHY+MAY 1988::Heritability of death from respiratory diseases: an analysis of Danish twin survival data using a correlated frailty model+Wienke, A; Christensen, K; Holm, NV; et al.+MEDICAL INFOBAHN FOR EUROPE, PROCEEDINGS+2000::The heritability of mortality due to heart diseases: a correlated frailty model applied to Danish twins.+Wienke, A; Holm, N V; Skytthe, A; et al.+Twin research : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies+2001-Aug::The influence of smoking and BMI on heritability in susceptibility to coronary heart disease+Wienke, A; Herskind, AM; Christensen, K<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Skytthe, A; Yashin, AI</span>.+Working paper 2002-03+2002::GENETIC-ANALYSIS OF DURATIONS - CORRELATED FRAILTY MODEL APPLIED TO SURVIVAL OF DANISH TWINS+YASHIN, AI; IACHINE, IA+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+1995"
Improving financial risk assessment through dependency,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st028oa,JUL 2002,33,5,"Understanding dependency between financial markets is crucial when measuring globally integrated exposures to risk. To this end the first step may be the investigation of the joint behaviour of their most representative indexes. We fit by parametric and nonparametric methods bivariate extreme value models on the componentwise maxima and minima computed monthly from several pairs of indexes representing the North American, Latin American, and Emerging markets. We analyse the role of the asymmetric models, finding which market drives the dependency, and express the degrees of dependence using measures of linear and nonlinear dependency such as the linear correlation coefficient rho and the measure tau based on the dependence function. We discuss the interpretation of t as a conditional probability that a crash occurs in a market given that a catastrophic event has occurred in some other market. We assess risks by computing probabilities associated with joint extreme events and by computing joint risk measures. We show empirically that the joint Value-at-Risk may be severely under-estimated if independence is assumed between markets. To take into account the clustering of extreme events we compute the bivariate extremal index and incorporate this information in the analysis.","bivariate extreme value models,extremal index,risk measures",,"Mendes, Beatriz V.

Semiparametric modelling of spatial binary observations,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st023oa,JUL 2002,34,7,"In the past decade various attempts have been made to extend standard random effects models to the analysis of spatial observations. This extension is a source of theoretical difficulty due to the multidirectional dependence among nearest observations; much of the previous work was based on parametric assumptions about the random effects distribution. To avoid any restriction, we propose a conditional model for spatial binary responses, without assuming a parametric distribution for the random effects. The model parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm for nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation of a mixing distribution. To illustrate the proposed approach, the model is applied to a remote sensed image of the Nebrodi Mountains (Italy).","autologistic model,nonparametric maximum likelihood,random effects,spatial binary responses",,"Alfo, Marco@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Stat Probabil & Stat Appl, I-00185 Rome, Italy::Postiglione, Paolo@Univ G DAnnunzio, Dipartimento Sci, Chieti, Italy","Alfo, Marco@Sapienza University Rome::Postiglione, Paolo@G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara","POSTIGLIONE, PAOLO@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2798-4519","A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::A general maximum likelihood analysis of overdispersion in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+SEP 1996::Practical maximum pseudolikelihood for spatial point patterns+Baddeley, A; Turner, R+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2000::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF NON-LATTICE DATA+BESAG, J+STATISTICIAN+1975::Non-parametric maximum likelihood estimators for disease mapping+Biggeri, A; Marchi, M; Lagazio, C; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 15 2000::Computer-assisted analysis of mixtures and applications+Bohning, D.+Meta-analysis, disease mapping and others+1999::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF HETEROGENEOUS COUNT DATA MODELS+BRANNAS, K; ROSENQVIST, G+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+JUL 28 1994::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATES OF AGE-STANDARDIZED RELATIVE RISKS FOR USE IN DISEASE MAPPING+CLAYTON, D; KALDOR, J+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1987::Mapping rates associated with polygons+Cressie, N; Stern, HS; WrightReber, D.+EPA Reprints+1999::THE EVALUATION OF INTEGRALS OF THE FORM INTEGRAL-INFINITY+INFINITY F(T)EXP(-T2) DT - APPLICATION TO LOGISTIC NORMAL-MODELS+CROUCH, EAC; SPIEGELMAN, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::NONPARAMETRIC CONTROL FOR RESIDUAL HETEROGENEITY IN MODELING RECURRENT BEHAVIOR+DAVIES, RB+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 1993::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Using bootstrap likelihood ratios in finite mixture models+Feng, ZD; McCulloch, CE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::IDENTIFIABILITY OF FINITE MIXTURES OF LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS+FOLLMANN, DA; LAMBERT, D+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1991::Autologistic model of spatial pattern of <i>Phytophthora</i> epidemic in bell pepper: effects of soil variables on disease presence.+Gumpertz, M.

Stationary space-time Gaussian fields and their time autoregressive representation,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st029oa,JUL 2002,24,25,"We compare two different modelling strategies for continuous space discrete time data. The first strategy is in the spirit of Gaussian kriging. The model is a general stationary space-time Gaussian field where the key point is the choice of a parametric form for the covariance function. In the main, covariance functions that are used are separable in space and time. Nonseparable covariance functions are useful in many applications, but construction of these is not easy.

The second strategy is to model the time evolution of the process more directly. We consider models of the autoregressive type where the process at time t is obtained by convolving the process at time t - 1 and adding spatially correlated noise.

Under specific conditions, the two strategies describe two different formulations of the same stochastic process. We show how the two representations look in different cases. Furthermore, by transforming time-dynamic convolution models to Gaussian fields we can obtain new covariance functions and by writing a Gaussian field as a time-dynamic convolution model, interesting properties are discovered.

The computational aspects of the two strategies are discussed through experiments on a dataset of daily UK temperatures. Although algorithms for performing estimation, simulation, and so on are easy to do for the first strategy, more computer-efficient algorithms based on the second strategy can be constructed.","convolution models,Kalman filter,nonseparable,space-time covariance structure,spectral representation,stationary Gaussian fields",,"Storvik, Geir@Univ Oslo, Dept Math, N-0316 Oslo, Norway@Norwegian Comp Ctr, Oslo, Norway::Frigessi, Arnoldo@Univ Oslo, Dept Math, N-0316 Oslo, Norway@Norwegian Comp Ctr, Oslo, Norway::Hirst, David@Norwegian Comp Ctr, Oslo, Norway","Storvik, Geir@University of Oslo::Frigessi, Arnoldo@University of Oslo::Hirst, David@Unknow","Storvik, Geir Olve@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8198-1426","no title+Bouleau, N.; Lepingle, D.+Numerical methods for stochastic processes+1994::Blur-generated non-separable space-time models+Brown, PE; Karesen, KF; Roberts, GO; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::Ozone exposure and population density in Harris County, Texas+Carroll, RJ; Chen, R; George, EI; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::Classes of nonseparable, spatio-temporal stationary covariance functions+Cressie, N; Huang, HC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1999::no title+no author+Statistics for spatial data+1991::THE SIMULATION SMOOTHER FOR TIME-SERIES MODELS+DEJONG, P; SHEPHARD, N+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1995::Model-based geostatistics+Diggle, PJ; Tawn, JA; Moyeed, RA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1998::Bayesian variogram modeling for an isotropic spatial process.+Ecker, Mark D.; Gelfand, Alan E.+Journal of Agricultural Biological and Environmental Statistics+December 1997::Local prediction of a spatio-temporal process with an application to wet sulfate deposition+Haas, TC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Non-Stationary Spatial Modeling+Higdon, D.

Semiparametric methods in applied econometrics: do the models fit the data?,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st024oa,APR 2002,31,8,"Much empirical research in economics and other fields is concerned with estimating the mean of a random variable conditional on one or more explanatory variables (conditional mean function). The most frequently used estimation methods assume that the conditional mean function is known up to a finite number of parameters, but the resulting estimates can be highly misleading if the assumed parametric model is incorrect. This paper reviews several semiparametric methods for estimating conditional mean functions. These methods are more flexible than parametric methods and offer greater estimation precision than do fully nonparametric methods. The various estimation methods are illustrated by applying them to data on the salaries of professional baseball players in the USA. We find that a parametric model and several simple semiparametric models fail to capture important features of the data. However, a sufficiently rich semiparametric model fits the data well. We conclude that semiparametric models can achieve their aim of providing flexible representations of conditional mean functions, but care is needed in choosing the semiparametric specification. Our analysis also provides some suggestions for further research on semiparametric estimation.","additive model,dimension reduction,index model,nonparametric regression",,"Horowitz, Joel L.@Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA::Lee, Sokbae@Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Horowitz, Joel L.@Northwestern University::Lee, Sokbae@University of Iowa","Lee, Sokbae@F-7514-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4080-7733","Goodness-of-fit tests for kernel regression with an application to option implied volatilities+Ait Sahalia, Y; Bickel, PJ; Stoker, T.+Journal of Econometrics+2001::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATES OF THE RELATION BETWEEN WEATHER AND ELECTRICITY SALES+ENGLE, RF; GRANGER, CWJ; RICE, J; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1986::Direct estimation of low-dimensional components in additive models+Fan, JQ; Hardle, W; Mammen, E+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1998::Consistent model specification tests: Omitted variables and semiparametric functional forms+Fan, YQ; Li, Q+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1996::no title+Gijbels, I.; Fan, J.+Local polynomial modeling and its applications.+1996::no title+Goldberger, A.

Fitting exponential family mixed models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st025oa,APR 2002,39,0,"The generalized linear model (McCullagh and Nelder, 1972) and the semiparametric multiplicative hazard model (Cox, 1972) have significantly influenced the way in which statistical modelling is taught and practiced. Common for the two model families is the assumption that conditionally on covariate information (including time) the observations are independent. The obvious difficulty in identifying and measuring all relevant covariates has pushed for methods that can jointly handle both mean and dependence structures. The early 1990s saw a myriad of approaches for dealing with multivariate generalized linear models. More recently, the hazard models have been extended to multivariate settings. Here we review (i) penalized likelihood, (ii) Monte Carlo EM, and (iii) Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for fitting the generalized linear mixed models and the frailty models, and we discuss the rationale for choosing between the methods. The similarities of the toolboxes for these two multivariate model families open up for a new level of generality both in teaching and applied research. Two examples are used for illustration, involving censored failure time responses and Poisson responses, respectively.","frailty,generalized linear mixed model,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Monte Carlo EM,penalized likelihood,random effects",,"Palmgren, Juni@Stockholm Univ, Math Stat, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden@Karolinska Inst, Med Epidemiol, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden::Ripatti, Samuli@Stockholm Univ, Math Stat, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden@Univ Helsinki, Rolf Nevanlinna Inst, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Palmgren, Juni@Stockholm University@Karolinska Institutet::Ripatti, Samuli@University of Helsinki@Stockholm University","Ripatti, Samuli@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0504-1202","no title+Andersen, PK; Borgan, O; Gill, RD<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Keiding, N</span>.+Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes+1993::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::COVARIANCE ANALYSIS OF CENSORED SURVIVAL DATA+BRESLOW, N+BIOMETRICS+1974::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::EXTRA-POISSON VARIATION IN LOG-LINEAR MODELS+BRESLOW, NE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1984::Generalized linear mixed models+Clayton, D.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice+1996::Some approaches to the analysis of recurrent event data.+Clayton, D+Statistical methods in medical research+1994::A MONTE-CARLO METHOD FOR BAYESIAN-INFERENCE IN FRAILTY MODELS+CLAYTON, DG+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1991::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+Gelman, A.+Bayesian Data Analysis+1995::Inference from iterative simulation using multiple sequences+Gelman, A; Rubin, DB.+Stat Sci+1992::no title+Gilks, W.; Richardson, S.; Spiegelhalter, D.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice+1996::PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD FOR GENERAL SEMIPARAMETRIC REGRESSION-MODELS+GREEN, PJ+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1987::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD APPROACHES TO VARIANCE COMPONENT ESTIMATION AND TO RELATED PROBLEMS+HARVILLE, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::MODELING HETEROGENEITY IN SURVIVAL-DATA+HOUGAARD, P+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+SEP 1991::An extension of Cox&amp;rsquo;s regression model+Johansen, S.+International Statistical Review+1983::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF RANDOM EFFECTS USING THE COX MODEL BASED ON THE EM ALGORITHM+KLEIN, JP+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1992::RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS FOR LONGITUDINAL DATA+LAIRD, NM; WARE, JH+BIOMETRICS+1982::Bias correction in generalized linear mixed models with multiple components of dispersion+Lin, XH; Breslow, NE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1996::Finding observed information using the EM algorithm+Louis, T.

The common structure of several models for non-ignorable dropout,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st022oa,APR 2002,30,13,"This paper presents a multivariate generalization of the classical Heckman selection model and applies it to non-ignorable dropout in repeated continuous responses. Many of the recent models for dropout in repeated continuous responses can be written as special forms of this generalized Heckman model. To illustrate this, we present the parameterizations needed to obtain the form of dropout model that occurs when (1) the separate models for the response and dropout are linked by common random parameters, (2) the dropout model is an explicit function of the previous responses and the possibly unobserved current response, (3) the dropout model is both a function of the current response and a common random parameter, and (4) there is a covariance between the stochastic disturbances of the response and dropout processes. We present the joint likelihood of the generalized Heckman model and a residual for the responses. We contrast two of the dropout models in a simulation study. We compare the results obtained from several dropout models on the well known mastitis data.","continuous responses,ignorable dropout,latent variables,longitudinal data,mastitis,missing data,multivariate normal distribution,unstructured covariance matrix",,"Crouchley, Rob@Univ Lancaster, Fylde Coll, Ctr Appl Stat, Lancaster LA1 4YF, England::Ganjali, Mojtaba@Shahid Beheshti Univ, Coll Math Sci, Dept Stat, Tehran, Iran","Crouchley, Rob@Lancaster University::Ganjali, Mojtaba@Unknow","crouchley, robert@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6434-4051","ON 2 FAMILIES OF TRANSFORMATIONS TO ADDITIVITY FOR BINARY RESPONSE DATA+ARANDAORDAZ, FJ+BIOMETRIKA+1981::no title+Blalock, H.

A life table approach to small area health need profiling,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1191/1471082x02st026oa,APR 2002,41,3,"Recent developments in health outcome models for small areas have found benefits from pooling information over areas to produce smoothed estimates of mortality and morbidity rates. Such indices serve as proxies for the need for health care and are often used in allocating health care resources. The present paper adopts a full life table approach to such outcomes, which includes the joint modelling of mortality and health variation between small areas. A further feature of the approach here is random effects modelling of age-specific death and wellness rates, so pooling strength in estimating life table parameters for areas, such as healthy and total life expectancies, which may be based on small event counts. The basic model involves exchangeable random effects for age and area. However, structured forms of variation considered include correlations between mortality and health, spatial correlation in these outcomes, and interrelatedness in age effects. A case study illustration uses deaths and long-term illness data to develop small area life tables for two London boroughs, and includes a temporal perspective on deaths. It then considers the utility of area life table measures in predicting health activity, providing a form of validation in addition to formal statistical cross-validation.","health need,health resourcing,healthy life expectancy,life tables,long-term illness,spatial correlation",,"Congdon, Peter@Univ London, Dept Geog, London E1 4NS, England","Congdon, Peter@University of London",not exist,"MODEL MORTALITY PATTERNS - A PARAMETRIC EVALUATION+ANSON, J+POPULATION STUDIES-A JOURNAL OF DEMOGRAPHY+MAR 1991::Limiting long term illness and its associations with mortality and indicators of social deprivation+Bentham, G; Eimermann, J; Haynes, R; et al.+JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH+DEC 1995::THE DETERMINANTS OF HOSPITAL UTILIZATION - IMPLICATIONS FOR RESOURCE-ALLOCATION IN ENGLAND+BENZEVAL, M; JUDGE, K+HEALTH ECONOMICS+MAR-APR 1994::BAYESIAN IMAGE-RESTORATION, WITH 2 APPLICATIONS IN SPATIAL STATISTICS+BESAG, J; YORK, J; MOLLIE, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1991::Bayesian ecological modelling+Best, N+DISEASE MAPPING AND RISK ASSESSMENT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH+1999::no title+BEST NG+BAYESIAN STAT+1999::Bayesian spline-type smoothing in generalized regression models+Biller, C; Fahrmeir, L+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+1997::Health and ill-health in the older population in England and Wales+Brayne, C; Matthews, FE; McGee, MA; et al.+AGE AND AGEING+JAN 2001::no title+Carlin, B; Louis, T.+Bayes and empirical Bayes methods for data analysis+1996::A simple Monte Carlo approach to Bayesian graduation+Carlin, B.+Transactions of the Society of Actuaries+1992::A formula for distributing NHS revenues based on small area use of hospital beds+Carr-Hill, R; Hardman, G; Martin, S<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Peacock, S</span>.+Resource Allocation Working Papers and Research Papers 7+1994::A multi-level perspective on small-area health and mortality: a case study of England and Wales.+Congdon, P; Shouls, S; Curtis, S+International journal of population geography : IJPG+1997-Sep::STATISTICAL GRADUATION IN LOCAL DEMOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS AND PROJECTION+CONGDON, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1993::Small area variation in hospital admission rates: Bayesian adjustment for primary care and hospital factors+Congdon, P; Best, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2000::CHANGES IN LIFE EXPECTANCY AND DISABILITY-FREE LIFE EXPECTANCY IN THE UNITED-STATES+CRIMMINS, EM; SAITO, Y; INGEGNERI, D+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+JUN 1989::PROTECTION AGAINST OUTLIERS IN EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATION+FARRELL, PJ; MACGIBBON, B; TOMBERLIN, TJ+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 1994::SAMPLING-BASED APPROACHES TO CALCULATING MARGINAL DENSITIES+GELFAND, AE; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::ACTIVE LIFE EXPECTANCY+KATZ, S; BRANCH, LG; BRANSON, MH; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+1983::no title+Kitagawa, G; Gersch, W.+SMOOTHNESS PRIORS AN+1996::Bayesian detection of clusters and discontinuities in disease maps+Knorr-Held, L; Rasser, G+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2000::Multivariate spatial models for event data+Leyland, AH; Langford, IH; Rasbash, J; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 15 2000::STATISTICALLY ADJUSTED ESTIMATES OF GEOGRAPHIC MORTALITY PROFILES+MANTON, KG; STALLARD, E; WOODBURY, MA; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE+MAY 1987::How good is Sullivan's method for monitoring changes in population health expectancies+Mathers, CD; Robine, JM+JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH+FEB 1997::Notes on Bayesian graduation+Miller, R; Hickman, J.+Transactions of the Society of Actuaries+1977::Bayesian mapping of disease+Mollie, A.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in practice+1996::Bayesian areal interpolation, estimation, and smoothing: an inferential approach for geographic information systems+Mugglin, AS; Carlin, BP; Zhu, L; et al.+ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A+AUG 1999::no title+Murray, CJL; Lopez, AD.+The Global Burden of Disease+1996::Bayesian analysis of mortality rates for US health service areas+Nandram, B; Sedransk, J; Pickle, L.+Sankhya+1999::Suppressing random walks in Markov chain Monte Carlo using ordered overrelaxation+Neal, RM+LEARNING IN GRAPHICAL MODELS+1998::Allocating resources in health care: alternative approaches to measuring needs in resource allocation formula in Ontario+Newbold, K.

A bivariate INAR(1) process with application,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100403,AUG 2011,25,33,"The study of time series models for count data has become a topic of special interest during the last years. However, while research on univariate time series for counts now flourishes, the literature on multivariate time series models for count data is notably more limited. In the present paper, a bivariate integer-valued autoregressive process of order 1 (BINAR(1)) is introduced. Emphasis is placed on models with bivariate Poisson and bivariate negative binomial innovations. We discuss properties of the BINAR(1) model and propose the method of conditional maximum likelihood for the estimation of its unknown parameters. Issues of diagnostics and forecasting are considered and predictions are produced by means of the conditional forecast distribution. Estimation uncertainty is accommodated by taking advantage of the asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators and constructing appropriate confidence intervals for the h-step-ahead conditional probability mass function. The proposed model is applied to a bivariate data series concerning daytime and nighttime road accidents in the Netherlands.","BINAR,bivariate time series,count data,negative binomial,Poisson","VARIATE TIME-SERIES,COUNT DATA,DISCRETE,MODELS","Pedeli, Xanthi@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens 10434, Greece::Karlis, Dimitris@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens 10434, Greece","Pedeli, Xanthi@Athens University of Economics & Business::Karlis, Dimitris@Athens University of Economics & Business","Pedeli, Xanthi@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2627-2990::Karlis, Dimitris@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3711-1575","The multivariate Poisson-log normal distribution+Aitchinson, J.; Ho, C.H.+Biometrika+1989::First order integer valued autoregressive (INAR(l)) process+Al-Osh, M.

Random covariances and mixed-effects models for imputing multivariate multilevel continuous data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100404,AUG 2011,34,14,"Principled techniques for incomplete data problems are increasingly part of mainstream statistical practice. Among many proposed techniques so far, inference by multiple imputation (MI) has emerged as one of the most popular. While many strategies leading to inference by MI are available in cross-sectional settings, the same richness does not exist in multilevel applications. The limited methods available for multilevel applications rely on the multivariate adaptations of mixed-effects models. This approach preserves the mean structure across clusters and incorporates distinct variance components into the imputation process. In this paper, I add to these methods by considering a random covariance structure and develop computational algorithms. The attraction of this new imputation modelling strategy is to correctly reflect the mean and variance structure of the joint distribution of the data and allow the covariances differ across the clusters. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, a predictive distribution of missing data given observed data is simulated leading to creation of MIs. To circumvent the large sample size requirement to support independent covariance estimates for the level-1 error term, I consider distributional impositions mimicking random-effects distributions assigned a priori. These techniques are illustrated in an example exploring relationships between victimization and individual and contextual level factors that raise the risk of violent crime.","complex sample surveys,linear mixed-effects models,missing data,mixed effects,multiple imputation,random covariances","MULTIPLE-IMPUTATION,MISSING DATA,SIMULATION","Yucel, Recai M.@SUNY Albany, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Rensselaer, NY 12144 USA","Yucel, Recai M.@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Albany",not exist,"no title+DANIELS M+J MULTIVARIATE ANAL+2006::no title+Demidenko, E.+Mixed models: theory and applications+2004::Plausibility of multivariate normality assumption when multiply imputing non-Gaussian continuous outcomes: a simulation assessment+Demirtas, Hakan; Freels, Sally A.; Yucel, Recai M.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2008::An imputation strategy for incomplete longitudinal ordinal data+Demirtas, Hakan; Hedeker, Donald+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 10 2008::no title+Diggle, PJ; Liang, K-Y; Zeger, S.+Analysis of Longitudinal Data+1994::no title+Fitzmaurice, G.M.; Laird, N.M.; Ware, J.H.+Applied Longitudinal Analysis+2004::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

Transformed symmetric models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100405,AUG 2011,16,3,"For the first time, we introduce a class of transformed symmetric models to extend the Box and Cox models to more general symmetric models. The new class of models includes all symmetric continuous distributions with a possible non-linear structure for the mean and enables the fitting of a wide range of models to several data types. The proposed methods offer more flexible alternatives to Box-Cox or other existing procedures. We derive a very simple iterative process for fitting these models by maximum likelihood, whereas a direct unconditional maximization would be more difficult. We give simple formulae to estimate the parameter that indexes the transformation of the response variable and the moments of the original dependent variable which generalize previous published results. We discuss inference on the model parameters. The usefulness of the new class of models is illustrated in one application to a real dataset.","Box-Cox model,dispersion parameter,generalized linear model,maximum likelihood,symmetric distribution,transformation parameter","DISTRIBUTIONS,SERIES","Cordeiro, Gauss M.@Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Estat & Informat, Recife, PE, Brazil::Andrade, Marinho G.@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Matemat Aplicada & Estat, Inst Ciencias Matemat & Computacao, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Cordeiro, Gauss M.@Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE)::Andrade, Marinho G.@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Cordeiro, Gauss@J-7210-2012::Inst Cien Matematicas Computacao, ICMC/USP@D-8320-2017::Andrade, Marinho@F-2245-2011","EDGEWORTH AND SADDLE-POINT APPROXIMATIONS WITH STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1979::AN ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, GEP; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1964::ON THE THEORY OF ELLIPTICALLY CONTOURED DISTRIBUTIONS+CAMBANIS, S; HUANG, S; SIMONS, G+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+1981::ELLIPTICALLY SYMMETRIC DISTRIBUTIONS - A REVIEW AND BIBLIOGRAPHY+CHMIELEWSKI, MA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1981::BIAS CORRECTION IN ARMA MODELS+CORDEIRO, GM; KLEIN, R+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 22 1994::Restricted methods in symmetrical linear regression models+Cysneiros, FJA; Paula, GA+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 1 2005::ON DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR TRANSFORMATION TO NORMALITY+DRAPER, NR; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1969::TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS SUPPORTED BY POWER-TRANSFORMATIONS+GUERRERO, VM+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JAN 1993::ROBUST STATISTICAL MODELING USING THE T-DISTRIBUTION+LANGE, KL; LITTLE, RJA; TAYLOR, JMG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1989::EXPONENTIAL DATA TRANSFORMATIONS+MANLY, BFJ+STATISTICIAN+1976::AN EXTENDED QUASI-LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION+NELDER, JA; PREGIBON, D+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1987::FORECASTS OF POWER-TRANSFORMED SERIES+PANKRATZ, A; DUDLEY, U+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+OCT-DEC 1987::no title+Ramanathan, R.+STAT METHODS ECONOME+1993::no title+SAKIA RM+STATISTICIAN+1992::THE RETRANSFORMED MEAN AFTER A FITTED POWER TRANSFORMATION+TAYLOR, JMG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1986::An explicit variance formula for the Box-Cox functional form estimator+Yang, ZL; Abeysinghe, T+ECONOMICS LETTERS+JUL 2002"
Variable selection in additive models by non-negative garrote,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100304,JUN 2011,31,12,"We adapt Breiman's non-negative garrote method to perform variable selection in non-parametric additive models. The technique avoids methods of testing for which no general reliable distributional theory is available. In addition, it removes the need for a full search of all possible models, something which is computationally intensive, especially when the number of variables is moderate to high. The method has the advantages of being conceptually simple and computationally fast. It provides accurate predictions and is effective at identifying the variables generating the model. To illustrate our procedure, we analyse logbook data on blue sharks (Prionace glauca) from the US pelagic longline fishery. In addition, we compare our proposal to a series of available alternatives by simulation. The results show that in all cases our methods perform better or as well as these alternatives.","Blue shark logbook data,cross-validation,non-negative garrote,non-parametric regression,shrinkage methods,variable selection","NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,SMOOTHING PARAMETER,SPLINES,LASSO","Cantoni, Eva@Univ Geneva, Dept Econ, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland@Univ Geneva, Inst Stat, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland::Flemming, Joanna Mills@Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada::Ronchetti, Elvezio@Univ Geneva, Dept Econ, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland@Univ Geneva, Inst Stat, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Cantoni, Eva@University of Geneva::Flemming, Joanna Mills@Dalhousie University::Ronchetti, Elvezio@University of Geneva",not exist,"Parsimonious additive models+Avalos, Marta; Grandvalet, Yves; Ambroise, Christophe+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 1 2007::no title+BAUM J+THESIS DALHOUSIE U H+2007::Collapse and conservation of shark populations in the Northwest Atlantic+Baum, JK; Myers, RA; Kehler, DG; et al.+SCIENCE+JAN 17 2003::no title+BOCK M+991 U GLASG DEP STAT+1999::BETTER SUBSET REGRESSION USING THE NONNEGATIVE GARROTE+BREIMAN, L+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1995::Variable selection and function estimation in additive nonparametric regression using a data-based prior - Comment+Brumback, BA; Ruppert, D; Wand, MP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1999::Boosting with the L-2 loss: Regression and classification+Buhlmann, P; Yu, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2003::no title+CANTONI E+200605 U GEN DEP EC+2006::Variable selection for marginal longitudinal generalized linear models+Cantoni, E; Flemming, JM; Ronchetti, E+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2005::Degrees-of-freedom tests for smoothing splines+Cantoni, E; Hastie, T+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2002::Resistant selection of the smoothing parameter for smoothing splines+Cantoni, E; Ronchetti, E+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+APR 2001::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::REGRESSIONS BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS+FURNIVAL, GM; WILSON, RW+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::no title+Hardle, W.+Applied Nonparametric Regression+1990::no title+Hastie, T.; Tibshirani, R.; Friedman, J.+The Elements of Statistical Learning+2001::no title+HASTIE TJ+GENERALIZED ADDITIVE+1990::no title+Lawson, C.L.; Hanson, R.J.+Solving Least Squares Problems+1974::Component selection and smoothing in multivariate nonparametric regression+Lin, Yi; Zhang, Hao Helen+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2006::Cascading effects of the loss of apex predatory sharks from a coastal ocean+Myers, Ransom A.; Baum, Julia K.; Shepherd, Travis D.; et al.+SCIENCE+MAR 30 2007::A fully automated bandwidth selection method for fitting additive models+Opsomer, JD; Ruppert, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1998::AMlet, RAMlet, and GAMlet: Automatic nonlinear fitting of additive models, robust and generalized, with wavelets+Sardy, S; Tseng, P+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2004::LINEAR-MODEL SELECTION BY CROSS-VALIDATION+SHAO, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::Regression shrinkage and selection via the Lasso+Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Generalized additive modeling with implicit variable selection by likelihood-based boosting+Tutz, Gerhard; Binder, Harald+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2006::no title+Wood, S.

A Bayesian regression model for circular data based on the projected normal distribution,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100301,JUN 2011,24,10,Inferences based on regression models for a directional response are usually problematic. This paper presents a Bayesian analysis of a regression model for circular data using the projected normal distribution. Inferences about the model are based on samples from the posterior densities which are obtained using the Gibbs sampler after the introduction of suitable latent variables. The problem of missing data in the response variable is also addressed in this context as is the use of a predictive criterion for model selection. The procedures are illustrated using two simulated datasets a dataset previously analysed in the literature and a real dataset concerning wind directions.,"circular-linear regression,Gibbs sampler,latent variables,missing data,model selection","DIRECTIONAL-DATA,SELECTION","Nunez-Antonio, Gabriel@Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Dept Math, Iztapalapa, Mexico@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, E-28903 Getafe, Spain::Gutierrez-Pena, Eduardo@Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, IIMAS, Dept Probabil & Stat, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico::Escarela, Gabriel@Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Dept Math, Iztapalapa, Mexico","Nunez-Antonio, Gabriel@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid@Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico::Gutierrez-Pena, Eduardo@Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico::Escarela, Gabriel@Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico",not exist,"Recent advances in the analyses of directional data in ecological and environmental sciences+Arnold, Barry C.; SenGupta, Ashis+ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2006::Optimal predictive model selection+Barbieri, MM; Berger, JO+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::Circular regression+Downs, TD; Mardia, KV+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::no title+Fisher, N.

Modelling the dependence of goals scored by opposing teams in international soccer matches,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100303,JUN 2011,17,9,"This paper presents models for the number of goals scored by opposing teams in international soccer matches. The bivariate discrete distributions employed are defined in terms of the marginal distributions and a dependence copula. This copula representation allows dependence in the bivariate distribution to be modelled in a flexible manner by specifying a suitable family of copula functions and fitting this to the bivariate data using maximum likelihood. Marginal means are modelled with match covariates. The nature of the dependence in the number of goals scored is complex, and we develop the idea that the strength of dependence depends on the competitive balance of a match. Our analysis suggests that for games between closely matched teams, the overall dependence is low, and that the dependence becomes increasingly negative as the competitiveness of a match decreases. In this way, we relate dependence to competitive balance and suggest a method to measure the latter quantity. The models developed here may also offer better forecasts than those offered by match outcome models with independent marginal distributions.","competitive balance,copula,football,negative binomial",ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL,"McHale, Ian@Univ Salford, Salford Business Sch, Ctr Operat Res & Appl Stat, Manchester M5 4WT, Lancs, England@Univ Salford, Ctr Study Gambling, Manchester M5 4WT, Lancs, England::Scarf, Phil@Univ Salford, Ctr Study Gambling, Manchester M5 4WT, Lancs, England","McHale, Ian@University of Salford::Scarf, Phil@University of Salford",not exist,"Modelling association football scores and inefficiencies in the football betting market+Dixon, MJ; Coles, SG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1997::Forecasting sport: the behaviour and performance of football tipsters+Forrest, D; Simmons, R+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JUL-SEP 2000::A primer on copulas for count data+Genest, Christian; Neslehova, Johanna+ASTIN BULLETIN+NOV 2007::Everything you always wanted to know about copula modeling but were afraid to ask+Genest, Christian; Favre, Anne-Catherine+JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING+JUL-AUG 2007::Regression models for forecasting goals and match results in association football+Goddard, J+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+APR-JUN 2005::Forecasting football results and the efficiency of fixed-odds betting+Goddard, J; Asimakopoulos, I+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JAN 2004::no title+Joe, H.+Multivariate Models and Dependence Concepts+1997::Analysis of sports data by using bivariate Poisson models+Karlis, D; Ntzoufras, L+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+2003::Balance in competition in Dutch soccer+Koning, RH+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+2000::Modelling association football scores+Maher, M.+Statistica Neerlandica+1982::Modelling soccer matches using bivariate discrete distributions with general dependence structure+McHale, Ian; Scarf, Phil+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+NOV 2007::no title+MORONEY MJ+FACTS FROM FIGURES+1956::no title+Nelsen, R.

We establish flexible analytical tools for multivariate skew t models when fat-tailed, asymmetric and missing observations simultaneously occur in the input data. For the ease of computation and theoretical developments, two auxiliary indicator matrices are incorporated into the model for the determination of observed and missing components of each observation that can effectively reduce the computational complexity. Under the missing at random assumption, we present a Monte Carlo version of the expectation conditional maximization algorithm, which is performed to estimate the parameters and retrieve each missing observation with a single value. Additionally, a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampler with data augmentation is developed to account for the uncertainty of parameters as well as missing outcomes. The methodology is illustrated through two real data sets.","data augmentation,MCECM algorithm,missing at random,MST model,multiple imputation,multivariate truncated t distribution","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,EM ALGORITHM,MISSING DATA,DATA AUGMENTATION,ML-ESTIMATION,INFERENCE,COMPONENTS,IMPUTATION,REGRESSION,ECM","Lin, Tsung-I@Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Math, Taichung 40227, Taiwan@Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Inst Stat, Taichung 40227, Taiwan::Lin, Tzy-Chy@Ctr Drug Evaluat, Div Clin Sci, Taipei, Taiwan","Lin, Tsung-I@National Chung Hsing University::Lin, Tzy-Chy@Unknow","Lin, Tsung-I@Q-3423-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3992-1128","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES FOR A MULTIVARIATE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION WHEN SOME OBSERVATIONS ARE MISSING+ANDERSON, TW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1957::Distributions generated by perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on a multivariate skew t-distribution+Azzalini, A;

Exploiting blank spots for model-based background correction in discovering genes with DNA array data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100201,APR 2011,45,1,"Motivated by a real data set deriving from a study on the genetic determinants of the behavior of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) hosted in macrophage, we take advantage of the presence of control spots and illustrate modelling issues for background correction and the ensuing empirical findings resulting from a Bayesian hierarchical approach to the problem of detecting differentially expressed genes.

We prove the usefulness of a fully integrated approach where background correction and normalization are embedded in a single model-based framework, creating a new tailored model to account for the peculiar features of DNA array data where null expressions are planned by design. We also advocate the use of an alternative normalization device resulting from a suitable reparameterization. The new model is validated by using both simulated and our MTB data.

This work suggests that the presence of a substantial fraction of exact null expressions might be the effect of an imperfect background calibration and shows how this can be suitably re-calibrated with the information coming from control spots. The proposed idea can be extended to all experiments in which a subset of genes whose expression levels can be ascribed mainly to background noise is planned by design.","background correction,Bayesian hierarchical model,blank spots,differential expression,gene expression data,normalization issues","MICROARRAY EXPRESSION DATA,CDNA MICROARRAY,2-COLOR MICROARRAYS,P-VALUES,NORMALIZATION,IDENTIFICATION,PLATFORM","Arima, Serena@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Metodi & Modelli Econ Terr & Finanza, I-00161 Rome, Italy::Liseo, Brunero@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Metodi & Modelli Econ Terr & Finanza, I-00161 Rome, Italy::Mariani, Francesca@CNR, Ist Neurobiol & Med Mol, I-00185 Rome, Italy::Tardella, Luca@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Stat, I-00161 Rome, Italy","Arima, Serena@Sapienza University Rome::Liseo, Brunero@Sapienza University Rome::Mariani, Francesca@Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)::Tardella, Luca@Sapienza University Rome","TARDELLA, Luca@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5703-3909","Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution+Azzalini, A;

A main advantage of this method is that it is fast and does not require the use of iterative procedures. A model selection method is derived which allows to choose among these distributions.

In this paper, we will propose a transitional model for the analysis of change for a nominal response variable. Such an analysis is often hampered by the dimensionality of the problem. We use multidimensional scaling techniques, more specifically the ideal point model, in order to reduce the dimensionality. The model can handle pure transitional data but also allows for explanatory variables.

Bayesian latent variable models for spatially correlated tooth-level binary data in caries research,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100103,FEB 2011,40,3,"Analysis of dental caries is traditionally based on aggregated scores, which are summaries of caries experience for each individual. A well-known example of such scores is the decayed, missing and filled teeth or tooth surfaces index introduced in the 1930s. Although these scores have improved our understanding of the pattern of dental caries, there are still some fundamental questions that remain unanswered. As an example, it is well believed among dentists that there are spatial symmetries in the mouth with respect to caries, but this has never been evaluated in a statistical sense. An answer to this question requires the analysis to be performed at subunits within the mouth, which necessitates the use of methods for correlated data. We propose a Bayesian generalized latent variable model coupled with an undirected graphical model to investigate the unique spatial distribution of tooth-level caries outcomes in the mouth. Data from the Signal Tandmobiel (R) study in Flanders, a dental longitudinal survey, are used to illustrate the methodology.","hierarchical structure,latent variable,multivariate conditional autoregressive models,spatial correlation,undirected graphical Gaussian model","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,COMPUTATION,REGRESSION,SELECTION,OUTCOMES,SYSTEMS","Zhang, Y.); Todem, D (Todem, D.@Michigan State Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Div Biostat, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA::Kim, K.@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53706 USA::Lesaffre, E.@Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Med Ctr, Dept Biostat, Rotterdam, Netherlands@Katholieke Univ Leuven, L Biostat, Louvain, Belgium","Zhang, Y.); Todem, D (Todem, D.@Michigan State University::Kim, K.@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System::Lesaffre, E.@KU Leuven@Erasmus University Rotterdam@Erasmus University Medical Center",not exist,"Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::A new perspective on priors for generalized linear models+Bedrick, EJ; Christensen, R; Johnson, W+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::BAYESIAN COMPUTATION AND STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS+BESAG, J; GREEN, P; HIGDON, D; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 1995::Modelling tooth emergence data based on multivariate interval-censored data+Bogaerts, K; Leroy, R; Lesaffre, E; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2002::ON DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY + JOINT PROBABILITY APPROACHES IN SPECIFICATION OF NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR SYSTEMS+BROOK, D+BIOMETRIKA+1964::Deviance Information Criteria for Missing Data Models+Celeux, G.; Forbes, F.; Robert, C.

Building Cox-type structured hazard regression models with time-varying effects,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100102,FEB 2011,26,9,"In recent years, flexible hazard regression models based on penalized splines have been developed that allow us to extend the classical Cox model via the inclusion of time-varying and nonparametric effects. Despite their immediate appeal in terms of flexibility, these models introduce additional difficulties when a subset of covariates and the corresponding modelling alternatives have to be chosen. We present an analysis of data from a specific patient population with 90-day survival as the response variable. The aim is to determine a sensible prognostic model where some variables have to be included due to subject-matter knowledge while other variables are subject to model selection. Motivated by this application, we propose a two-stage stepwise model building strategy to choose both the relevant covariates and the corresponding modelling alternatives within the choice set of possible covariates simultaneously. For categorical covariates, competing modelling approaches are linear effects and time-varying effects, whereas nonparametric modelling provides a further alternative in case of continuous covariates. In our data analysis, we identified a prognostic model containing both smooth and time-varying effects.","hazard regression,mixed models,model building,prognostic model,P-splines,time-varying effects","AKAIKE INFORMATION,SURVIVAL MODELS,TRANSFORMATION,SELECTION,SPLINES","Hofner, Benjamin@Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Med Informat Biometrie & Epidemiol, D-8520 Erlangen, Germany::Kneib, Thomas@Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Math, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany::Hartl, Wolfgang@Univ Munich, Dept Surg, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Kuechenhoff, Helmut@Univ Munich, Inst Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Hofner, Benjamin@University of Erlangen Nuremberg::Kneib, Thomas@Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg::Hartl, Wolfgang@University of Munich::Kuechenhoff, Helmut@University of Munich","Kuchenhoff, Helmut@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6372-2487::Hofner, Benjamin@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2810-3186","Joint estimation of time-dependent and non-linear effects of continuous covariates on survival+Abrahamowicz, Michal; MacKenzie, Todd A.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JAN 30 2007::Generating survival times to simulate Cox proportional hazards models+Bender, R; Augustin, T; Blettner, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 2005::Mixed model-based hazard estimation+Cai, T; Hyndman, RJ; Wand, MP+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2002::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::no title+Dierckx, P.+CURVE SURFACE FITTIN+1993::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Consistent estimation of the expected brier score in general survival models with right-censored event times+Gerds, Thomas A.; Schumacher, Martin+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+DEC 2006::Strictly proper scoring rules, prediction, and estimation+Gneiting, Tilmann; Raftery, Adrian E.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2007::Assessment and comparison of prognostic classification schemes for survival data+Graf, E; Schmoor, C; Sauerbrei, W; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 30 1999::FLEXIBLE METHODS FOR ANALYZING SURVIVAL-DATA USING SPLINES, WITH APPLICATIONS TO BREAST-CANCER PROGNOSIS+GRAY, RJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1992::no title+GREVEN S+BIOMETRIKA IN PRESS+no time::no title+Hastie, T.

P-spline ANOVA-type interaction models for spatio-temporal smoothing,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100104,FEB 2011,31,28,"In recent years, spatial and spatio-temporal modelling have become an important area of research in many fields (epidemiology, environmental studies, disease mapping, etc.). However, most of the models developed are constrained by the large amounts of data available. We propose the use of penalized splines (P-splines) in a mixed model framework for smoothing spatio-temporal data. Our approach allows the consideration of interaction terms which can be decomposed as a sum of smooth functions similarly as an analysis of variance decomposition. The properties of the bases used for regression allow the use of algorithms that can handle large amount of data. We show that on imposing the same constraints as in a factorial design it is possible to avoid identifiability problems. We illustrate the methodology for Europe ozone levels in the period 1999-2005.","ANOVA decomposition,mixed models,Penalized splines,spatio-temporal data","STRUCTURED ADDITIVE REGRESSION,SPACE-TIME DATA,MIXED MODELS,LIKELIHOOD,RATES","Lee, Dae-Jin@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Escuela Politecn Super, Dept Estadist, Madrid 28911, Spain::Durban, Maria@Unknow","Lee, Dae-Jin@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Durban, Maria@Unknow","Lee, Dae-Jin@A-9106-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8995-8535::durban, maria@C-2504-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4272-7895","MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD IDENTIFICATION OF GAUSSIAN AUTOREGRESSIVE MOVING AVERAGE MODELS+AKAIKE, H+BIOMETRIKA+1973::Spatiotemporal smoothing and sulphur dioxide trends over Europe+Bowman, Adrian W.; Giannitrapani, Marco; Scott, E.

As with all multivariate approaches, the aim is to exploit potential inter-series dependencies to improve the fit and forecasts. The model is based around an unobserved vector of components representing features such as the level and slope of each time series. Equations that describe the evolution of these components through time are used to represent the inter-temporal dependencies. The approach is illustrated on a bivariate dataset comprising Australian exchange rates of the UK pound and US dollar. The forecasting accuracy of the new modelling framework is compared to other common uni- and multivariate approaches in an experiment using time series from a large macroeconomic database.","exponential smoothing,forecast comparison,multivariate time series,state space model,vector autoregression,vector innovations structural time series model","EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING MODEL,UNIT-ROOT,SAMPLE","de Silva, Ashton@RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia::Hyndman, Rob J.@Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia::Snyder, Ralph@Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","de Silva, Ashton@Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)::Hyndman, Rob J.@Monash University::Snyder, Ralph@Monash University","Hyndman, Rob@A-2268-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2140-5352::de Silva, Ashton@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1280-4511","no title+Anderson, B.

"Arbitrariness of models for augmented and coarse data, with emphasis on incomplete data and random effects models",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0901000403,DEC 2010,37,8,"Statistical models often extend beyond the data available. First, in coarse data, what is actually observed is less detailed than what might be, owing to incompleteness, censoring, grouping, or a combination thereof. Second, in augmented data, the observed data are hypothetically supplemented with random effects, latent variables/classes, or component membership in mixture distributions. The two settings together will be referred to as enriched data. Reasons for modelling enriched data encompass mathematical and computational convenience, advantages in interpretation, and substantive plausibility. Models for enriched data combine evidence coming from empirical data with unverifiable model components, resting entirely on assumptions.

This has acute consequences for enriched data, but knowledge about this issue is somewhat scattered. We provide a unified framework for enriched data and show, generally and with focus on incomplete-data models and random-effects models on the other hand, that to any given model an entire class of models can be assigned, with all of its members producing the same fit to the observed data but arbitrary regarding the unobservable parts of the enriched data. The concepts developed are illustrated using a clinical trial in toenail dermatophyte onychomycosis and a developmental toxicity study conducted in mice.","enriched data,exponential random effects,gamma random effects,missing data model,linear mixed model","PATTERN-MIXTURE MODELS,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS,MISSING DATA,DROP-OUT,INFERENCE,ONYCHOMYCOSIS,MICE","Verbeke, Geert@Univ Hasselt, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Molenberghs, Geert@Univ Hasselt, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium","Verbeke, Geert@Hasselt University@KU Leuven::Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt University@KU Leuven","Verbeke, Geert@I-5587-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8430-7576","TOXICITY AND HEALTH THREATS OF PHTHALATE ESTERS REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE+AUTIAN J+Environmental Health Perspectives+1973::A multifaceted sensitivity analysis of the Slovenian public opinion survey data+Beunckens, Caroline;

A Bayesian model for repeated measures zero-inflated count data with application to outpatient psychiatric service use,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0901000404,DEC 2010,52,55,"In applications involving count data, it is common to encounter an excess number of zeros. For example, in the study of outpatient service utilization, the number of utilization days will take on integer values, with many subjects having no utilization (zero values). Mixed distribution models, such as the zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial, are often used to fit such data. A more general class of mixture models, called hurdle models, can be used to model zero deflation as well as zero inflation. Several authors have proposed frequentist approaches to fitting zero-inflated models for repeated measures. We describe a practical Bayesian approach which incorporates prior information, has optimal small-sample properties and allows for tractable inference. The approach can be easily implemented using standard Bayesian software. A study of psychiatric outpatient service use illustrates the methods.","Bayesian inference,hurdle model,repeated measures,zero-altered model,zero-inflated model","MONTE-CARLO METHODS,PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,POISSON REGRESSION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,HURDLE MODELS,CONVERGENCE,SELECTION,OUTCOMES,PROGRAM,MIXTURE","Neelon, Brian H.@Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Childrens Environm Hlth Initiat, Durham, NC 27708 USA::O'Malley, A.

Heteroscedastic factor mixture analysis,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0901000405,DEC 2010,38,27,"When data come from an unobserved heterogeneous population, common factor analysis is not appropriate to estimate the underlying constructs of interest. By replacing the traditional assumption of Gaussian distributed factors by a finite mixture of multivariate Gaussians, the unobserved heterogeneity can be modelled by latent classes. In so doing, we obtain a particular factor mixture analysis with heteroscedastic components. In this paper, the model is presented and a maximum likelihood estimation procedure via the expectation-maximization algorithm is developed. We also show that the approach well performs as a dimensionally reduced model-based clustering. Two real applications are illustrated and performances are compared to standard model-based clustering methods.","EM algorithm,factor analysis,Gaussian mixture models,model-based clustering","INDEPENDENT FACTOR-ANALYSIS,HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,CLUSTER-ANALYSIS,MODEL,CLASSIFICATION,PREDICTION","Montanari, Angela@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy::Viroli, Cinzia@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Montanari, Angela@University of Bologna::Viroli, Cinzia@University of Bologna","Viroli, Cinzia@F-5786-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3278-5266::Montanari, Angela@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8369-1761","no title+ATCHLEY WR+CAN ENTOMOL+1971::Independent factor analysis+Attias, H+NEURAL COMPUTATION+MAY 15 1999::no title+BAEK J+PREPRINT SERIES I NE+2008::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::THE SENSITIVITY OF LATENT TRAIT ANALYSIS TO CHOICE OF PRIOR DISTRIBUTION+BARTHOLOMEW, DJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1988::Probabilistic models in cluster analysis+Bock, HH+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 15 1996::High-dimensional data clustering+Bouveyron, C.; Girard, S.; Schmid, C.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 15 2007::Model-based density estimation by Independent Factor Analysis+Calo, DG; Montanari, A; Viroli, C+FROM DATA AND INFORMATION ANALYSIS TO KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING+2006::Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm+Dempster, N; Laird, M; Rubin, DB.+J Royal Stat Soc Ser B+1977::CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF MULTIVARIATE DATA - EFFICIENCY VS INTERPRETABILITY OF CLASSIFICATIONS+FORGY, EW+BIOMETRICS+1965::Enhanced model-based clustering, density estimation, and discriminant analysis software: MCLUST+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+2003::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::Algorithms for model-based Gaussian hierarchical clustering+Fraley, C+SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING+1998::MCLUST: Software for Model-Based Clustering, Density Estimation, and Discriminant Analysis+FRALEY, C.; RAFTERY, A.E.+Technical Report 415+2002::The EM algorithm for mixtures of factor analyzers+Ghahramani, Z.; Hinton, G.+Technical report CRGTR-96-1+1997::no title+Gordon, AD.+Classification+1999::A K-means clustering algorithm+Hartigan, J.A.; Wong, M.A.+Applied Statistics+1979::COMPARING PARTITIONS+HUBERT, L; ARABIE, P+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1985::no title+Hyvarinen, A.; Karhunen, J.; Oja, E.+Independent Component Analysis+2001::SIMULTANEOUS FACTOR ANALYSIS IN SEVERAL POPULATIONS+JORESKOG, KG+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1971::SOME CONTRIBUTIONS TO MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FACTOR ANALYSIS+JORESKOG, KG+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1967::Classification and diagnostic prediction of cancers using gene expression profiling and artificial neural networks+Khan, J; Wei, JS; Ringner, M; et al.+NATURE MEDICINE+JUN 2001::The estimation of factor loadings by the method of maximum likelihood+Lawley, D.+P ROY SOC EDINB A+1940::ICA mixture models for unsupervised classification of non-Gaussian classes and automatic context switching in blind signal separation+Lee, TW; Lewicki, MS; Sejnowski, TJ+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+OCT 2000::Testing the number of components in a normal mixture+Lo, YT; Mendell, NR; Rubin, DB+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2001::Investigating population heterogeneity with factor mixture models+Lubke, GH; Muthen, B+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 2005::no title+Mardia, K.+Multivariate Analysis+1976::no title+McLachlan, G.; Peel, D.+Finite mixture models+2000::Modelling high-dimensional data by mixtures of factor analyzers+McLachlan, GJ; Peel, D; Bean, RW+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE, FACTOR-ANALYSIS AND FACTORIAL INVARIANCE+MEREDITH, W+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1993::MULTIPLE-GROUP STRUCTURAL MODELING WITH NON-NORMAL CONTINUOUS-VARIABLES+MUTHEN, B+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1989::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::no title+TITTERINGTON, D.

Modelling multivariate disease rates with a latent structure mixture model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000301,OCT 2010,48,3,"There has been considerable recent interest in multivariate modelling of the geographical distribution of morbidity or mortality rates for potentially related diseases. The motivations for this include investigation of similarities or dissimilarities in the risk distribution for the different diseases, as well as 'borrowing strength' across disease rates to shrink the uncertainty in geographical risk assessment for any particular disease. A number of approaches to such multivariate modelling have been suggested and this paper proposes an extension to these which may provide a richer range of dependency structures than those encompassed so far. We develop a model which incorporates a discrete mixture of latent structures and argue that this provides potential to represent an enhanced range of correlation structures between diseases at the same time as implicitly allowing for less restrictive spatial correlation structures between geographical units. We compare and contrast our approach to other commonly used multivariate disease models and demonstrate comparative results using data taken from cancer registries on four carcinomas in some 300 geographical units in England, Scotland and Wales.","factor analysis,latent structure,mixture model,multivariate disease rates","SPATIAL FACTOR-ANALYSIS,CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,EQUATION MODELS,CORRELATED DATA,ISSUES,PREDICTION,COMPONENTS,NUMBER,JOINT","Hewson, P.

Finite mixture models for clustering multilevel data with multiple cluster structures,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000302,OCT 2010,25,1,"Finite mixture models are useful tools for clustering two-way datasets within a sound statistical framework which can assess some important questions, such as how many clusters are there in the data. Models that can also be used for clustering multilevel data have been proposed, with the intent to produce clusterings of units at every level on the basis of all the available variables, considering the hierarchical structure of the dataset. This paper introduces a new class of mixture models for datasets with two levels that makes it possible to discover a clustering of level 2 units and different clusterings of level 1 units corresponding to different subsets of the variables (multiple cluster structures). This new class is obtained by adapting a mixture model proposed to identify multiple cluster structures in a data matrix to the multilevel situation. The usefulness of the new method is shown using simulated data and a real example.","cluster analysis,cluster structure,mixture model,model selection,multilevel data","LATENT CLASS,VARIABLE-SELECTION","Galimberti, Giuliano@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy::Soffritti, Gabriele@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Galimberti, Giuliano@University of Bologna::Soffritti, Gabriele@University of Bologna","Galimberti, Giuliano@J-5353-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9161-9671","Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::A generalized clustering problem, with application to DNA microarrays+Belitskaya-Levy, Ilana+STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY+2006::MODEL SELECTION AND AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) - THE GENERAL-THEORY AND ITS ANALYTICAL EXTENSIONS+BOZDOGAN, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::Mixture-model Cluster Analysis Using Model Selection Criteria and a New Informational Measure of Complexity+Bozdogan, H.+The first US/Japan Conf. on the Frontiers of Statistical Modeling: An Informational Approach+1994::A variable-selection heuristic for K-means clustering+Brusco, MJ; Cradit, JD+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2001::Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm+Dempster, A.

Flexible hazard ratio curves for continuous predictors in multi-state models: an application to breast cancer data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000303,OCT 2010,42,12,"Multi-state models (MSMs) are very useful for describing complicated event history data. These models may be considered as a generalization of survival analysis where survival is the ultimate outcome of interest but where intermediate (transient) states are identified. One major goal in clinical applications of MSMs is to study the relationship between the different covariates and disease evolution. Usually, MSMs are assumed to be parametric, and the effects of continuous predictors on log-hazards are modelled linearly. In practice, however, the effect of a given continuous predictor can be unknown, and its form may be different in all transitions. In this paper, we propose a P-spline approach that allows for non-linear relationships between continuous predictors and survival in the multi-state framework. To better understand the effects at each transition, results are expressed in terms of hazard ratio curves, taking a specific covariate value as reference. Confidence bands for these curves are also derived. The proposed methodology was applied to a database on breast cancer, using a progressive three-state model. This application revealed hitherto unreported effects: whereas DNA index is only an important non-linear predictor of recurrence, the percentage of cells in phase S is a significant predictor of both recurrence and mortality.","Cox model,hazard ratio,multi-state model,penalized splines","BAYESIAN P-SPLINES,REGRESSION-MODELS,SURVIVAL,PROGNOSIS,MARKERS,RISK","Cadarso-Suarez, Carmen@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Sch Med, Biostat Unit, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain@IDIS, Santiago De Compostela, Spain::Meira-Machado, Luis@Univ Minho, Dept Math & Appl, P-4719 Braga, Portugal::Kneib, Thomas@Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Math, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany::Gude, Francisco@Univ Santiago, Hosp Clin, Clin Epidemiol Unit, Santiago De Compostela, Spain@IDIS, Santiago De Compostela, Spain","Cadarso-Suarez, Carmen@University of Santiago De Compostela::Meira-Machado, Luis@Universidade do Minho::Kneib, Thomas@Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg::Gude, Francisco@Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela","Machado, Luis@W-2024-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8577-7665","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::DANGERS OF USING OPTIMAL CUTPOINTS IN THE EVALUATION OF PROGNOSTIC FACTORS+ALTMAN, DG; LAUSEN, B; SAUERBREI, W; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE+JUN 1 1994::Multi-state models for event history analysis+Andersen, PK; Keiding, N+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+APR 2002::no title+Andersen, PK; Borgan, O; Gill, RD<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Keiding, N</span>.+Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes+1993::Multi-state models for bleeding episodes and mortality in liver cirrhosis+Andersen, PK; Esbjerg, S; Sorensen, TIA+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 29 2000::MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION+ANDERSON, GL; FLEMING, TR+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1995::Generalized structured additive regression based on Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 24 2006::BayesX: Analyzing Bayesian structured additive regression models+Brezger, A; Kneib, T; Lang, S+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+SEP 2005::Hypoploidy defines patients with poor prognosis in breast cancer+Chavez-Uribe, Elisabet; Cameselle-Teijeiro, Jose; Vinuela, Juan E.; et al.+ONCOLOGY REPORTS+MAY 2007::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::no title+De Boor,, C.+A practical Guide to Splines+2001::Fast and compact smoothing on large multidimensional grids+Eilers, PHC; Currie, ID; Durban, M+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 10 2006::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Comparing smoothing techniques in Cox models for exposure-response relationships+Govindarajulu, Usha S.; Spiegelman, Donna; Thurston, Sally W.; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 10 2007::FLEXIBLE METHODS FOR ANALYZING SURVIVAL-DATA USING SPLINES, WITH APPLICATIONS TO BREAST-CANCER PROGNOSIS+GRAY, RJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1992::DOSE-RESPONSE AND TREND ANALYSIS IN EPIDEMIOLOGY - ALTERNATIVES TO CATEGORICAL ANALYSIS+GREENLAND, S+EPIDEMIOLOGY+JUL 1995::American society of clinical oncology 2007 update of recommendations for the use of tumor markers in breast cancer+Harris, Lyndsay; Fritsche, Herbert; Mennel, Robert; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+NOV 20 2007::EXPLORING THE NATURE OF COVARIATE EFFECTS IN THE PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL+HASTIE, T; TIBSHIRANI, R+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1990::no title+Hastie, T.

Robust frailty modelling using non-proportional hazards models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000304,OCT 2010,39,1,"Correlated survival times can be modelled by introducing a random effect, or frailty component, into the hazard function. For multivariate survival data, we extend a non-proportional hazards (PH) model, the generalized time-dependent logistic survival model, to include random effects. The hierarchical likelihood procedure, which obviates the need for marginalization over the random effect distribution, is derived for this extended model and its properties are discussed. The extended model leads to a robust estimation result for the regression parameters against the misspecification of the form of the basic hazard function or frailty distribution compared to PH-based alternatives. The proposed method is illustrated by two practical examples and a simulation study which demonstrate the advantages of the new model.","frailtymodels,generalized time-dependent logistic,hierarchical likelihood,non-PH model,random effect","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,HIERARCHICAL-LIKELIHOOD APPROACH,SURVIVAL ANALYSIS,PROPORTIONAL-HAZARDS,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,REML ESTIMATION,REGRESSION","Do Ha, Il@Daegu Haany Univ, Dept Asset Management, Taegu, South Korea::MacKenzie, Gilbert@Univ Limerick, Ctr Biostat, Dept Math & Stat, Limerick, Ireland@ENSAI, Rennes, France","Do Ha, Il@Unknow::MacKenzie, Gilbert@Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information (ENSAI)@University of Limerick",not exist,"Examples in which misspecification of a random effects distribution reduces efficiency, and possible remedies+Agresti, A; Caffo, B; Ohman-Strickland, P+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 2004::no title+BLAGOJEVIC M+CORRELATED DATA MODE+2007::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::no title+Cox, DR.+The Analysis of Binary Data+1970::Model selection for multi-component frailty models+Do Ha, Il; Lee, Youngjo; MacKenzie, Gilbert+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 20 2007::Simulation study for misspecifications on a frailty model+Ferreira, A.; Garcia, N.+Brazilian Journal of Probability and Statistics+2001::no title+Fleming, T.

Quantile regression analysis of the Italian school system,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000305,OCT 2010,9,4,"We analyze the score on a reading literacy test of 15-year-old Italian students. The data depict a fracture in the Italian school system. By means of quantile regressions (QR) and by repeatedly implementing a QR-based test for structural break, computed in different sub-samples and at various quantiles, we can not only pin down the determinants of the gap but also rank them. We find that the difference in curricula is the main factor in explaining the gap in the students' scores, and the regional difference is linked to structural and behavioural variables, like poor library facilities and student absenteeism, both mirroring the economic lag of the southern Italian regions. In terms of policy actions, curbing absenteeism in the south could help reduce the regional gap. If instead the target is to enhance excellence, funds could be directed towards academic track and/or north-centre regions.","quantile regression,structural break,test",TESTS,"Furno, Marilena@Univ Cassino, Dept Econ, Cassino, Italy","Furno, Marilena@University of Cassino","FURNO, Marilena@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6635-8476","LEAST ABSOLUTE DEVIATION ESTIMATION OF A SHIFT+BAI, JS+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 1995::Geographical Differences in Italian Students' Mathematical Competencies: Evidence from PISA 2003+Bratti, M.; Checchi, D.; Filippin, A.+Giornale degli Economisti e Annali di Economia+2007::Recent advances in quantile regression models - A practical guideline for empirical research+Buchinsky, M+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+WIN 1998::TESTS OF EQUALITY BETWEEN SETS OF COEFFICIENTS IN 2 LINEAR REGRESSIONS+CHOW, GC+ECONOMETRICA+1960::no title+FURNO M+QUANTILE REGRESSIONS+2008::Parameter instability in quantile regression+Furno, Marilena+STATISTICAL MODELLING+DEC 2007::TESTS OF LINEAR HYPOTHESES AND L1 ESTIMATION+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1982::REGRESSION QUANTILES+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1978::Goodness of fit and related inference processes for quantile regression+Koenker, R; Machado, JAF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1999"
Extreme value methods for modelling historical series of large volcanic magnitudes,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000201,JUL 2010,9,10,"Volcanic eruptions are among the most extreme events on earth and it seems natural to make use of the theory of extreme values to improve understanding of volcanic processes. The dataset we use is a catalogue of large eruptions over the last two millennia, in which the date of occurrence and magnitude are recorded. The dataset is affected by a recording bias, mostly for eruptions of lower magnitude, though this under-recording process largely disappears in the most recent 400 years. Coles and Sparks modelled these data, via maximum likelihood, using a Poisson process motivated by extreme value theory, with an intensity function that takes into account the recording bias. Nevertheless, the fitted model did not seem entirely consistent with the observed data, since this intensity function does not represent effectively the temporal evolution of the censoring effect in the recording process. The aim of the paper is to provide a more flexible model that might fit better the under-recording process, through an alternative intensity function based on a change-point model. Moreover, the Bayesian context we use allows us to refine some inferential aspects of the return period calculation to improve forecast accuracy.","censored data,change-point model,extreme values,MCMC,volcanic eruptions",,"Furlan, Claudia@Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, I-35121 Padua, Italy","Furlan, Claudia@University of Padua",not exist,"no title+Coles, S.+An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values+2001::no title+COLES SG+SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS+2006::RATES OF MAGMA EMPLACEMENT AND VOLCANIC OUTPUT+CRISP, JA+JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH+1984::no title+Gilks, W.; Richardson, S.; Spiegelhalter, D.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice+1996::A primer in Markov Chain Monte Carlo+Green, PJ.+Complex Stochastic Systems+2001::no title+Hayakawa, Y.+Hayakawa's 2000-year eruption catalog+1997::The size and frequency of the largest explosive eruptions on Earth+Mason, BG; Pyle, DM; Oppenheimer, C+BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY+DEC 2004::no title+no author+R: a language and environment for statistical computing+2006::no title+Simkin, T.; Siebert, L.+Volcanoes of the World+1994"
Latent regression analysis,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000202,JUL 2010,44,5,"Finite mixture models have come to play a very prominent role in modelling data. The finite mixture model is predicated on the assumption that distinct latent groups exist in the population. The finite mixture model therefore is based on a categorical latent variable that distinguishes the different groups. Often in practice, distinct sub-populations do not actually exist. For example, disease severity (e.g., depression) may vary continuously and therefore, a distinction of diseased and non-diseased may not be based on the existence of distinct sub-populations. Thus, what is needed is a generalization of the finite mixture's discrete latent predictor to a continuous latent predictor. We cast the finite mixture model as a regression model with a latent Bernoulli predictor. A latent regression model is proposed by replacing the discrete Bernoulli predictor by a continuous latent predictor with a beta distribution. Motivation for the latent regression model arises from applications where distinct latent classes do not exist, but instead individuals vary according to a continuous latent variable. The shapes of the beta density are very flexible and can approximate the discrete Bernoulli distribution. Examples and a simulation are provided to illustrate the latent regression model. In particular, the latent regression model is used to model placebo effect among drug-treated subjects in a depression study.","beta distribution,EM algorithm,finite and infinite mixtures,placebo effect,quasi-Newton algorithms,skew-normal distribution","NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS,MAJOR DEPRESSION,CLINICAL-TRIALS,EM ALGORITHM,MODELS,MIXTURE,PLACEBO,LIKELIHOOD,OUTCOMES","Tarpey, Thaddeus@Wright State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Dayton, OH 45435 USA::Petkova, Eva@NYU, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, New York, NY USA@Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, New York, NY USA","Tarpey, Thaddeus@Wright State University Dayton::Petkova, Eva@Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research@New York University","Petkova, Eva@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5129-9442","LOGISTIC-NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS - SOME PROPERTIES AND USES+AITCHISON, J; SHEN, SM+BIOMETRIKA+1980::Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::Latent variable regression for multiple discrete outcomes+Bandeen-Roche, K; Miglioretti, DL; Zeger, SL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::Allometric extension+Bartoletti, S; Flury, BD; Nel, DG+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1999::The use of mixtures for dealing with non-normal regression errors+Bartolucci, F; Scaccia, L+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 1 2005::Latent Dirichlet allocation+Blei, DM; Ng, AY; Jordan, MI+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+MAY 15 2003::CLINICAL-FEATURES OF DEPRESSED-PATIENTS WHO DO AND DO NOT IMPROVE WITH PLACEBO+BROWN, WA; JOHNSON, MF; CHEN, MG+PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH+MAR 1992::IDENTIFIABILITY OF CONTINUOUS MIXTURES OF UNKNOWN GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS+BRUNI, C; KOCH, G+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+1985::A LIMITED MEMORY ALGORITHM FOR BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION+BYRD, RH; LU, PH; NOCEDAL, J; et al.+SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING+SEP 1995::ESTIMATING COMPONENTS OF A MIXTURE OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+DAY, NE+BIOMETRIKA+1969::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Mixture models for estimating the size of a closed population when capture rates vary among individuals+Dorazio, RM; Royle, JA+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2003::Bayesian estimation of the grade of membership model+Erosheva, EA+BAYESIAN STATISTICS 7+2003::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF THE PARAMETERS IN A MIXTURE OF 2 UNIVARIATE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS - A COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS+EVERITT, BS+STATISTICIAN+1984::Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation+Fraley, C; Raftery, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::EXPLORATORY LATENT STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS USING BOTH IDENTIFIABLE AND UNIDENTIFIABLE MODELS+GOODMAN, LA+BIOMETRIKA+1974::Latent class regression on latent factors+Guo, J; Wall, M; Amemiya, Y+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2006::On three and five parameter bivariate beta distributions+Gupta, A.K.; Wong, C.F.+Metrika+1985::A K-means clustering algorithm+Hartigan, J.A.; Wong, M.A.+Applied Statistics+1979::no title+Hastie, T.; Tibshirani, R.; Friedman, J.+The Elements of Statistical Learning+2001::Clustering for sparsely sampled functional data+James, GM; Sugar, CA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2003::no title+JOHNSON NL+ENCY STAT SCI+1988::no title+Johnson, R.A.; Wichern, D.W.+Applied multivariate statistical analysis+2005::The placebo enigma in antidepressant clinical trials+Khan, A; Brown, WA+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY+APR 2001::FlexMix: a general framework for finite mixture models and latent class regression in R+Leisch, F.+J Stat Softw+2004::Some methods for classification and analysis of multivariate observations+MacQueen, J.+Proc. of the fifth Berkeley Symp. on Math.

Modelling distortions in seroprevalence data using change-point fractional polynomials,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000203,JUL 2010,29,6,This paper shows how to model seroprevalence data using change-point fractional polynomials (FPs). The inclusion of a change point in the FP framework allows to detect distortions arising from common (often untestable) assumptions made in the estimation of the age-specific prevalence and force of infection from cross-sectional data. The method is motivated using seroprevalence data on the parvovirus B19 and the varicella zoster virus in Belgium.,"change point,detecting distortions,fractional polynomial,model selection criteria,seroprevalence data","2-SEGMENTED LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,VARICELLA-ZOSTER-VIRUS,PARVOVIRUS B19,PREVALENCE DATA,INFECTION,SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY,COUNTRIES,FORCES,RISK","Hens, N.@Hasselt Univ, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Catholic Univ Louvain, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Kvitkovicova, A.@Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic::Aerts, M.@Hasselt Univ, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Catholic Univ Louvain, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Hlubinka, D.@Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic::Beutels, P.@Univ Antwerp, Ctr Evaluat Vaccinat, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium","Hens, N.@Hasselt University@Universite Catholique Louvain::Kvitkovicova, A.@Charles University Prague::Aerts, M.@Hasselt University@Universite Catholique Louvain::Hlubinka, D.@Charles University Prague::Beutels, P.@University of Antwerp","Kraus, Andrea@F-5555-2015::Hens, Niel@M-4445-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1881-0637::Hlubinka, Daniel@C-6385-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4016-3632::Beutels, Philippe@A-1919-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5034-3595","Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::no title+Anderson, R.

Smooth models of mortality with period shocks,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000204,JUL 2010,20,4,"We suppose that we have mortality data arranged in two tables: one of deaths and the other of exposures to the risk of death, each classified by age at death and year of death. It is natural to suppose that there is a smooth underlying force of mortality, the mortality surface, that varies with age and year (or period). However, observed mortality is subject to more than stochastic deviation from this smooth surface. For example, flu epidemics, hot summers or cold winters can disproportionately affect the mortality of certain age groups in particular years. We call such an effect a period shock. We describe the mortality surface with an additive model with two components: the underlying smooth surface is modelled with two-dimensional P-splines and the period shocks are modelled with one-dimensional P-splines in the age direction, one P-spline for each year. This large regression model is written as an additive generalized linear array model and this enables the computations to be performed efficiently. We illustrate our methods with Swedish mortality data taken from the Human Mortality Database.","generalized linear array model,mortality,period shock,P-splines,smoothing","SPLINE,RATES","Kirkby, J.

Predicting the amount individuals withdraw at cash machines using a random effects multinomial model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000205,JUL 2010,18,6,"Retail finance organizations use data on past behaviour to make predictions for customer value management strategies. Random-effects models, where each individual has a behavioural pattern drawn from an overall population distribution, are a natural statistical form in this context. The random effects models in this paper are used to predict how much individuals withdraw at a single cash machine visit. A multinomial distribution is taken for the distribution of amounts and the random effects are modelled by a Dirichlet distribution or the empirical distribution of individual maximum likelihood fits. A third model extends the multinomial distribution by incorporating a form of serial dependence and uses an empirical distribution for the random effects. Several prediction tests on a sample of 5000 UK high-street bank accounts find that the greatest benefit from the models is for accounts with a small number of past transactions; that little information may be lost by binning and that the Dirichlet distribution might overestimate the probability of previously unobserved withdrawal amounts. The empirical distribution of random effects is found to perform well because there are a large number of individual accounts.","ATM,cash withdrawal,customer,personal banking,prediction,random effects,retail banking",,"Brentnall, Adam R.@Univ London, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, Wolfson Inst Prevent Med, London, England::Crowder, Martin J.@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2PG, England::Hand, David J.@Univ London, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, Wolfson Inst Prevent Med, London, England@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2PG, England","Brentnall, Adam R.@University of London@Queen Mary University London::Crowder, Martin J.@Imperial College London::Hand, David J.@University of London@Queen Mary University London@Imperial College London","Brentnall, Adam@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6327-4357","no title+AMROMIN E+DEBIT CARD CASH USAG+2007::Cash management, payment patterns and the demand for money+Boeschoten, WC+ECONOMIST+APR 1998::A statistical model for the temporal pattern of individual automated teller machine withdrawals+Brentnall, Adam R.; Crowder, Martin J.; Hand, David J.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2008::Verification of forecasts expressed in terms of probability+Brier, G.

Small area estimation under Fay-Herriot models with non-parametric estimation of heteroscedasticity,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000206,JUL 2010,15,4,"Fay-Herriot models relate direct estimators of small area means to vectors of area-level auxiliary covariates. Estimation of error variances in these models is a problem because of the lack of data within areas. A non-parametric approach is proposed for estimating these variances. Estimators of the remaining model parameters are derived and their asymptotic properties are studied. Moreover, small area estimators that incorporate the estimated error variances are obtained and several simple estimators of the mean squared error of these estimators are proposed. Simulation experiments study the small sample performance of the new small area estimators and compare the different estimators of the mean squared errors. Finally, the results are applied to the estimation of unemployment proportions in Spanish domains.","bandwidth parameter,bootstrap,kernel estimation,linear mixed model,small area estimation","MEAN SQUARED ERROR,PREDICTION,PARAMETERS","Gonzalez-Manteiga, W.@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Estad & Invest Operat, Santiago De Compostela 15706, Spain::Lombardia, M.

Transfer functions in dynamic generalized linear models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000102,APR 2010,34,8,"In a time series analysis it is sometimes necessary to assume that the effect of a regressor does not have only immediate impact on the mean response, but that its effects somehow propagate to future times. We adopt, in this work, transfer functions to model such impacts, represented by structural blocks present in dynamic generalized linear models. All the inference is carried under the Bayesian paradigm. Two sources of difficulties emerge for the analytical derivation of posterior distributions: non-Gaussian nature of the response, associated to non-conjugate priors and also non-linearity of the predictor on auto regressive parameters present in transfer functions. The purpose of this work is to produce full Bayesian inference on dynamic generalized linear models with transfer functions, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to build samples of the posterior joint distribution of the parameters involved in such models. Several transfer structures are specified, associated to Poisson, Binomial, Gamma and inverse Gaussian responses. Simulated data are analyzed under the resulting models in order to assess their performance. Finally, two applications to real data concerning environmental sciences are made under different model formulations.","Bayesian inference,dynamic generalized linear models,Markov chainMonte Carlo,transfer functions","STATE-SPACE MODELS,TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS,DISTRIBUTED LAG,SIMULATION SMOOTHER,MONTE-CARLO,REGRESSION,COUNTS","Alves, Mariane B.@Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Inst Matemat & Estatist, Dept Estatist, BR-20559900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil::Gamerman, Dani@Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Inst Matemat, Dept Metodos Estatist, BR-20559900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil::Ferreira, Marco A.

A generalized linear model with a composite link function is presented to formulate log linear models that take the RR design into account. The approach is extended to model the situation where some respondents do not follow the instructions of the RR design. For example, if there are three binary RR variables with regard to practicing fraud, the 2 x 2 x 2 cross-classification of the true answers is latent due to the misclassification. Using composite link functions, log linear models can be specified for the latent table to investigate possible association between the variables. Fast iteratively re-weighted least squares algorithms are presented.","iteratively re-weighted least squares,misclassification,sensitive questions",,"van den Hout, Ardo@Inst Publ Hlth, MRC Biostat Unit, Cambridge, England::Gilchrist, Robert@London Metropolitan Univ, STORM Res Ctr, London, England::van der Heijden, Peter G.

Causal hidden variable model of pathogenic contamination from pig to pork,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000105,APR 2010,35,10,"Risk assessments relating to food safety over more than one step along a production chain are frequently hampered by lack of detailed quantitative data. This study set out to develop a Bayesian hidden variable model to integrate available limited data of the combined occurrence of three bacterial pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, with causal assumptions along three steps of pork production chain. The pathogen occurrence data were animal specific both on conventional and organic pig farms and at the abattoir, but merely farm specific at meat cutting plants. The model was able to incorporate all data concerning different types of testing at different steps of the chain, and missing data values were dealt with in a straightforward manner. It provides a tool for quantitative risk assessments and for estimating the causal risk mitigation effects by combining external data with the specific follow-up data. Intervention effects are provided with Bayesian credible intervals indicating the uncertainty due to all information sources included in the model. Combined prevalence in Finnish pork was estimated to be 1-11% and it could be reduced to 0-2% if head was removed intact and rectum sealed off.","Bayesian causal model,food safety,Listeria,pork production,risk assessment,Yersinia","QUANTITATIVE RISK-ASSESSMENT,YERSINIA-ENTEROCOLITICA,LISTERIA-MONOCYTOGENES,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,SALMONELLA,MEAT,TRANSMISSION,SLAUGHTER,FRAMEWORK,OUTBREAK","Ranta, Jukka@Finnish Food Safety Author Evira, Risk Assessment Unit, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland::Siekkinen, Kirsi-Maarit@Finnish Food Safety Author Evira, Risk Assessment Unit, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland::Nuotio, Lasse@Unknow::Laukkanen, Riikka@Univ Helsinki, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg & Environm Hlth, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland::Hellstrom, Sanna@Univ Helsinki, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg & Environm Hlth, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland::Korkeala, Hannu@Univ Helsinki, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg & Environm Hlth, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland::Maijala, Riitta@Univ Helsinki, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg & Environm Hlth, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Ranta, Jukka@Unknow::Siekkinen, Kirsi-Maarit@Unknow::Nuotio, Lasse@Unknow::Laukkanen, Riikka@University of Helsinki::Hellstrom, Sanna@University of Helsinki::Korkeala, Hannu@University of Helsinki::Maijala, Riitta@University of Helsinki","Laukkanen-Ninios, Riikka@F-5175-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7504-4305::Korkeala, Hannu@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0699-1290","Where should the effort be put to reduce the Salmonella prevalence in the slaughtered swine carcass effectively?+Alban, L; Stark, KDC+PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE+APR 2005::Qualitative and quantitative risk assessment for human salmonellosis due to multi-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 from consumption of Danish dry-cured pork sausages+Alban, L; Olsen, AM; Nielsen, B; et al.+PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE+JAN 22 2002::Microbiology of Food and Animal Feeding Stuffs - Horizontal Method for the Detection and Enumeration of Listeria Monocytogenes - Part 1: Detectiontion Method+[Anonymous].+International Standard ISO 11290-1/Amd1:2004+1996::Horizontal method for the detection of presumptive pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica+[Anonymous].+ISO 10273+2003::Listeria monocytogenes contamination pattern in pig slaughterhouses+Autio, T; Sateri, T; Fredriksson-Ahomaa, M; et al.+JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION+OCT 2000::no title+BANKS D+RISK ANAL PANEL GENE+2004::The Case for Objective Bayesian Analysis+Berger, James+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::An outbreak of Salmonella Munchen in Germany associated with raw pork meat+Buchholz, U; Brodhun, B; Brockmann, SO; et al.+JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION+FEB 2005::Molecular epidemiology of Listeria monocytogenes, isolates collected from the environment, raw meat and raw products in two poultry- and pork-processing plants+Chasseignaux, E; Toquin, MT; Ragimbeau, C; et al.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY+NOV 2001::Latent transition analysis with covariates: pubertal timing and substance use behaviours in adolescent females+Chung, H; Park, Y; Lanza, ST+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 30 2005::Analysing change based on two measures taken under different conditions+Clarke, PS+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 30 2005::no title+Congdon, P.+Applied Bayesian Modelling+2003::Sporadic human Yersinia enterocolitica infections caused by bioserotype 4/O : 3 originate mainly from pigs+Fredriksson-Ahomaa, M; Stolle, A; Siitonen, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY+JUN 2006::Inter-rater reliability of nursing home surveys: a Bayesian latent class approach+Gajewski, BJ; Thompson, S; Dunton, N; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JAN 30 2006::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

Bayesian calibration of hydrocarbon reservoir models using an approximate reservoir simulator in the prior specification,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0801000106,APR 2010,15,4,"We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for the 'history matching' problem in petroleum reservoir evaluation. Unknown reservoir properties are represented on a fine three dimensional lattice. A 'reservoir simulator' takes the reservoir properties as input and gives production properties as output. The history matching problem is to infer the reservoir properties from the observed production history. To run the reservoir simulator on the lattice size of interest is computer intensive, and this severely limits the number of runs possible.

We formulate the problem in a Bayesian setting and, following suggestions in the statistical literature, consider the reservoir simulator as an unknown function. To obtain a realistic prior distribution for this function, we propose to combine a coarse lattice (faster) version of the simulator with parameters correcting for bias introduced by the coarser lattice. We simulate from the resulting posterior by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We construct an artificial reference reservoir, generate corresponding flow observations, and use our procedure to evaluate the reservoir properties in the resulting posterior distribution. Convergence and mixing are acceptable. The case study demonstrates how the observed production history provides information about both the reservoir properties and the bias correcting parameters included in the prior specification.","approximate reservoir simulation,Bayesian statistics,complex computer model,Markov chain Monte Carlo,parameter estimation,production conditioning","PRODUCTION FORECASTS,HISTORY","Lodoen, Ole Petter@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway::Tjelmeland, Hakon@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway","Lodoen, Ole Petter@Norwegian University of Science & Technology@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)::Tjelmeland, Hakon@Norwegian University of Science & Technology@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)",not exist,"Bayes linear strategies for matching hydrocarbon reservoir history+Craig, P.

Tutorial on methods for interval-censored data and their implementation in R,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0900900402,DEC 2009,73,55,"Interval censoring is encountered in many practical situations when the event of interest cannot be observed and it is only known to have occurred within a time window. The theory for the analysis of interval-censored data has been developed over the past three decades and several reviews have been written. However, it is still a common practice in medical and reliability studies to simplify the interval censoring structure of the data into a more standard right censoring situation by, for instance, imputing the midpoint of the censoring interval. The availability of software for right censoring might well be the main reason for this simplifying practice. In contrast, several methods have been developed to deal with interval-censored data and the corresponding algorithms to make the procedures feasible are scattered across the statistical software or remain behind the personal computers of many researchers. The purpose of this tutorial is to present, in a pedagogical and unified manner, the methodology and the available software for analyzing interval-censored data. The paper covers frequentist non-parametric, parametric and semiparametric estimating approaches, non-parametric tests for comparing survival curves and a section on simulation of interval-censored data. The methods and the software are described using the data from a dental study.","interval censoring,simulation,software R,survival analysis","PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL,FAILURE TIME MODEL,SEMIPARAMETRIC REGRESSION-ANALYSIS,NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION,ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES,MULTIPLE IMPUTATION,SURVIVAL ANALYSIS,COVARIATE,TESTS,ALGORITHM","Gomez, Guadalupe@Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Estadist & IO, Barcelona, Spain::Luz Calle, M.@Univ Vic, Dept Biol Sistemes, Vic, Spain::Oller, Ramon@Univ Vic, Dept Econ Matemat & Informat, Vic, Spain::Langohr, Klaus@Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Estadist & IO, Barcelona, Spain","Gomez, Guadalupe@Polytechnic University of Catalonia::Luz Calle, M.@Universitat de Vic::Oller, Ramon@Universitat de Vic::Langohr, Klaus@Polytechnic University of Catalonia","Calle, M.Luz@D-2704-2015::Oller, Ramon@G-4676-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4333-0021::Gomez, Guadalupe@K-5352-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4252-4884::Langohr, Klaus@B-7825-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7075-9192","no title+Allison, P.D.+Survival Analysis Using the SAS System.

The regression analysis of correlated interval-censored data: illustration using accelerated failure time models with flexible distributional assumptions,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0900900403,DEC 2009,18,6,The accelerated failure time (AFT) model is a useful alternative to the proportional hazard model for modelling interval-censored survival times. We illustrate the usefulness of a class of flexible AFT models. Flexibility is achieved by assuming that the distributional parts consist of penalized Gaussian mixtures.

Linear transformation models for interval-censored data: prediction of survival probability and model checking,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0900900404,DEC 2009,54,6,"In statistical analysis, when the value of a random variable is only known to be between two bounds, we say that this random variable is interval censored. This complicated censoring pattern is a common problem in research fields such as clinical trials or actuarial studies and raises challenges for statistical analysis. In this paper, we focus on regression analysis of case 2 interval-censored data. We first briefly review existing regression methods and an estimation approach under the class of linear transformation models developed by Zhang et al. We then propose a method for survival probability prediction via generalized estimating equations. We also consider a graphical model checking technique and a model selection tool. Some theoretical properties are established and the performance of our procedures is evaluated and illustrated by numerical studies including a real-life data analysis.","case 2 interval censoring,generalized estimating equation,linear transformation regression models,model checking,survival probability prediction","PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL,FAILURE-TIME REGRESSION,ASYMPTOTICALLY OPTIMAL ESTIMATION,SMOOTH FUNCTIONALS,LIKELIHOOD,ESTIMATOR,ALGORITHM,INFECTION,HEMOPHILIA","Zhang, Zhigang@Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, New York, NY 10021 USA","Zhang, Zhigang@Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center",not exist,"Generalized additive models with interval-censored data and time-varying covariates: Application to human immunodeficiency virus infection in hemophiliacs+Bacchetti, P; Quale, C+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2002::Computationally simple accelerated failure time regression for interval censored data+Betensky, RA; Rabinowitz, D; Tsiatis, AA+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2001::A local likelihood proportional hazards model for interval censored data+Betensky, RA; Lindsey, JC; Ryan, LM; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JAN 30 2002::AN ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, GEP; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1964::Semiparametric regression analysis for doubly censored data+Cai, T; Cheng, S+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2004::Semiparametric mixed-effects models for clustered failure time data+Cai, T; Cheng, SC; Wei, LJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2002::Hazard regression for interval-censored data with penalized spline+Cai, TX; Betensky, RA+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2003::Semiparametric analysis of transformation models with censored data+Chen, KN; Jin, ZZ; Ying, ZL+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::Analysis of transformation models with censored data+Cheng, SC; Wei, LJ; Ying, Z+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::Predicting survival probabilities with semiparametric transformation models+Cheng, SC; Wei, LJ; Ying, Z+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::RANK REGRESSION+CUZICK, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1988::On the linear transformation model for censored data+Fine, JP; Ying, Z; Wei, LJ+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1998::A PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL FOR INTERVAL-CENSORED FAILURE TIME DATA+FINKELSTEIN, DM+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1986::Asymptotically optimal estimation of smooth functionals for interval censoring, case 2+Geskus, R; Groeneboom, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::Asymptotically optimal estimation of smooth functionals for interval censoring.

Estimating life expectancy of demented and institutionalized subjects from interval-censored observations of a multi-state model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0900900405,DEC 2009,16,6,"We consider the problem of estimating life expectancy of demented and institutionalized subjects from interval-censored observations. A mixed discrete-continuous scheme of observation is a classical pattern in epidemiology because very often clinical status is assessed at discrete visit times while times of death or other events can be exactly observed. In this work, we jointly modelled dementia, institutionalization and death from data of a cohort study. Due to discrete time observations, it may happen that a subject developed dementia or was institutionalized between the last visit and the death. Consequently, there is an uncertainty about the precise number of diseased or institutionalized subjects. Moreover, the time of onset of dementia is interval censored. We use a penalized likelihood approach for estimating the transition intensities of the multi-state model. With these estimators, incidence and life expectancy can be computed easily. This approach deals with incomplete data due to the presence of left truncation and interval censoring. It can be generalized to take explanatory variables into account. We illustrate this approach by applying this model to the analysis of a large cohort study on cerebral ageing.","dementia,institutionalization,interval censoring,life expectancy,multi-state model,penalized likelihood","AGE-SPECIFIC INCIDENCE,PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD APPROACH,BONE-MARROW TRANSPLANTATION,COARSENED OBSERVATIONS,ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE,DEATH","Joly, Pierre@INSERM, U897, F-75654 Paris 13, France@Univ Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, ISPED, Bordeaux, France::Durand, Cecile@Unknow::Helmer, Catherine@INSERM, U897, F-75654 Paris 13, France@Univ Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, ISPED, Bordeaux, France::Commenges, Daniel@INSERM, U897, F-75654 Paris 13, France@Univ Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, ISPED, Bordeaux, France","Joly, Pierre@Unknow::Durand, Cecile@Unknow::Helmer, Catherine@Unknow::Commenges, Daniel@Unknow","Joly, Pierre@E-6499-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4875-7814::HELMER, Catherine@I-6581-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5169-7421","MULTISTATE MODELS IN SURVIVAL ANALYSIS - A STUDY OF NEPHROPATHY AND MORTALITY IN DIABETES+ANDERSEN, PK+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 1988::Multi-state model for dementia, institutionalization, and death+Commenges, D; Joly, P+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+JUN 2004::Likelihood for generally coarsened observations from multistate or counting process models+Commenges, Daniel; Gegout-Petit, Anne+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2007::Choice between semi-parametric estimators of Markov and non-Markov multi-state models from coarsened observations+Commenges, Daniel; Joly, Pierre; Gegout-Petit, Anne; et al.+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2007::no title+Efron, B.; Tibshirani, R.; Tibshirani, R.

"Urn sampling, interval censoring and proportional hazard models: tests and relationships",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0900900406,DEC 2009,8,0,"This paper proposes a new distribution-free statistical method for testing hypotheses about covariates for survival data having simultaneously right-, left- and interval-censored survival times. The new test is motivated by the analogue between urn sampling and the Cox's proportional hazard models. Investigations of the significance levels and power as a function of the proportion of interval-censored observations and interval length show that the test performs well for most censoring situations encountered in practice. Simulation results also suggest that there is negligible loss of power in the practical situation in which the mean interval length for interval-censored observations is less than the mean survival time. This holds even with heavy interval censoring. Comparison with the widely used Mantel's method for comparing two groups shows that the power of the new method appears to be superior. Furthermore, the test is relatively simple to carry out and generalizes to comparing k populations as well as the testing of general linear hypothesis for arbitrary covariates","interval censoring,mid-rank,rank-based tests,time to events,urn sampling",RANK-TESTS,"Zheng, Lu@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Zelen, Marvin@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Zheng, Lu@Harvard University::Zelen, Marvin@Harvard University",not exist,"ON THE CHOICE OF VARIANCE FOR THE LOG RANK TEST+BROWN, M+BIOMETRIKA+1984::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::Um sampling and the proportional hazard model+Davidov, O; Zelen, M+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 1998::Midrank unification of rank tests for exact, tied, and censored data+Hudgens, MG; Satten, GA+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+OCT 2002::RANKING PROCEDURES FOR ARBITRARILY RESTRICTED OBSERVATION+MANTEL, N+BIOMETRICS+1967::Rank-based inference in the proportional hazards model for interval censored data+Satten, GA+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1996::LINEAR RANK-TESTS FOR INTERVAL-CENSORED DATA WITH APPLICATION TO PCB LEVELS IN ADIPOSE-TISSUE OF TRANSFORMER REPAIR WORKERS+SELF, SG; GROSSMAN, EA+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1986::A non-parametric test for interval-censored failure time data with application to AIDS studies+Sun, JG+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 15 1996"

Latent trajectory modelling of multivariate binary data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800900302,OCT 2009,26,5,"Latent trajectory analysis is a form of latent class analysis, where the manifest variables are longitudinal measurements of a single outcome. The latent classes may correspond to either constant increasing or decreasing levels of the outcome over time and describe different severity or course of a disease. Extension to multiple outcomes at each time point allows more accurate determination of classes, with classes based on combination of the outcomes, however requiring models which account for both correlation between outcomes and periods. Three models are described for multiple binary outcomes, observed at each time point: a latent class model where all outcomes are considered independent at all time points, a model incorporating random effects for subject only and one incorporating random effects for subject and period. The methods are applied to data on asthma and allergy symptoms in infants, with symptoms recorded at four time points, and it is shown that the incorporation of subject and period heterogeneity results in lower estimates of the number of latent classes.","latent class,latent trajectory,longitudinal,multilevel,random effects","OUTCOMES,TIME","Beath, Ken J.@Macquarie Univ, Dept Stat, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia::Heller, Gillian Z.@Macquarie Univ, Dept Stat, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia","Beath, Ken J.@Macquarie University::Heller, Gillian Z.@Macquarie University","Beath, Ken@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4536-0603::Heller, Gillian@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1270-1499","no title+BEATH K+RANDOMLCA R PACKAGE+2008::Developmental typology of trajectories to nighttime bladder control: Epidemiologic application of longitudinal latent class analysis+Croudace, TJ; Jarvelin, MR; Wadsworth, MEJ; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAY 1 2003::A STUDY OF HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS OVER TIME, USING LONGITUDINAL LATENT STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS+FINK, P; JENSEN, J; POULSEN, CS+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL MEDICINE+SEP 1993::MODELING TRANSITIONAL AND JOINT MARGINAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN REPEATED CATEGORICAL-DATA+FOLLMANN, D+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 15 1994::How many clusters?

Multinomial-Poisson models subject to inequality constraints,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800900303,OCT 2009,17,6,Lang's Multinomial-Poisson Homogeneous (MPH) models and Homogeneous Linear Predictor (HLP) Multinomial-Poisson models include as special cases many models for contingency table analysis that have been introduced in the effort to overcome well-known limitations of the log-linear models. Here the definitions of MPH and HLP models are extended to include inequality constraints. It is shown that inequality constrained MPH and HLP models are very flexible and rich family of models for contingency table analysis. The inequality constrained hierarchical multinomial marginal models which are an important sub-class of MPH models are also examined.,"constrained statistical inference,generalized odds ratios,marginal models,multinomial-Poisson homogeneous models,multivariate logit models","CONTINGENCY-TABLES,INFERENCE","Cazzaro, Manuela@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Metodi Quantitat Sci Econ & Aziendal, Milan, Italy::Colombi, Roberto@Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz & Metodi Matemat, I-24044 Bergamo, Italy","Cazzaro, Manuela@University of Milano-Bicocca::Colombi, Roberto@University of Bergamo",not exist,"Order-restricted inference for monotone trend alternatives in contingency tables+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 7 1998::Estimation when a parameter is on a boundary+Andrews, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1999::An extended class of marginal link functions for modelling contingency tables by equality and inequality constraints+Bartolucci, Francesco; Colombi, Roberto; Forcina, Antonio+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2007::Marginal models for categorical data+Bergsma, WP; Rudas, T+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2002::no title+CAZZARO M+STAT METHOD APPL+2007::Maximum likelihood inference for log-linear models subject to constraints of double monotone dependence+Cazzaro, M; Colombi, R.+Stat Methods Appl+2006::Marginal regression models for the analysis of positive association of ordinal response variables+Colombi, R; Forcina, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::no title+Cox, DR; Wermuth, N.+Multivariate dependencies+1996::A unified approach to likelihood inference on stochastic orderings in a nonparametric context+Dardanoni, V; Forcina, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1998::MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC-MODELS+GLONEK, GFV; MCCULLAGH, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Multinomial-Poisson homogeneous models for contingency tables+Lang, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2004::Homogeneous linear predictor models for contingency tables+Lang, JB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2005::Statistical analysis of multiple contingency tables.

On the estimation of the misclassification table for finite count data with an application in caries research,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800900201,JUL 2009,23,3,"We look at the correction for misclassification of possibly corrupted finite count data in epidemiological studies. In general, the misclassification probabilities are estimated from a validation study and used to correct for the distortion. However, most often the validation study is quite small implying that the misclassification probabilities are impossible to calculate or estimate with high variability if based on the multinomial distribution. To increase efficiency, we propose an approach based on the fact that to determine a count the examiner needs to evaluate all items that make up that count, called the double binomial (DB) approach. We suggest various extensions of the DB approach which might mimic better the scoring behaviour of the examiner relative to a gold standard. We evaluate the performance of our approach(es) to estimate the misclassification probabilities in comparison to the multinomial approach in an analytical way and in a simulation study. Finally, the practical use of our methods is exemplified on an oral health survey examining. caries experience in 7-year-old Flemish children involving 16 dental examiners.","Count data,logistic regression,misclassification,prevalence,response error","DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS,REGRESSION,MODELS,ERRORS,SIMEX","Lesaffre, Emmanuel@Erasmus MC, Dept Biostat, Rotterdam, Netherlands@Katholieke Univ Leuven, L Biostat, Louvain, Belgium::Kuechenhoff, Helmut@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, Munich, Germany::Mwalili, Samuel M.@Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Nairobi, Kenya::Declerck, Dominique@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Sch Dent, Louvain, Belgium","Lesaffre, Emmanuel@KU Leuven@Erasmus University Rotterdam@Erasmus University Medical Center::Kuechenhoff, Helmut@University of Munich::Mwalili, Samuel M.@Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology::Declerck, Dominique@KU Leuven","Kuchenhoff, Helmut@A-8291-2010::Kuchenhoff, Helmut@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6372-2487","Modeling repeated measures with monotonic ordinal responses and misclassification, with applications to studying maturation+Albert, PS; Hunsberger, SA; Biro, FM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::BIASES IN THE ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS+BEGG, CB+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 1987::no title+Carroll,, R.

Hierarchical dynamic time-to-event models for post-treatment preventive care data on breast cancer survivors,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800900202,JUL 2009,35,2,"This paper considers model ling data arising in post-treatment preventive care settings, where cancer patients who have undergone disease-directed treatment discontinue seeking preventive care services. Clinicians and public health researchers are interested in explaining such behavioural patterns by modelling the time-to-receiving care while accounting for several patient and treatment attributes. A key feature of such data is that a noticeable number of patients would never return for screening, a concept subtly different from censoring, where an individual does not return for screening in the given time frame of the study. Models distinguishing between these two concepts are known as cure rate models and are often preferred for data where a significant part of the population never experienced the endpoint. Building upon recent work on hierarchical cure model framework we propose modelling a sequence of latent events with a piecewise exponential distribution that remedies oversmoothing encountered in existing models with different latent distributions. We investigate simultaneous regression on the cure fraction and the latent event distribution and derive a flexible class of semiparametric cure rate models.","Cure rate models,dynamic survival models,hierarchical models,latent activation schemes,Markov chain Monte Carlo,preventive care data","MIXTURE-MODELS,BAYESIAN MODEL,CO-MORBIDITY,MONTE-CARLO,CURE RATES,TUMOR CURE,FRACTION","Cooner, Freda W.@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Yu, Xinhua@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Banerjee, Sudipto@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Grambsch, Patricia L.@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::McBean, A.

Extended truncated Inverse Gaussian-Poisson model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800900204,JUL 2009,49,6,"The inverse Gaussian-Poisson mixture model is very useful when modelling highly skewed non-negative integer data in fields as diverse as linguistics, ecology, market research, bibliometry, engineering and insurance. When using this statistical model on the frequency of word or species frequency data, one typically truncates its sample space at zero to accommodate for the ignorance about the number of words,or species that are not observed. In this paper, we show that by truncating the sample space of the inverse Gaussian-Poisson model, one is allowed to extend its parameter space and in that way improve its fit when the frequency of one is larger and the right tail is heavier than is allowed by the unextended model. By fitting the extended model to word frequency count data, we find many instances where the maximum likelihood estimates fall in the extension of the parameter space.","Distribution of vocabulary,Poisson mixture,Sichel model,species frequency,stilometry,textual data","FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTION,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,NUMBER,SIZE","Puig, Xavier@Tech Univ Catalonia, Dept Stat & OR, Catalonia, Spain::Ginebra, Josep@Tech Univ Catalonia, Dept Stat & OR, Catalonia, Spain::Perez-Casany, Marta@Tech Univ Catalonia, Dept Appl Math 2, Catalonia, Spain@Tech Univ Catalonia, Dama UPC, Catalonia, Spain","Puig, Xavier@Polytechnic University of Catalonia::Ginebra, Josep@Polytechnic University of Catalonia::Perez-Casany, Marta@Polytechnic University of Catalonia","Ginebra, Josep@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9521-9635","Sample size and informetric model goodness-of-fit outcomes: a search engine log case study+Ajiferuke, Isola; Wolfram, Dietmar; Famoye, Felix+JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE+2006::INFERENCE FOR SICHEL COMPOUND POISSON-DISTRIBUTION+ATKINSON, AC; YEH, L+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1982::no title+Baayen, HR.+Word frequency distributions+2001::Equivalence of truncated count mixture distributions and mixtures of truncated count distributions+Bohning, Dankmar; Kuhnert, Ronny+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2006::YES, THE GIGP REALLY DOES WORK - AND IS WORKABLE+BURRELL, QL; FENTON, MR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE+MAR 1993::no title+CARLSON M+STAT TRANSITION+2002::no title+Chhikara, R.

Modelling zero-inflated spatio-temporal processes,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800900102,APR 2009,21,15,"We consider models for spatio-temporal processes which assume either non-negative values, and often are observed as zero, or discrete values and are also inflated by zeros. Typically, in the first case, the spatial observations are obtained at fixed locations (point-referenced data) over a region D; whereas in the second, the region D is divided into a finite number of regular or irregular subregions (areal level), resulting in observations for each subregion. Our main idea is based on those of zero-inflated models, by assuming that the value observed at locations and time t, Y(t)(s), is a realization of a mixture between a Bernoulli distribution with a probability of success theta(t)(s) and a probability density-function or probability function p(y(t) (s)vertical bar.). For both cases, we include spatio-temporal latent processes in the model to account for the possible extra variation present in the mean structure of theta(t)(s) and/or p(y(t)(s)vertical bar.). In the context of point-referenced data, we model the amount of rainfall over the city of Rio de Janeiro during 75 weeks; whereas in the areal data level case, we consider weekly cases of dengue fever in the city of Rio de Janeiro during the years of 2001-02.","Bayesian paradigm,conditional autoregressive processes,gaussian processes,mixture models,model comparison","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,COUNT DATA,REGRESSION","Fernandes, Marcus V.

Using decomposed household food acquisitions as inputs of a Kinetic Dietary Exposure Model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800900103,APR 2009,33,4,"Foods naturally contain a number of contaminants that may have different and long-term toxic effects. This paper introduces a novel approach for the assessment of such chronic food risk that integrates the pharmakokinetic properties of a given contaminant. The estimation of such a Kinetic Dietary Exposure Model (KDEM) should be based on long-term consumption data which, for the moment, can only be provided by Household Budget Surveys such as the TNS SECODIP panel in France. A semi-parametric model is proposed to decompose a series of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used as inputs of the KDEM. As an illustration, the risk assessment related to the presence of methylmercury in seafoods is revisited using this novel approach.","Household surveys,individualization,linear MIXED model,risk assessment,spline estimation","METHYL MERCURY,INFORMATION,PRODUCTS,TIME,FISH","Allais, Olivier@INRA CORELA, Lab Rech Consommat, F-94205 Ivry, France::Tressou, Jessica@INRA Met Risk, F-75231 Paris 5, France","Allais, Olivier@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)::Tressou, Jessica@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)","Allais, Olivier@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4849-5255","no title+BERTAIL P+MATH BIOSCI IN PRESS+2007::no title+BOIZOT C+PAN DONN TNS SECODIP+2005::Variable selection and function estimation in additive nonparametric regression using a data-based prior - Comment+Brumback, BA; Ruppert, D; Wand, MP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1999::Individual demands from household aggregates: Time and age variation in the composition of diet+Chesher, A+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+SEP-OCT 1998::Diet revealed?: Semiparametric estimation of nutrient intake age relationships+Chesher, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1997::Some properties of likelihood ratio tests in linear mixed models+Crainiceanu, C .

Modelling orientation trajectories,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800900104,APR 2009,20,4,We describe a modelling approach for orientation trajectories. The initial and final orientations of the object are taken as known and the problem of how the object will transition between the endpoints is considered. Orientations are represented as quaternions and mapped to a tangent space. The deviation from the geodesic connecting the endpoints is introduced and called the slerp residual. Modelling the slerp residuals substantially reduces the distortion caused by mapping to the tangent space. Bezier curves are used to compactly model the trajectories and provide a linkage to potential predictors. Data from an experiment to study human motion while reaching to perform a wide variety of grasps are considered. The orientation trajectories of the hand are modelled in several ways resulting in a simple yet interpretable model.,"Bezier curves,functional data analysis,quaternions","STATISTICS,REGRESSION,CURVES","Faraway, Julian J.@Univ Bath, Dept Math Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England::Choe, Su Bang@Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Faraway, Julian J.@University of Bath::Choe, Su Bang@University of Michigan@University of Michigan System","Faraway, Julian@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7308-3084","SPHERICAL REGRESSION+CHANG, T+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1986::no title+CHOE SB+THESIS U MICHIGAN+2006::Interpolating three-dimensional kinematic data using quaternion splines and hermite curves+Coburn, J; Crisco, JJ+JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME+APR 2005::no title+DOWNS T+VECTORCARDIOGRAPHY+1971::ORIENTATION STATISTICS+DOWNS, TD+BIOMETRIKA+1972::Human animation using nonparametric regression+Faraway, J+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2004::no title+FARAWAY J+TECHNOMETRICS+2007::Modelling three-dimensional trajectories by using Bezier curves with application to hand motion+Faraway, Julian J.; Reed, Matthew P.; Wang, Jing+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2007::Practical parameterization of rotations using the exponential map+Grassia, S.+J.

Corresponding time series occur in high-frequency finance when the stocks are traded on a coarse grid. For parameter estimation, we develop an efficient grouped move multigrid Monte Carlo sampler. This sampler is based on a scale transformation group, whose elements operate on the random samples of a certain conditional distribution. Also volatility estimates are provided. For illustration, we apply our new model class to price changes of the IBM stock.

Modelling transport mode decisions using hierarchical logistic regression models with spatial and cluster effects,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800800401,DEC 2008,49,4,"This work is motivated by a mobility study conducted in the city of Munich, Germany. The variable of interest is a binary response, which indicates whether public transport has been utilized or not. One of the central questions is to identify areas of low/high utilization of public transport after M adjusting for explanatory factors such as trip, individual and household attributes. For the spatial effects a modification of a class of Markov random fields (MRF) models with proper joint distributions introduced by Pettitt et al. (2002) is developed. It contains the intrinsic MRF in the limit and allows for efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Further cluster effects using group and individual approaches are taken into consideration. The first one models heterogeneity between clusters, while the second one models heterogeneity within clusters. A naive approach to include individual cluster effects results in an unidentifiable model. It is shown how a re-parametrization gives identifiable parameters. This provides a new approach for modeling heterogeneity within clusters. Finally, the proposed model classes are applied to the mobility study.","binary regression,group and individual cluster effects,MCMC,spatial effects,transport mode decisions","STRUCTURED ADDITIVE REGRESSION,BAYESIAN COMPUTATION,BINARY,CHOICE,SPACE,STATISTICS,POSTERIORS,PROPRIETY,SYSTEMS,CAR","Czado, Claudia@Univ Munich, Ctr Math Sci, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Prokopenko, Sergij@Unknow","Czado, Claudia@University of Munich::Prokopenko, Sergij@Unknow","Czado, Claudia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6329-5438","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::no title+Anselin, L.; Florax, R.+New Directions in Spatial Econometrics+1995::no title+Anselin,, L.+Spatial econometrics: methods and models+1988::no title+no author+Advances in Spatial Econometrics: Methodology, Tools and Applications+2004::no title+Banerjee, Sudipto; Carlin, Bradley P; Gelfand, Alan E.+Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data+2004::no title+Ben-Akiva, M.; Lerman, S.

A time varying hidden Markov model with latent information,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800800402,DEC 2008,33,2,"The time varying hidden Markov models are based on the use of some observable variables, which we suppose to drive the transition probabilities. The estimation of the model is conditional on the availability of this information, which is not obvious. In this paper we propose a time varying hidden Markov model with the transition probabilities driven by a latent variable subject to the same Markovian changes of the dependent variable. The model has a state-space form and the latent variable is estimated using a modified Kim filter, so that this information is always available; furthermore, the estimation of this latent variable is useful to forecast the changes in the state. We show the practical characteristics of this model through an example in which the latent variable is the business cycle.","forecasts,latent variables,Markov switching,signal extraction,state-space","BUSINESS-CYCLE,DURATION DEPENDENCE,SWITCHING MODEL,GNP GROWTH,REGIME,SERIES","Otranto, Edoardo@Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Econ Impresa & Regolamentaz, I-07100 Sassari, Italy","Otranto, Edoardo@University of Sassari",not exist,"Applications of hidden Markov chains in image analysis+Aas, K; Eikvil, L; Huseby, RB+PATTERN RECOGNITION+APR 1999::Detecting homogeneous segments in DNA sequences by using hidden Markov models+Boys, RJ; Henderson, DA; Wilkinson, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2000::no title+CHIB S+FED ST LOUIS WORKING+2004::Regime Switching with Time-Varying Transition Probabilities+Diebold, F.

Sharpening P-spline signal regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800800403,DEC 2008,20,5,"We propose two variations of P-spline signal regression: space-varying penalization signal regression (SPSR) and additive polynomial signal regression (APSR). SPSR uses space-varying roughness penalty according to the estimated coefficients from the partial least-squares (PLS) regression, while APSR expands the linear basis to polynomial bases. SPSR and APSR are motivated in the following two scenarios, respectively: (i) some region(s) of the regressor channels contain more useful information for prediction than others and (ii) the relationship between the response and regressor channels is highly nonlinear. We also extend the methods to the generalized linear regression setting. As illustration, we apply the methods to two published data sets showing highly competitive performance.","multivariate calibration,P-splines,partial least squares","GENERALIZED LINEAR-REGRESSION,MULTIVARIATE CALIBRATION,TEMPERATURE,SPECTRA","Li, Bin@Louisiana State Univ, Dept Expt Stat, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA::Marx, Brian D.@Louisiana State Univ, Dept Expt Stat, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Li, Bin@Louisiana State University@Louisiana State University System::Marx, Brian D.@Louisiana State University@Louisiana State University System",not exist,"OPTIMAL MINIMAL NEURAL INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA+BORGGAARD, C; THODBERG, HH+ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY+MAR 1 1992::no title+De Boor, C.+A Practical Guide to Splines+1978::no title+Dierckx, Paul.+Curve and surface fitting with splines+1995::Multivariate calibration with temperature interaction using two-dimensional penalized signal regression+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+JUN 28 2003::Generalized linear additive smooth structures+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2002::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::A STATISTICAL VIEW OF SOME CHEMOMETRICS REGRESSION TOOLS+FRANK, IE; FRIEDMAN, JH+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1993::Greedy function approximation: A gradient boosting machine+Friedman, JH+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2001::PENALIZED DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS+HASTIE, T; BUJA, A; TIBSHIRANI, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 1995::no title+Hastie, T.

Modelling general patterns of digit preference,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800800404,DEC 2008,26,16,"In many applications data can be interpreted as indirect observations of a latent distribution. A typical example is the phenomenon known as digit preference, i.e. the tendency to round outcomes to pleasing digits. The composite link model (CLM) is a useful framework to uncover such latent distributions. Moreover, when applied to data showing digit preferences, this approach allows estimation of the proportions of counts that were transferred to neighbouring digits. As the estimating equations generally are singular or severely ill-conditioned, we impose smoothness assumptions on the latent distribution and penalize the likelihood function. To estimate the misreported proportions, we use a weighted least-squares regression with an added L(1) penalty. The optimal smoothing parameters are found by minimizing the Akaike's information Criterion (AIC). The approach is verified by a simulation study and several applications are presented.","composite link model,digit preference,L(1) penalty,penalized likelihood,smoothing","BLOOD-PRESSURE-MEASUREMENTS,AGE,ERROR,WEIGHT","Camarda, Carlo G.@Max Planck Inst Demog Res, D-18057 Rostock, Germany::Eilers, Paul H.

Skew random effects in multilevel binomial models: an alternative to nonparametric approach,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800800301,OCT 2008,31,7,"Compared to modelling observable data, it is more difficult to choose a suitable distribution to describe latent variables since no prior knowledge or observable information can be used and only normal or nonparametric distributions are mainly applied to random effects for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) in the literature. To enhance the modelling toolkit, this article investigates a class of parametric skew elliptical random effects in multilevel binomial regression models using a Bayesian approach; the class includes skew normal, skew Students' t-distributions and others. Skewness mechanism is considered through multiplying skewness parameter Delta by standardized folded elliptical random variables, and the posterior sampling is realized by working on a binary skewness indicator (BSI) instead of continuous Delta for parameter identifiability. Simulation study shows that the original continuous skewness parameter Delta and the posterior mean of BSI may have dichotomous signs to describe the directional (right/left) skewness; thus we address the importance of assuming specific random effects distribution and interpreting the skewness carefully. The methodology is exemplified through reanalyzing a teratogenic activity study of two niacin analog's published in the biological literature, and sampling-based model comparison shows that the parametric skew normal random effects model works largely better than nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture models for this data set.","Binomial,binary skewness indicator (BSI),generalized linear mixed model (GLMM),multilevel,random effects,sign switching,skewness","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,BAYESIAN-APPROACH,LONGITUDINAL DATA,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE,SELECTION,PRIORS","Liu, Junfeng@Canc Inst New Jersey, Div Biometr, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA@Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Newark, NJ 07103 USA::Dey, Dipak K.@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Liu, Junfeng@Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey@Rutgers State University Medical Center@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Dey, Dipak K.@University of Connecticut",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS WITH NONPARAMETRIC PRIORS+BUTLER, SM; LOUIS, TA+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT-NOV 1992::Bayesian approach for nonlinear random effects models+Dey, DK; Chen, MH; Chang, H+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1997::A new construction for skew multivariate distributions+Dey, DK; Liu, JF+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2005::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::PREDICTIVE APPROACH TO MODEL SELECTION+GEISSER, S; EDDY, WF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::Model determination using predictive distributions with implementation via sampling-based methods+GELFAND, A.

A comparison of the h-likelihood estimators with the ML estimators is made and its relative merits are discussed.","Generalized linear models,Levy processes,normal inverse Gaussian distribution,likelihood for random-effect models,portfolio selection","INVERSE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY","del Castillo, Joan@Unknow::Lee, Youngjo@Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 151742, South Korea","del Castillo, Joan@Unknow::Lee, Youngjo@Seoul National University","del Castillo, Joan@H-7506-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9169-0120","Non-Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-based models and some of their uses in financial economics+Barndorff-Nielsen, OE; Shephard, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::Modelling by Levy processess for financial econometrics+Barndorff-Nielsen, OE; Shephard, N+LEVY PROCESSES: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+2001::Normal inverse Gaussian distributions and stochastic volatility modelling+BarndorffNielsen, OE+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 1997::Hyperbolic processes in finance+Bibby, BM; Sorensen, M+HANDBOOK OF HEAVY TAILED DISTRIBUTIONS IN FINANCE+2003::Estimation methods for stochastic volatility models: A survey+Broto, C; Ruiz, E+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS+DEC 2004::Hyperbolic distributions in finance+Eberlein, E.; Keller, U.+Bernoulli+1995::Generalized hyperbolic and inverse Gaussian distributions: Limiting cases and approximation of processes+Eberlein, E; Hammerstein, EAV+SEMINAR ON STOCHASTIC ANALYSIS, RANDOM FIELDS AND APPLICATIONS IV+2004::MULTIVARIATE STOCHASTIC VARIANCE MODELS+HARVEY, A; RUIZ, E; SHEPHARD, N+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1994::Stochastic volatility: Likelihood inference and comparison with ARCH models+Kim, S; Shephard, N; Chib, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1998::no title+LEE Y+APPL STAT+2006::Hierarchical generalised linear models: A synthesis of generalised linear models, random-effect models and structured dispersions+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::Hierarchical generalized linear models+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Likelihood for random-effects (with discussion)+Lee, Y.; Nelder, J.

Bayesian inference in STAR models using neighbourhood effects,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800800304,OCT 2008,26,5,"In this paper we propose a semi-parametric Bayesian analysis of a spatio-temporal autoregressive model (STAR) with neighbourhood effects similar to those, of Pace et al.

In addition, the procedure used to obtain the out-sample predictions takes into account the uncertainty associated to the estimation of the model parameters in a more realistic way.

A Bayesian analysis of relative cancer survival with geoadditive models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800800201,JUL 2008,29,4,"In this paper, we develop a so-called relative survival analysis that is used to model the excess risk of a certain sub-population relative to the natural mortality risk which is present in the whole population. Such models are typically used in population-based studies that aim at identifying prognostic factors for disease-specific mortality, with data on specific causes of death not being available. This paper combines relative survival with Bayesian geoadditive regression allowing for a flexible semiparametric analysis. Our work has been motivated by continuous-time spatially referenced survival data on breast cancer where causes of death are not known. A detailed analysis of these data is given.

Simultaneous probability statements for Bayesian P-splines,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800800202,JUL 2008,28,10,"P-splines are a popular approach for fitting nonlinear effects of continuous covariates in semiparametric regression models. Recently, a Bayesian version for P-splines has been developed on the basis of Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques for inference. In this work, we adopt and generalize the concept of Bayesian contour probabilities to additive models with Gaussian or multicategorical responses. More specifically, we aim at computing the maximum credible level (sometimes called Bayesian p-value) for which a particular parameter vector of interest lies within the corresponding highest posterior density (HPD) region. We are particularly interested in parameter vectors that correspond to a constant, linear or, more generally, a polynomial fit. As an alternative to HPD regions, simultaneous credible intervals could be used to define pseudo contour probabilities. Efficient algorithms for computing contour and pseudo contour probabilities are developed. The performance of the approach is assessed through simulation studies. Two applications on the determinants of undernutrition in developing countries and the health status of trees show how contour probabilities may be used in practice to assist the analyst in the model building process.","Bayesian p-values,generalized additive models,MCMC,model choice","REGRESSION,LIKELIHOOD,BINARY,OUTPUT","Brezger, Andreas@Hypovereinsbank Munchen, Munich, Germany::Lang, Stefan@Univ Innsbruck, Dept Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Brezger, Andreas@Unknow::Lang, Stefan@University of Innsbruck","Lang, Stefan@E-7500-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0739-3858","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::BAYESIAN COMPUTATION AND STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS+BESAG, J; GREEN, P; HIGDON, D; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 1995::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Tiao, G.C.+Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis+1973::no title+BREZGER A+BAYESX MANUALS+2005::Generalized structured additive regression based on Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 24 2006::BayesX: Analyzing Bayesian structured additive regression models+Brezger, A; Kneib, T; Lang, S+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+SEP 2005::Marginal likelihood from the Metropolis-Hastings output+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Computing Bayes factors by combining simulation and asymptotic approximations+DiCiccio, TJ; Kass, RE; Raftery, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::no title+EILERS PHC+SPLINES KNOTS PENALT+2004::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Bayesian semiparametric regression analysis of multicategorical time-space data+Fahrmeir, L; Lang, S+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 2001::no title+FAHRMEIR L+J STAT PLAN IN PRESS+no time::no title+Friedman, J.

Bayesian semiparametric multi-state models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800800203,JUL 2008,20,25,"Multi-state models provide a unified framework for the description of the evolution of discrete phenomena in continuous time. One particular example is Markov processes which can be characterised by a set of time-constant transition intensities between the states. In this paper, we will extend such parametric approaches to semiparametric models with flexible transition intensities based on Bayesian versions of penalised splines. The transition intensities will be modelled as smooth functions of time and can further be related to parametric as well as nonparametric covariate effects. Covariates with time-varying effects and frailty terms can be included in addition. Inference will be conducted either fully Bayesian (using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques) or empirically Bayesian (based on a mixed model representation). A counting process representation of semiparametric multi-state models provides the likelihood formula and also forms the basis for model validation via martingale residual processes. As an application, we will consider human sleep data with a discrete set of sleep states such as REM and non-REM phases. In this case, simple parametric approaches are inappropriate since the dynamics underlying human sleep are strongly varying throughout the night and individual-specific variation has to be accounted for using covariate information and frailty terms.","frailties,martingale residuals,multi-state models,penalised splines,time-varying effects,transition intensities","STRUCTURED ADDITIVE REGRESSION,EVENT HISTORY ANALYSIS,LINEAR MIXED MODELS,P-SPLINES,TIME DATA,INFERENCE","Kneib, Thomas@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Hennerfeind, Andrea@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Kneib, Thomas@University of Munich::Hennerfeind, Andrea@University of Munich",not exist,"Dynamic analysis of multivariate failure time data+Aalen, OO; Fosen, J; Weedon-Fekjaer, H; et al.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2004::no title+Andersen, PK; Borgan, O; Gill, RD<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Keiding, N</span>.+Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes+1993::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Generalized structured additive regression based on Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 24 2006::Exact likelihood ratio tests for penalised splines+Crainiceanu, C; Ruppert, D; Claeskens, G; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2005::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::A nonparametric multiplicative hazard model for event history analysis+Fahrmeir, L; Klinger, A+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::no title+FAHRMEIR L+J STAT PLAN IN PRESS+no time::Bayesian inference for generalized additive mixed models based on Markov random field priors+Fahrmeir, L; Lang, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2001::Penalized structured additive regression for space-time data: A Bayesian perspective+Fahrmeir, L; Kneib, T; Lang, S+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2004::no title+FRUHWIRTHSCHNAT.S+STAT COMPUT IN PRESS+no time::Sampling from the posterior distribution in generalized linear mixed models+Gamerman, D+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAR 1997::no title+GREVEN S+J COMPUTATI IN PRESS+no time::no title+HALL P+MARTINGALE LIMIT THE+1980::Geoadditive survival models+Hennerfeind, Andrea; Brezger, Andreas; Fahrmeir, Ludwig+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2006::A mixed model approach for geoadditive hazard regression+Kneib, Thomas; Fahrmeir, Ludwig+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2007::Bayesian P-splines+Lang, S; Brezger, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2004::no title+Ruppert, D; Wand, M.

Model misspecification: finite mixture or homogeneous?,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0800800204,JUL 2008,31,7,"A common problem in statistical modelling is to distinguish between finite mixture distribution and a homogeneous non-mixture distribution. Finite mixture models are widely used in practice and often mixtures of normal densities are indistinguishable from homogenous non-normal densities. This paper illustrates what happens when the EM algorithm for normal mixtures is applied to a distribution that is a homogeneous non-mixture distribution. In particular, a population-based EM algorithm for finite mixtures is introduced and applied directly to density functions instead of sample data. This algorithm is used,to find finite mixture approximations to common homogeneous distributions. An example regarding the nature of a placebo response in drug treated depressed subjects is used to illustrate ideas.","EM algorithm,finite mixture models,placebo response,principal points,skew normal distribution","PRINCIPAL POINTS,CLUSTER ANALYSIS,DISTRIBUTIONS,DEPRESSION,UNIQUENESS","Tarpey, Thaddeus@Wright State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Dayton, OH 45435 USA::Yun, Dong@Wright State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Dayton, OH 45435 USA::Petkova, Eva@NYU, Sch Med, New York, NY 10003 USA","Tarpey, Thaddeus@Wright State University Dayton::Yun, Dong@Wright State University Dayton::Petkova, Eva@New York University","Petkova, Eva@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5129-9442","Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::no title+Azzalini, A.+R package sn: The skew- normal and skew- t distributions (version 0. 4- 2)+2006::Distributional assumptions of growth mixture models: Implications for overextraction of latent trajectory classes+Bauer, DJ; Curran, PJ+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2003::no title+BOX GP+STATISTICS+1979::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::STATISTICS AND THE NATURE OF DEPRESSION+DUNN, G; SHAM, PC; HAND, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1993::BIMODALITY AND THE NATURE OF DEPRESSION+EVERITT, BS+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY+1981::no title+Fang, K.

We focus on the class of species sampling models (SSMs). We critically investigate the common use of the Dirichlet process (DP) prior as a default SSM choice. We discuss alternative prior specifications from a theoretical, computational and data analysis perspective. We conclude with a recommendation to consider SSM priors beyond the special case of the DP prior, and make specific recommendations on how different choices can be used to reflect prior information and how they impact the desired inference.

We build on the recently proposed BEMMA (Bayesian Effects Models for Microarrays) method which is able to model dependence among objects through clustering and then estimates hypothesis-testing parameters averaged over clustering uncertainty. We propose several improvements. First, we separate the clustering of the regression coefficients from the part of the model that accommodates heteroscedasticity. Second, our model accommodates a wider class of experimental designs, such as permitting covariates and not requiring independent sampling. Third, we provide a more satisfactory treatment of nuisance parameters and some hyperparameters. Finally, we do not require the arbitrary designation of a reference treatment. The proposed method is compared in a simulation study to ANOVA and the BEMMA methods.","Bayesian nonparametrics,correlated hypothesis tests,model-based clustering,multiple comparisons","NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,CRITERIA","Dahl, David B.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Mo, Qianxing@Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY USA::Vannucci, Marina@Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA","Dahl, David B.@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System::Mo, Qianxing@Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center::Vannucci, Marina@Rice University",not exist,"MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::BAYESIAN CLUSTER-ANALYSIS+BINDER, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1978::Model-Based Clustering for Expression Data via a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model+Dahl, David B.+BAYESIAN INFERENCE FOR GENE EXPRESSION AND PROTEOMICS+2006::Multiple hypothesis testing by clustering treatment effects+Dahl, David B.; Newton, Michael A.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2007::no title+DAHL DB+J COMPUTATIONA UNPUB+2005::BAYESIAN DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE USING MIXTURES+ESCOBAR, MD; WEST, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF SOME NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::COMPARING PARTITIONS+HUBERT, L; ARABIE, P+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1985::no title+LAU JW+BAYESIAN MODEL BASED+2006::Bayesian mixture model based clustering of replicated microarray data+Medvedovic, M; Yeung, KY; Bumgarner, RE+BIOINFORMATICS+MAY 22 2004::Bayesian infinite mixture model based clustering of gene expression profiles+Medvedovic, M; Sivaganesan, S+BIOINFORMATICS+SEP 2002::A STUDY OF THE COMPARABILITY OF EXTERNAL CRITERIA FOR HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER-ANALYSIS+MILLIGAN, GW; COOPER, MC+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+OCT 1986::Nonparametric Bayesian data analysis+Muller, P; Quintana, FA+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2004::Markov chain sampling methods for Dirichlet process mixture+Neal, RM+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2000::Computational aspects of nonparametric Bayesian analysis with applications to the modeling of multiple binary sequences+Quintana, FA; Newton, MA+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2000::OBJECTIVE CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF CLUSTERING METHODS+RAND, WM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::no title+TIBSHIRANI R+839 CARN MELL U DEP+2006::A unified approach for simultaneous gene clustering and differential expression identification+Yuan, Ming+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2006"
Nonparametric Bayesian modelling for item response,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700800104,APR 2008,26,13,Item response theory is widely used in standardized testing to model the relationship between test takers' unobserved ability levels and their responses to items on the test. Item characteristic curves give the probability of a correct response to an item as a function of ability and are most often modelled with logistic curves. In this paper we demonstrate how to model the item characteristic curve with nonparametric Bayesian methods through the use of Dirichlet process priors and present a complementary model in which the ability distribution is modelled nonparametrically while the item characteristic curves are logistic. We compare the nonparametric models with the two-parameter logistic Bayesian model on data from an exam in an introductory statistics course. We find that the nonparametric curve model produces significantly different item characteristic curves for a few of the items and that the corresponding ability estimates also change substantially for some individuals.,"Dirichlet process,item response theory,latent trait distribution,monotone item response curve",CURVES,"Duncan, Kristin A.@San Diego State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, San Diego, CA 92182 USA::MacEachern, Steven N.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Duncan, Kristin A.@San Diego State University@California State University System::MacEachern, Steven N.@Ohio State University","MacEachern, Steven@A-8692-2009::MacEachern, Steve@C-5299-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4106-1232","BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION OF NORMAL OGIVE ITEM RESPONSE CURVES USING GIBBS SAMPLING+ALBERT, JH+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+FAL 1992::no title+Baker, F.B.; Kim, S.-H.+Item Response Theory+2004::FERGUSON DISTRIBUTIONS VIA POLYA URN SCHEMES+BLACKWELL, D; MACQUEEN, JB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::A semiparametric Bayesian model for randomised block designs+Bush, CA; MacEachern, SN+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1996::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.

Multivariate mixtures of Polya trees for modelling ROC data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700800106,APR 2008,29,16,"Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves provide a graphical measure of diagnostic test accuracy. Because ROC curves are determined using the distributions of diagnostic test outcomes for noninfected and infected populations, there is an increasing trend to develop flexible models for these component distributions. We present methodology for joint nonparametric estimation of several ROC curves from multivariate serologic data. We develop an empirical Bayes approach that allows for arbitrary noninfected and infected component distributions that are modelled using Bayesian multivariate mixtures of finite Polya trees priors. Robust, data-driven inferences for ROC curves and the area under the curve are obtained, and a straightforward method for testing a Dirichlet process versus a more general Polya tree model is presented. Computational challenges can arise when using Polya trees to model large multivariate data sets that exhibit clustering. We discuss and implement practical procedures for addressing these obstacles, which are applied to bivariate data used to evaluate the performances of two ELISA tests for detection of Johne's disease.","Bayesian nonparametrics,diagnostic test evaluation,empirical Bayes","CONDITIONAL DEPENDENCE,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE,TESTS,DIAGNOSIS","Hanson, Timothy E.@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Branscum, Adam J.@Univ Kentucky, Dept Biostat, Lexington, KY 40506 USA@Univ Kentucky, Dept Stat, Lexington, KY 40506 USA@Univ Kentucky, Dept Epidemiol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA::Gardner, Ian A.@Univ Calif Davis, Dept Med & Epidemiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Hanson, Timothy E.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Branscum, Adam J.@University of Kentucky::Gardner, Ian A.@University of California System@University of California Davis","Hanson, Timothy@A-9127-2016","Bayesian and conditional frequentist testing of a parametric model versus nonparametric alternatives+Berger, JO; Guglielmi, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::no title+BRANSCUM AJ+001 U KNET DEP BIOST+2006::Estimation of diagnostic-test sensitivity and specificity through Bayesian modeling+Branscum, AJ; Gardner, IA; Johnson, WO+PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE+MAY 10 2005::Bayesian inferences for receiver operating characteristic curves in the absence of a gold standard+Choi, Young-Ku; Johnson, Wesley O.; Collins, Michael T.; et al.+JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS+JUN 2006::Evaluation of five antibody detection tests for diagnosis of bovine paratuberculosis+Collins, MT; Wells, SJ; Petrini, KR; et al.+CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY IMMUNOLOGY+JUN 2005::Bayesian approaches to modeling the conditional dependence between multiple diagnostic tests+Dendukuri, N; Joseph, L+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2001::Analyzing financial data using Polya trees+Denison, D.; Mallick, B.+Bayesian statistics and its application+2007::A note on the absolute continuity and singularity of Polya tree priors and posteriors+Draghici, L; Ramamoorthi, RV+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2000::Bayesian semi-parametric ROC analysis+Erkanli, Alaattin; Sung, Minje; Costello, E.

Quantile regression for rating teams,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700700402,DEC 2007,11,1,"Quantile regression is proposed for modeling game outcomes and as the basis for rating teams. The model includes the standard location model for team strength as a special case, while allowing for a richer specification in which teams differ according to the quantiles of the outcome distribution. Team ratings are defined as the handicap needed to equalize the outcome of a contest. With teams differing by quantiles, this leads to a class of ratings that depend on where in the outcome distribution the outcome is equalized. Relationships with betting games are discussed. The approach is illustrated by rating National Football League (NFL) teams based on game results for the 2005 season.","handicaps,odds,point spreads,quantile regression,sports ratings",ERRORS,"Bassett, Gilbert W., Jr.@Univ Illinois, Dept Finance, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Bassett, Gilbert W., Jr.@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Chicago Hospital@University of Illinois Chicago",not exist,"Robust sports ratings based on least absolute errors+Bassett, GW+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1997::no title+BASSETT GW+J POLITICAL EC+1981::no title+DAVID HA+METHOD PAIRED COMPAR+1988::A ranking method based on minimizing the number of in-sample errors+Frey, J+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2005::USE OF LINEAR-MODEL METHODOLOGY TO RATE HIGH-SCHOOL OR COLLEGE FOOTBALL TEAMS+HARVILLE, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::REGRESSION QUANTILES+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1978::Quantile regression+Koenker, R; Hallock, KF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+FAL 2001::no title+Koenker, R.+Quantile Regression+2005::A NOTE ON L-ESTIMATES FOR LINEAR-MODELS+KOENKER, R+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+1984::Who's Number 1 in college football? ... and how might we decide?+Stern, H.+Chance+1995::Statistics and the college football championship+Stern, HS+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2004"
A fast and efficient implementation of qualitatively constrained quantile smoothing splines,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700700403,DEC 2007,27,33,"We implement a fast and efficient algorithm to compute qualitatively constrained smoothing and regression splines for quantile regression, exploiting the sparse structure of the design matrices involved in the method. In a previous implementation, the linear program involved was solved using a simplex-like algorithm for quantile smoothing splines. The current implementation uses the Frisch-Newton algorithm, recently described by Koenker and Ng (2005b). It is a variant of the interior-point algorithm proposed by Portnoy and Koenker (1997), which has been shown to outperform the simplex method in many applications. The current R implementation relies on the R package SparseM of Koenker and Ng (2003) which contains a collection of basic linear algebra routines for sparse matrices to exploit the sparse structure of the matrices involved in the linear program to further speed up computation and save memory usage. A small simulation illustrates the superior performance of the new implementation.","interior-point,linear program,nonparametric regression,quantile regression,simplex,smoothing spline","NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,ALGORITHM","Ng, Pin@No Arizona Univ, WA Franke Coll Business, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA::Maechler, Martin@ETH, Seminar Stat, Zurich, Switzerland","Ng, Pin@Northern Arizona University::Maechler, Martin@ETH Zurich","Ng, Pin@A-8684-2009","LINEARLY CONSTRAINED DISCRETE L1 PROBLEMS+BARTELS, RH; CONN, AR+ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE+1980::no title+Becker, R.

Worm plot to diagnose fit in quantile regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700700406,DEC 2007,19,9,"The worm plot is a series of detrended Q-Q plots, split by covariate levels. The worm plot is a diagnostic tool for visualizing how well a statistical model fits the data, for finding locations at which the fit can be improved, and for comparing the fit of different models. This paper shows how the worm plot can be used in conjunction with quantile regression. No parametric distributional assumptions are needed to create the worm plot. We fitted both an LMS and a quantile regression model on Dutch height data. The worm plot shows that the quantile regression model is superior to the LMS model in terms of fit. At the same time, it also contains a warning that the particular quantile model used may actually overfit the data. The resulting quantile curves are wiggly at the extremes, and appear less well suited for drawing growth diagrams. The paper concludes that the worm plot is a natural diagnostic tool for quantile regression.","centiles,growth diagrams,LMS model,P-P plot,Q-Q plot,smoothing","REFERENCE CURVES,CENTILE CURVES,GROWTH,AGE","van Buuren, Stef@TNO Qual Life, Dept Stat, NL-2301 CE Leiden, Netherlands@Univ Utrecht, Fac Social Sci, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","van Buuren, Stef@Utrecht University@Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research","van Buuren, Stef@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1098-2119","Construction of the World Health Organization child growth standards: selection of methods for attained growth curves+Borghi, E; de Onis, M; Garza, C; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JAN 30 2006::FITTING SMOOTHED CENTILE CURVES TO REFERENCE DATA+COLE, TJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1988::SMOOTHING REFERENCE CENTILE CURVES - THE LMS METHOD AND PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD+COLE, TJ; GREEN, PJ+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 1992::Body index measurements in 1996-7 compared with 1980+Fredriks, AM; van Buuren, S; Wit, JM; et al.+ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD+FEB 2000::Continuing positive secular growth change in the Netherlands 1955-1997+Fredriks, AM; Van Buuren, S; Burgmeijer, RJF; et al.+PEDIATRIC RESEARCH+MAR 2000::no title+GANNOUN A+STAT MED+2002::` Reference curves based on non-parametric quantile regression+Gannoun, A; Girard, S; Guinot, C; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT 30 2002::Quantile curves without crossing+He, XM+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1997::Semiparametric estimation of regression quantiles with application to standardizing weight for height and age in US children+Heagerty, PJ; Pepe, MS+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1999::DISTRIBUTION-FREE ESTIMATION OF AGE-RELATED CENTILES+HEALY, MJR; RASBASH, J+ANNALS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY+JAN-FEB 1988::Diagnostics for the exponential normal growth curve model+Kapitula, LR; Bedrick, EJ+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JAN 15 2005::REGRESSION QUANTILES+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1978::Goodness of fit and related inference processes for quantile regression+Koenker, R; Machado, JAF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1999::no title+Koenker, R.+Quantile Regression+2005::Generalized additive models for location, scale and shape+Rigby, RA; Stasinopoulos, DM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2005::Towards evidence based referral criteria for growth monitoring+van Buuren, S; van Dommelen, P; Zandwijken, GRJ; et al.+ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD+APR 1 2004::Worm plot: a simple diagnostic device for modelling growth reference curves+van Buuren, S; Fredriks, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 2001::Quantile regression methods for reference growth charts+Wei, Y; Pere, A; Koenker, R; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 2006::PROBABILITY PLOTTING METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF DATA+WILK, MB; GNANADES.R+BIOMETRIKA+1968"

In doing so, a new double kernel local linear quantile regression estimator is obtained which proves to be consistently superior in performance to the earlier double kernel local linear quantile regression estimator proposed by the authors. It is also straightforward to compute and more readily affords a first derivative estimate.

In this paper, we concentrate on the reproductive behaviour and survival of a small passerine bird, the great tit (Parus major). The dataset we consider is taken from the long-term study of great tits in Wytham Woods in Oxfordshire. The models we consider are designed to relate variation in several phenotypic response variables that are linked to evolutionary fitness, alongside the correlations between them, to both general environmental and individual-specific factors. We fit multivariate cross-classified random effects models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation algorithm described in the paper. Our results show for which traits variability is influenced by environmental factors and for which traits individual bird factors are more important. The partitioning of correlations is particularly illuminating, producing some pairs of 'antagonistic' correlations which are biologically meaningful.","complex data structures,cross-classified models,Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),mixed responses,multilevel modelling","INTEGRATED RECOVERY/RECAPTURE DATA,LATENT VARIABLE MODELS,CLUTCH-SIZE,INDIVIDUAL OPTIMIZATION,INFORMATION,RECOVERY,OUTCOMES,BINARY","Browne, William J.@Univ Bristol, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Bristol BS40 5DU, Avon, England::McCleery, Robin H.@Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 2JD, England::Sheldon, Ben C.@Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 2JD, England::Pettifor, Richard A.@Unknow","Browne, William J.@University of Bristol::McCleery, Robin H.@University of Oxford::Sheldon, Ben C.@University of Oxford::Pettifor, Richard A.@Unknow","Browne, William@A-8686-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6659-6885::Sheldon, Ben@A-8056-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5240-7828","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::The analysis of ring-recovery data using random effects+Barry, SC; Brooks, SP; Catchpole, EA; et al.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2003::The efficient integration of abundance and demographic data+Besbeas, P; Lebreton, JD; Morgan, BJT+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2003::An illustration of the use of reparameterisation methods for improving MCMC efficiency in crossed random effect models+Browne, W.I.+Multilevel Modell.

The parameters can be estimated with iteratively re-weighted linear regression. Unfortunately, the estimating equations generally are singular or severely ill-conditioned. An effective solution is to impose smoothness on the solution, by penalizing the likelihood with a roughness measure. The optimal smoothing parameter is found efficiently by minimizing Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC).

Bayesian model selection for logistic regression with misclassified outcomes,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700700303,OCT 2007,21,14,"We consider the problem of variable selection for logistic regression when the dependent variable is measured imperfectly, under both differential and non-differential misclassification. An MCMC sampling scheme is designed, incorporating uncertainty about which explanatory variables affect the dependent variable and which affect the probability of misclassification. We assume that a small gold standard perfectly measured sample is available to augment the imperfectly measured sample, under the differential misclassification framework. A simulation study illustrates favourable results both in terms of variable selection and parameter estimation. Examples analysing the risk of violence against young women by their partner and the risk of injury in highway motor accidents are considered.","logistic regression,Metropolis Hastings,misclassification,model uncertainty","VARIABLE SELECTION,PREVALENCE,ERRORS,TESTS,RISK","Gerlach, Richard@Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Discipline Econ & Business Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia::Stamey, James@Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA","Gerlach, Richard@University of Sydney::Stamey, James@Baylor University","Stamey, James@A-7204-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3787-6490::Gerlach, Richard@C-3915-2011::Gerlach, Richard@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5656-4556","Estimation of a logistic regression model with mismeasured observations+Chen, KF; Hsueh, HM+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2003::Goodness of fit tests with misclassified data+Cheng, KF; Hsueh, HM; Chien, TH+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1998::IMPLICATIONS OF ERRORS IN SURVEY DATA - A BAYESIAN MODEL+GABA, A; WINKLER, RL+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+JUL 1992::Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models(Comment on an Article by Browne and Draper)+Gelman, Andrew+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Bayesian variable selection in logistic regression: Predicting company earnings direction+Gerlach, R; Bird, R; Hall, A+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2002::no title+GERLACH R+SCH MATH PHYS SCI WO+2004::Case-control analysis with partial knowledge of exposure misclassification probabilities+Gustafson, P; Le, ND; Saskin, R+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2001::no title+GUSTAFSON P+MEASUREMENT ERROR MI+2003::USE OF DOUBLE SAMPLING SCHEMES IN ANALYZING CATEGORICAL DATA WITH MISCLASSIFICATION ERRORS+HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::Risk profiles of adolescent girls who were victims of dating violence+Howard, DE; Wang, MQ+ADOLESCENCE+SPR 2003::BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION OF DISEASE PREVALENCE AND THE PARAMETERS OF DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS IN THE ABSENCE OF A GOLD STANDARD+JOSEPH, L; GYORKOS, TW; COUPAL, L+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+FEB 1 1995::Logistic regression when the outcome is measured with uncertainty+Magder, LS; Hughes, JP+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+JUL 15 1997::Modelling risk when binary outcomes are subject to error+McInturff, P; Johnson, WO; Cowling, D; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 15 2004::Binomial regression with misclassification+Paulino, CD; Soares, P; Neuhaus, J+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2003::Bayesian analysis of misclassified binary data from a matched case-control study with a validation sub-study+Prescott, GJ; Garthwaite, PH+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 15 2005::Double-checking auditors: a Bayesian approach+Raats, VM; Moors, JJA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+2003::Measurement error model for misclassified binary responses+Roy, S; Banerjee, T; Maiti, T+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JAN 30 2005::Nonparametric regression using Bayesian variable selection+Smith, M; Kohn, R+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 1996::DOUBLE SAMPLING SCHEME FOR ESTIMATING FROM BINOMIAL DATA WITH MISCLASSIFICATIONS+TENENBEIN, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1970::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF PREVALENCE FROM THE RESULTS OF SMALL SCREENING SAMPLES+VIANA, MAG; RAMAKRISHNAN, V; LEVY, PS+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1993::no title+WHITTEMORE AS+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1991"
Statistical modelling using product partition models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700700304,OCT 2007,23,2,"Product partition models (PPMs) allow us to partition a set of objects into k sets. PPMs are a special case of Bayesian Partition models. They use partially exchangeable priors where given a partition p of the objects into k sets, the objects in the same set are exchangeable and the objects belonging to distinct sets are independent. PPMs specify prior probabilities for a random partition and update these into posterior distributions of the same form. They provide a convenient way of allowing the data to weight the partitions likely to hold. Posterior estimates of the parameter of interest are obtained by conditioning on the partition and averaging over all generated partitions. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are used to generate partitions of the data. PPMs can be applied to many diverse estimation problems and in this paper we outline two areas where they are useful.","meta-analysis,prediction,product partition models","METAANALYSIS,CANCER","Jordan, Claire@Massey Univ, Inst Informat & Math Sci, Auckland, New Zealand::Livingstone, Vicki@Univ Otago, Dept Prevent & Social Med, Dunedin, New Zealand::Barry, Daniel@Univ Limerick, Dept Math & Stat, Limerick, Ireland","Jordan, Claire@Massey University::Livingstone, Vicki@University of Otago::Barry, Daniel@University of Limerick",not exist,"PRODUCT PARTITION MODELS FOR CHANGE POINT PROBLEMS+BARRY, D; HARTIGAN, JA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1992::no title+Breiman, L.; Friedman, J.

Tobit model estimation and sliced inverse regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700700201,JUL 2007,34,5,"It is not unusual for the response variable in a regression model to be subject to censoring or truncation. Tobit regression models are specific examples of such a situation, where for some observations the observed response is not the actual response, but the censoring value (often zero), and an indicator that censoring (from below) has occurred. It is well-known that the maximum likelihood estimator for such a linear model assuming Gaussian errors is not consistent if the error term is not homoscedastic and normally distributed. In this paper, we consider estimation in the Tobit regression context when homoscedasticity and normality of errors do not hold, as well as when the true response is an unspecified nonlinear function of linear terms, using sliced inverse regression (SIR). The properties of SIR estimation for Tobit models are explored both theoretically and based on extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the SIR estimator is a strong competitor to other Tobit regression estimators, in that it has good properties when the usual linear model assumptions hold, and can be much more effective than other Tobit model estimators when those assumptions break down. An example related to household charitable donations demonstrates the usefulness of the SIR estimator.","dimension reduction,heteroscedasticity,nonnormality,single-index model","SUFFICIENT DIMENSION REDUCTION,LINEAR-REGRESSION,ROBUSTNESS","Li, Lexin@NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA@N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA@Univ Calif Davis, Grad Sch Management, Davis, CA 95616 USA::Simonoff, Jeffrey S.@NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA@N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA@Univ Calif Davis, Grad Sch Management, Davis, CA 95616 USA::Tsai, Chih-Ling@NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA@N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA@Univ Calif Davis, Grad Sch Management, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Li, Lexin@New York University@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina@University of California System@University of California Davis::Simonoff, Jeffrey S.@New York University@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina@University of California System@University of California Davis::Tsai, Chih-Ling@New York University@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina@University of California System@University of California Davis",not exist,"REGRESSION-ANALYSIS WHEN DEPENDENT VARIABLE IS TRUNCATED NORMAL+AMEMIYA, T+ECONOMETRICA+1973::TOBIT MODELS - A SURVEY+AMEMIYA, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1984::AN INVESTIGATION OF THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE TOBIT ESTIMATOR TO NON-NORMALITY+ARABMAZAR, A; SCHMIDT, P+ECONOMETRICA+1982::FURTHER EVIDENCE ON THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE TOBIT ESTIMATOR TO HETEROSKEDASTICITY+ARABMAZAR, A; SCHMIDT, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1981::LINEAR-REGRESSION WITH CENSORED DATA+BUCKLEY, J; JAMES, I+BIOMETRIKA+1979::BINARY REGRESSORS IN DIMENSION REDUCTION MODELS - A NEW LOOK AT TREATMENT COMPARISONS+CARROLL, RJ; LI, KC+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1995::Can SIR be as popular as multiple linear regression?+Chen, CH; Li, KC+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 1998::Three-step censored quantile regression and extramarital affairs+Chernozhukov, V; Hong, H+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2002::Sufficient dimension reduction in regressions with categorical predictors+Chiaromonte, F; Cook, RD; Li, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2002::no title+Cook, R.

"Zero-inflated generalized Poisson models with regression effects on the mean, dispersion and zero-inflation level applied to patent outsourcing rates",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700700202,JUL 2007,29,28,"This paper focuses on an extension of zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) regression models for count data. We discuss generalized Poisson (GP) models where dispersion is modelled by an additional model parameter. Moreover, zero-inflated models, in which overdispersion is assumed to be caused by an excessive number of zeros, are discussed. In addition to ZIGP models considered by several authors, we now allow for regression on the overdispersion and zero-inflation parameters. Consequently, we propose tools for an exploratory data analysis on the dispersion and zero-inflation level. An application dealing with outsourcing of patent filing processes will be used to compare these nonnested models. The model parameters are fitted by maximum likelihood using our R package 'ZIGP' available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Asymptotic normality of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimates in this non-exponential setting is proven. Standard errors are estimated using the asymptotic normality of the estimates. Appropriate exploratory data analysis tools are developed. Also, a model comparison using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) statistics and Vuong tests is carried out. For the given data, our extended ZIGP regression model will,prove to be superior over GP and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models, and even over ZIGP models, with constant overall dispersion and zero-inflation parameters demonstrating the usefulness of our proposed extensions.","maximum likelihood estimator,overdispersion,patent outsourcing,Vuong test,zero-inflated generalized Poisson regression,zero-inflation","COUNT DATA,TESTS","Czado, Claudia@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math Sci, D-85747 Garching, Germany@Univ Munich, Inst Innovat Res Technol Management & Entrepreneu, Munich, Germany::Erhardt, Vinzenz@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math Sci, D-85747 Garching, Germany@Univ Munich, Inst Innovat Res Technol Management & Entrepreneu, Munich, Germany::Min, Aleksey@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math Sci, D-85747 Garching, Germany@Univ Munich, Inst Innovat Res Technol Management & Entrepreneu, Munich, Germany::Wagner, Stefan@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math Sci, D-85747 Garching, Germany@Univ Munich, Inst Innovat Res Technol Management & Entrepreneu, Munich, Germany","Czado, Claudia@Technical University of Munich@University of Munich::Erhardt, Vinzenz@Technical University of Munich@University of Munich::Min, Aleksey@Technical University of Munich@University of Munich::Wagner, Stefan@Technical University of Munich@University of Munich","Wagner, Stefan@E-9598-2010::Czado, Claudia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6329-5438","Firms' use of outside contractors: Theory and evidence+Abraham, KG; Taylor, SK+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JUL 1996::STRATEGIC ASSETS AND ORGANIZATIONAL RENT+AMIT, R; SCHOEMAKER, PJH+STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL+JAN 1993::A rich family of generalized Poisson regression models with applications+Bae, S; Famoye, F; Wulu, JT; et al.+MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION+JUN 20 2005::no title+Consul, P.

Inference for the relative treatment effect with the density ratio model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700700203,JUL 2007,16,5,"Consider the problem of estimating and testing the relative treatment effect between two populations based on a random sample from each distribution. Under the well-established normal theory, inference is based on analysis of variance methods. However, there are many examples of skewed data which show that normal theory is not applicable. Then the problem of inference regarding the treatment effect can be attacked by standard nonparametric methods. In this paper, we propose a serniparametric model, the so-called density ratio model, which specifies that the log-likelihood ratio of two densities is linear in some parameters. For testing hypotheses regarding the relative treatment effect, a robust test is obtained by employing the density ratio model for a suitable Box-Cox transformation of the data. The transformation, along with the density ratio model, are estimated by maximum empirical likelihood. The new test procedure is studied theoretically and it is applied to real and simulated data. It is further compared with some nonparametric competitors, and it is found to have relatively high power across a wide variety of distributions, including those outside the density ratio family.","Box-Cox transformation,empirical likelihood,likelihood ratio test,nonparametric Behrens-Fisher hypothesis,power,simulation",BEHRENS-FISHER PROBLEM,"Fokianos, Konstantinos@NICHHD, Biometry & Math Stat Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA@Univ Cyprus, Dept Math & Stat, Nicosia, Cyprus::Troendle, James F.@NICHHD, Biometry & Math Stat Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA@Univ Cyprus, Dept Math & Stat, Nicosia, Cyprus","Fokianos, Konstantinos@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)@University of Cyprus::Troendle, James F.@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)@University of Cyprus",not exist,"TABLES FOR USE IN COMPARISONS WHOSE ACCURACY INVOLVES 2 VARIANCES, SEPARATELY ESTIMATED+ASPIN, AA+BIOMETRIKA+1949::Resampling methods for the nonparametric Behrens-Fisher problem+Babu, G.

A measure of partial association for generalized estimating equations,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700700204,JUL 2007,12,8,"in a regression setting, the partial correlation coefficient is often used as a measure of 'standardized' partial association between the outcome y and each of the covariates in x' = [x(1),...,xk]. a linear regression model estimated using ordinary least squares, with y as the response, the estimated partial correlation coefficient between y and x(k) can be shown to be a monotone function, denoted f(z), of the Z-statistic for testing if the regression coefficient Of x(k) is 0. When y is non-normal and the data are clustered so that y and x are obtained from each member of a cluster, generalized estimating equations are often used to estimate the regression parameters of the model for y given x. In this paper, when using generalized estimating equations, we propose using the above transformation f (z) of the GEE Z-statistic as a measure of partial association. Further, we also propose a coefficient of determination to measure the strength of association between the outcome variable and all of the covariates. To illustrate the method, we use a longitudinal study of the binary outcome heart toxicity from chemotherapy in children with leukaemia or sarcoma.","coefficient of determination,longitudinal data,repeated measures","REGRESSION,MODELS","Natarajan, Sundar@NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY USA@Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA@Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Gen Internal Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA::Lipsitz, Stuart@NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY USA@Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA@Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Gen Internal Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA::Parzen, Michael@NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY USA@Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA@Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Gen Internal Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA::Lipshultz, Stephen@NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY USA@Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA@Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Gen Internal Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA@Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Natarajan, Sundar@New York University@Emory University@Harvard University@University of Miami::Lipsitz, Stuart@New York University@Emory University@Harvard University@University of Miami::Parzen, Michael@New York University@Emory University@Harvard University@University of Miami::Lipshultz, Stephen@New York University@Emory University@Harvard University@University of Miami",not exist,"no title+no author+Statistics for Social Data Analysis+1994::no title+Christensen, R.+Plane Answers to Complex Questions: The Theory of Linear Models+1996::no title+Cox, D.R.; Snell, D.J.+The Analysis of Binary Data+1989::THE FALLACY OF EMPLOYING STANDARDIZED REGRESSION-COEFFICIENTS AND CORRELATIONS AS MEASURES OF EFFECT+GREENLAND, S; SCHLESSELMAN, JJ; CRIQUI, MH+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+FEB 1986::WALDS TEST AS APPLIED TO HYPOTHESES IN LOGIT ANALYSIS+HAUCK, WW; DONNER, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS USING GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+LIANG, KY; ZEGER, SL+BIOMETRIKA+APR 1986::FEMALE SEX AND HIGHER DRUG DOSE AS RISK-FACTORS FOR LATE CARDIOTOXIC EFFECTS OF DOXORUBICIN THERAPY FOR CHILDHOOD-CANCER+LIPSHULTZ, SE; LIPSITZ, SR; MONE, SM; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+JUN 29 1995::R2 MEASURES BASED ON WALD AND LIKELIHOOD RATIO JOINT SIGNIFICANCE TESTS+MAGEE, L+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1990::A NOTE ON A GENERAL DEFINITION OF THE COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION+NAGELKERKE, NJD+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1991::no title+Neter, J.; Kutner, M.

Modelling spatially correlated survival data for individuals with multiple cancers,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0700700205,JUL 2007,31,6,"Epidemiologists and biostatisticians investigating spatial variation in diseases are often interested in estimating spatial effects in survival data, where patients are monitored until their time to failure (for example, death, relapse). Spatial variation in survival patterns often reveals underlying lurking factors that could assist public health professionals in their decision-making process to identify regions requiring attention. The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute provides a fairly sophisticated platform for exploring novel approaches in modelling cancer survival, particularly with models accounting for spatial clustering and variation. Modelling survival data for patients with multiple cancers poses unique challenges in itself and in capturing the spatial associations of the different cancers. This paper develops the Bayesian hierarchical survival models for capturing spatial patterns within the framework of proportional hazard. Spatial variation is introduced in the form of county-cancer level frailties. The baseline hazard function is modelled serniparametrically using mixtures of beta distributions. We illustrate with data from the SEER database, perform model checking and comparison among competing models, and discuss implementation issues.","Bayesian hierarchical models,frailty models,Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),mixture of beta functions,spatial association,survival modelling",AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS,"Diva, Ulysses@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA@Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Global Biometr Sci, New York, NY 10154 USA::Banerjee, Sudipto@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA@Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Global Biometr Sci, New York, NY 10154 USA::Dey, Dipak K.@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA@Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Global Biometr Sci, New York, NY 10154 USA","Diva, Ulysses@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Connecticut@Bristol-Myers Squibb::Banerjee, Sudipto@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Connecticut@Bristol-Myers Squibb::Dey, Dipak K.@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Connecticut@Bristol-Myers Squibb",not exist,"Slice sampling for simulation based fitting of spatial data models+Agarwal, DK; Gelfand, AE+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2005::Frailty modeling for spatially correlated survival data, with application to infant mortality in Minnesota+Banerjee, S; Wall, MM; Carlin, BP+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2003::Semiparametric spatio-temporal frailty modeling+Banerjee, S; Carlin, BP+ENVIRONMETRICS+AUG 2003::Semiparametric proportional odds models for spatially correlated survival data+Banerjee, S; Dey, DK+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 2005::no title+Banerjee, Sudipto; Carlin, Bradley P; Gelfand, Alan E.+Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data+2004::Non-parametric maximum likelihood estimators for disease mapping+Biggeri, A; Marchi, M; Lagazio, C; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 15 2000::Hierarchical multivariate CAR models for spatio-temporally correlated survival data (with discussion)+Carlin, B.P.; Banerjee, S.+Bayesian Statistics+2003::Deviance Information Criteria for Missing Data Models+Celeux, G.; Forbes, F.; Robert, C.

A paired comparison approach for the analysis of sets of Likert-scale responses,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0600700102,APR 2007,40,28,"This paper provides an alternative methodology for the analysis of a set of Likert responses measured on a common attitudinal scale when the primary focus of interest is on the relative importance of items in the set. The method makes fewer assumptions about the distribution of the responses than the more usual approaches such as comparisons of means, MANOVA or ordinal data methods. The approach transforms the Likert responses into paired comparison responses between the items. The complete multivariate pattern of responses thus produced can be analyzed by an appropriately reformulated paired comparison model. The dependency structure between item responses can also be modelled flexibly. The advantage of this approach is that sets of Likert responses can be analyzed simultaneously within the Generalized Linear Model framework, providing standard likelihood-based inference for model selection. This method is applied to a recent international survey on the importance of environmental problems.","paired comparisons,Bradley-Terry model,response patterns,log-linear model,generalized linear model,GLIM,R Likert scale","LOG-LINEAR APPROACH,OBJECTIVE PROBLEMS,SUBJECTIVE VALUES,CATEGORICAL-DATA,MODELS,DEPENDENCIES","Dittrich, Regina@Vienna Univ Econ, Dept Math & Stat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria@Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England::Francis, Brian@Vienna Univ Econ, Dept Math & Stat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria@Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England::Hatzinger, Reinhold@Vienna Univ Econ, Dept Math & Stat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria@Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England::Katzenbeisser, Walter@Vienna Univ Econ, Dept Math & Stat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria@Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England","Dittrich, Regina@Vienna University of Economics & Business@Lancaster University::Francis, Brian@Vienna University of Economics & Business@Lancaster University::Hatzinger, Reinhold@Vienna University of Economics & Business@Lancaster University::Katzenbeisser, Walter@Vienna University of Economics & Business@Lancaster University","Francis, Brian@A-1953-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7926-9085","Motivation for participation in clinical trials of drugs for the treatment of asthma, seasonal allergic rhinitis, and perennial nonallergic rhinitis+Aby, JS; Pheley, AM; Steinberg, P+ANNALS OF ALLERGY ASTHMA &amp; IMMUNOLOGY+APR 1996::Analysis of ordinal paired comparison data+Agresti, A.+Applied Stat+1992::no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::A hyperbolic cosine latent trait model for unfolding polytomous responses: Reconciling Thurstone and Likert methodologies+Andrich, D+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1996::no title+BARDLEY RA+BIOMETRIKA+1952::Comparative judgments as an alternative to ratings: Identifying the scale origin+Bockenholt, U+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2004::Modeling within-subject dependencies in ordinal paired comparison data+Bockenholt, U; Dillon, WR+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1997::FACTOR AND IDEAL POINT ANALYSIS FOR INTERPERSONALLY INCOMPARABLE DATA+BRADY, HE+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 1989::Objective problems, subjective values, and global environmentalism: Evaluating the postmaterialist argument and challenging a new explanation+Brechin, SR+SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY+DEC 1999::no title+CARRIERE E+UNPUB CROSS NATL STU+2001::A NOTE ON THE QUADRATIC EXPONENTIAL BINARY DISTRIBUTION+COX, DR; WERMUTH, N+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1994::ANALYSIS OF MULTIVARIATE BINARY DATA+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1972::no title+CRITCHLOW DE+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1991::no title+CULP K+J EXTENSION+1999::no title+DALTON R+BRITISH EUROPEAN SOC+1998::ON EXTENDING BRADLEY-TERRY MODEL TO ACCOMMODATE TIES IN PAIRED COMPARISON EXPERIMENTS+DAVIDSON, RR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1970::no title+DENZ H+OSTERREICHISCHE Z SO+2000::Modelling dependencies in paired comparison data - A log-linear approach+Dittrich, R; Hatzinger, R; Katzenbeisser, W+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUL 28 2002::Modelling the effect of subject-specific covariates in paired comparison studies with an application to university rankings+Dittrich, R; Hatzinger, R; Katzenbeisser, W+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1998::A log-linear approach for modelling ordinal paired comparison data on motives to start a PhD programme+Dittrich, R; Hatzinger, R; Katzenbeisser, W+STATISTICAL MODELLING+OCT 2004::no title+Fischer, GH.+Einfuhrung in die Theorie Psychologischer Tests+1974::Analysing partial ranks by using smoothed paired comparison methods: an investigation of value orientation in Europe+Francis, B; Dittrich, R; Hatzinger, R; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2002::no title+Graham, R.

Smoothing the Lee-Carter and Poisson log-bilinear models for mortality forecasting: a penalized log-likelihood approach,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X0600700103,APR 2007,22,39,"Mortality improvements pose a challenge for the planning of public retirement systems as well as for the private life annuities business. For public policy, as well as for the management of financial institutions, it is important to forecast future mortality rates. Standard models for mortality forecasting assume that the force of mortality at age x in calendar year t is of the form exp (alpha(x) + beta K-x(t)). The log of the time series of age-specific death rates is thus expressed as the sum of an age-specific component alpha(x), that is independent of time and another component that is the product of a timevarying parameter Kt reflecting the general level of mortality, and an age-specific component beta(x) that represents how rapidly or slowly mortality at each age varies when the general level of mortality changes. This model is fitted to historical data. The resulting estimated Kt's are then modeled and projected as a stochastic time series using standard Box Jenkins methods. However, the estimated fix's exhibit an irregular pattern in most cases, and this produces irregular projected life tables. This article demonstrates that it is possible to smooth the estimated, beta(x)'s in the Lee-Carter and Poisson log-bilinear models for mortality projection. To this end, a penalized least-squares/maximum likelihood analysis is performed. The optimal value of the smoothing parameter is selected with the help of cross, validation.","cross validation,life table,mortality projection,roughness penalty,smoothing",PROJECTIONS,"Delwarde, Antoine@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Sci Actuarielles, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands::Denuit, Michel@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Sci Actuarielles, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands::Eilers, Paul@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Sci Actuarielles, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Delwarde, Antoine@Universite Catholique Louvain@Universite Catholique Louvain@Leiden University::Denuit, Michel@Universite Catholique Louvain@Universite Catholique Louvain@Leiden University::Eilers, Paul@Universite Catholique Louvain@Universite Catholique Louvain@Leiden University",not exist,"A Poisson log-bilinear regression approach to the construction of projected lifetables+Brouhns, N; Denuit, M; Vermunt, JK+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+DEC 20 2002::Measuring the Longevity Risk in Mortality Projections+BROUHNS, N.+B SWISS ASS ACTUARIE+2002::Smoothing and forecasting mortality rates+Currie, ID; Durban, M; Eilers, PHC+STATISTICAL MODELLING+DEC 2004::Bayesian Poisson log-bilinear mortality projections+Czado, C; Delwarde, A; Denuit, M+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+JUN 24 2005::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::no title+GIROSI F+IN PRESS DEMOGRAPHIC+no time::no title+HENDERSON R+T ACTUARIAL SOC AM+1924::Note on graduation by adjusted average+Henderson, R.+Trans.

Given an agreed structure for the between-subject covariance matrix we use a regression equation approach to model the within-subject covariance matrix. Using an EM algorithm we estimate all of the parameters in the model simultaneously and obtain analytical expressions for the standard errors. By re-analyzing Kenward's (1987) cattle data, we compare our new model with classical menu-selection-based modelling techniques, demonstrating its superiority using the Bayesian Information Criterion. We also conduct a simulation study, which confirms our observational findings. The paper extends our previous covariance modelling work (Pan and MacKenzie, 2003, 2006) to the conditional covariance space of the linear mixed model (LMM).","Cholesky decomposition,conditional covariance,EM algorithm,joint mean-covariance models,linear mixed models,longitudinal data","LONGITUDINAL DATA,EM ALGORITHM,VARIANCE,MATRICES","Pan, Jianxin@Univ Limerick, Ctr Biostat, Limerick, Ireland@Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England::MacKenzie, Gilbert@Univ Limerick, Ctr Biostat, Limerick, Ireland@Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Pan, Jianxin@University of Limerick@University of Manchester::MacKenzie, Gilbert@University of Limerick@University of Manchester",not exist,"no title+ANDERSON TW+ANN STAT+1973::The matrix logarithmic covariance model+Chiu, TYM; Leonard, T; Tsui, KW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::Bayesian analysis of covariance matrices and dynamic models for longitudinal data+Daniels, MJ; Pourahmadi, M+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::Modelling the random effects covariance matrix in longitudinal data+Daniels, MJ; Zhao, YD+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 30 2003::Nonparametric estimation of covariance structure in longitudinal data+Diggle, P.J.; Verbyla, A.P.+Biometrics+1998::no title+Diggle, PJ; Liang, K-Y; Zeger, S.+Analysis of Longitudinal Data+1994::MULTILEVEL TIME-SERIES MODELS WITH APPLICATIONS TO REPEATED-MEASURES DATA+GOLDSTEIN, H; HEALY, MJR; RASBASH, J+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 30 1994::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD APPROACHES TO VARIANCE COMPONENT ESTIMATION AND TO RELATED PROBLEMS+HARVILLE, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::no title+KENWARD MG+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1987::RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS FOR LONGITUDINAL DATA+LAIRD, NM; WARE, JH+BIOMETRICS+1982::NEWTON-RAPHSON AND EM ALGORITHMS FOR LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS FOR REPEATED-MEASURES DATA+LINDSTROM, MJ; BATES, DM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1988::Finding observed information using the EM algorithm+Louis, T.

Models for such processes are important in predicting the behaviour of road junctions. Two-component mixtures have often been used, with a variety of distributions for the components and non-Bayesian methods for fitting. The components are often regarded as representing `free flowing' and `congested' vehicles. We propose a gamma-exponential mixture and compare this with some other models.

Comparing nonparametric surfaces,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082006071848,DEC 2006,23,5,"There is a wide variety of problems where the object of primary interest is a surface. Environmental studies in particular, where data often have a spatial structure, provide many examples where estimation of a surface is a central component of analysis. In these settings, the surfaces are often not well described by simple parametric models. Nonparametric regression therefore offers a convenient means of constructing surface estimates in a straightforward manner. In this paper, the issues associated with comparing such regression surfaces across different groups of data are discussed. Formal methods for assessing the equality of a collection of surfaces, or the suitability of a set of parallel surfaces, are described. These not only extend existing methods of nonparametric analysis of covariance but also allow the commonly occurring case of correlated errors to be incorporated. Graphical methods to provide insight into the sources of departure from a candidate model are also proposed. Several applications are provided to illustrate and explore the proposals.","analysis of covariance,graphical methods,local linear methods,nonparametric regression,quadratic forms,smoothing,spatial data,surface estimation","SMOOTHING PARAMETER SELECTION,REGRESSION-CURVES,COVARIANCE,MODELS","Bowman, Adrian W.@Univ Glasgow, Dept Stat, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Bowman, Adrian W.@University of Glasgow","Bowman, Adrian@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5729-4631","ANCOVA methods for heteroscedastic nonparametric regression models+Akritas, MG; Van Keilegom, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::no title+BOCK M+STAT COMPUTING+2007::no title+Bowman, A.

GLMM approach to study the spatial and temporal evolution of spikes in the small intestine,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082006071851,DEC 2006,37,3,"Mixed models can be applied in a wide range of settings. Probably, they are most commonly used to handle grouping in the data. In addition, mixed models can be used for smoothing purposes as well. When dealing with non-normal data, the use of smoothing methods within the generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) framework is less familiar. We explore the use of GLMM for smoothing purposes in both spatial and longitudinal dimensions. The methodology is illustrated by analysis of spike potentials in the small intestine of different cats. Spatio-temporal models that use two-dimensional smoothing splines across the spatial dimension and random effects to account for the correlations during successive slow-waves are developed. A major advantage of the mixed-model approach is that it can handle smoothing together with grouping (or other types of correlations) in a unified model. In this way, areas with high spike incidence compared with other areas can be detected. Also, the temporal and spatial characteristics of spikes during successive slow-waves can be identified.","gastroenterology,generalized linear mixed models,smoothing splines,spatio-temporal model","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,MIXED MODELS,PENALIZED SPLINES,MULTILEVEL MODELS,BINARY RESPONSES,LIKELIHOOD,REGRESSION","Faes, Christel@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Janssen Pharmaceut, B-2340 Beerse, Belgium@Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Physiol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates::Aerts, Marc@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Janssen Pharmaceut, B-2340 Beerse, Belgium@Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Physiol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates::Geys, Helena@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Janssen Pharmaceut, B-2340 Beerse, Belgium@Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Physiol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates::Bijnens, Luc@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Janssen Pharmaceut, B-2340 Beerse, Belgium@Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Physiol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates::Donck, Luc Ver@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Janssen Pharmaceut, B-2340 Beerse, Belgium@Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Physiol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates::Lammers, Wim J.

We develop a maximum likelihood approach for the parameter estimation of semi-parametric regressions in a mixed model framework. We apply the proposed method to phytoplankton data collected at fixed stations in the Chesapeake Bay, for which chlorophyll data coming from remote sensing are available. A simulation study is also performed. The availability of a variable correlated to the response allows us to achieve a substantial reduction of the prediction error of the expected value of the smoother, without having to specify a nonignorable model.","auxiliary data,correlated data,missing data,Monte Carlo EM algorithm,radial smoother","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,MONTE-CARLO EM,MIXED MODELS,PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS,CHLOROPHYLL-ALPHA,DATA MECHANISM,NONRESPONSE,INFERENCE,VARIABLES,OUTCOMES","Geraci, Marco@Univ S Carolina, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Columbia, SC 29208 USA::Bottai, Matteo@Univ S Carolina, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Geraci, Marco@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina System@University of South Carolina::Bottai, Matteo@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina System@University of South Carolina","Geraci, Marco@B-9588-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6311-8685","REGRESSION-ANALYSIS FOR CATEGORICAL VARIABLES WITH OUTCOME SUBJECT TO NONIGNORABLE NONRESPONSE+BAKER, SG; LAIRD, NM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1988::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics: A comparative review+Cowles, MK; Carlin, BP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::SMOOTHING NOISY DATA WITH SPLINE FUNCTIONS - ESTIMATING THE CORRECT DEGREE OF SMOOTHING BY THE METHOD OF GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION+CRAVEN, P; WAHBA, G+NUMERISCHE MATHEMATIK+1979::RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHLOROPHYLL-A CONCENTRATION AND PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS IN SEVERAL RESERVOIRS IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA+DESORTOVA, B+INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE+1981::The relationship between phytoplankton biovolume and chlorophyll in a deep oligotrophic lake: decoupling in their spatial and temporal maxima+Felip, M; Catalan, J+JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH+JAN 2000::no title+GILKS WR+APPL STAT+1995::Monte Carlo EM for missing covariates in parametric regression models+Ibrahim, JG; Chen, MH; Lipsitz, SR+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1999::Missing responses in generalised linear mixed models when the missing data mechanism is nonignorable+Ibrahim, JG; Chen, MH; Lipsitz, SR+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2001::INCOMPLETE DATA IN GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+IBRAHIM, JG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1990::Missing covariates in generalized linear models when the missing data mechanism is non-ignorable+Ibrahim, JG; Lipsitz, SR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::Using auxiliary data for parameter estimation with non-ignorably missing outcomes+Ibrahim, JG; Lipsitz, SR; Horton, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2001::Some allometric and non-allometric relationships between chlorophyll-alpha and abundance variables of phytoplankton+Kalchev, RK; Beshkova, MB; Boumbarova, CS; et al.+HYDROBIOLOGIA+DEC 27 1996::no title+KAMMANN EE+APPL STAT+2003::Inference in generalized additive mixed models by using smoothing splines+Lin, XH; Zhang, DW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::no title+Little, R.

An incorrect specification of the models for the covariates or for the missingness mechanism may lead to biased inferences for the parameters of interest. Previously published articles either use semi-/non-parametric flexible distributions for the covariates and identify the model via a missing at random assumption, or employ parametric distributions for the covariates and allow a more general non-random missingness mechanism. We consider the analysis of binary responses, combining a missing not at random mechanism with a non-parametric model based on a Dirichlet process mixture for the continuous covariates.

Variable selection in joint modelling of the mean and variance for hierarchical data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13520424,FEB 2015,38,1,"We propose to extend the use of penalized likelihood variable selection to hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs) for jointly modelling the mean and variance structures. We assume a two-level hierarchical data structure, with subjects nested within groups. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is fitted for the mean, with a structured dispersion in the form of a generalized linear model (GLM) for the between-group variation. To do variable selection, we use the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty, which simultaneously shrinks the coefficients of redundant variables to 0 and estimates the coefficients of the remaining important covariates. We run simulation studies and real data analysis for the joint mean-variance models, to assess the performance of the proposed procedure against a similar process which excludes variable selection. The results indicate that our method can successfully identify the zero/non-zero components in our models and can also significantly improve the efficiency of the resulting penalized estimates.","Generalized linear mixed models,H-likelihood,Mean-covariance modelling,Multilevel data,Smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES,ORACLE PROPERTIES,LASSO,MATRIX","Charalambous, Christiana@Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England::Pan, Jianxin@Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England::Tranmer, Mark@Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Charalambous, Christiana@University of Manchester::Pan, Jianxin@University of Manchester::Tranmer, Mark@University of Manchester",not exist,"Statistical modelling of data on teaching styles+Aitkin, M; Anderson, J; Hinde, J.+Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A+1981::STATISTICAL MODELING ISSUES IN SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES+AITKIN, M; LONGFORD, N; PLEWIS, IF; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1986::Joint Variable Selection for Fixed and Random Effects in Linear Mixed-Effects Models+Bondell, Howard D.; Krishna, Arun; Ghosh, Sujit K.+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2010::Heuristics of instability and stabilization in model selection+Breiman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1996::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Bayesian covariance selection in generalized linear mixed models+Cai, B; Dunson, DB+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2006::no title+COX, D.

Simple analysis of non-Markov models: A case study on heart transplant data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14535528,FEB 2015,23,0,"In transplantation studies, often several response measurements are collected for patients while they are on the waiting list. In this settings it is often of primary interest to assess whether the available history of a patient can be used for predicting patient survival as well as further performance on the list. In this work, we use a multi-state model approach to analyze the performance of patients described by their urgency status that changes in time while waiting for a new organ. We use the pseudo-value approach introduced by Andersen et al. (2003) and apply it for the Aalen-Johansen estimator of the state occupation probabilities since the transition probabilities were found to depend on the history. This approach allows us to study the impact of baseline information on the occupation probabilities treating the dependence on the history as a nuisance. It was found that the previous state, the current state and time from the moment of entering the waiting list had an impact on the future performance of the patient. Depending on those, patients were more likely to come back to the particular status in which they were before, die or get a transplant. To address the problem of those competing events, a multinomial approach was used for the next state given the previous state observed.","measurement error correction,Monte Carlo sampling,nonlinear mixed models,survival data","STAGE OCCUPATION PROBABILITIES,INTEGRATED TRANSITION HAZARDS,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,INTERVAL-CENSORED DATA,ILLNESS-DEATH MODEL,COMPETING RISKS,NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION,MULTISTATE PROCESSES,PSEUDO-OBSERVATIONS,EVENT DATA","Murawska, Magdalena@Indiana Univ, Fairbanks Sch Publ Hlth, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA::Rizopoulos, Dimitris@Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Murawska, Magdalena@Indiana University System@Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis::Rizopoulos, Dimitris@Erasmus University Rotterdam",not exist,"EMPIRICAL TRANSITION MATRIX FOR NONHOMOGENEOUS MARKOV-CHAINS BASED ON CENSORED OBSERVATIONS+AALEN, OO; JOHANSEN, S+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1978::Regression analysis for multistate models based on pseudo-value approach with application to bone marrow tranplantation studies+Andersen, P; Klein.+Scandinavian Journal of Statistics+2006::Generalised linear models for correlated pseudo-observations, with applications to multi-state models+Andersen, PK; Klein, JP; Rosthoj, S+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2003::Regression analysis of restricted mean survival time based on pseudo-observations+Andersen, PK; Hansen, MG; Klein, JP+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 2004::no title+Andersen, PK; Borgan, O; Gill, RD<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Keiding, N</span>.+Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes+1993::Likelihood for interval-censored observations from multistate models+Commenges, D.+SORT+2002::A conditional Markov model for clustered progressive multistate processes under incomplete observation+Cook, RJ; Yi, GY; Lee, KA; et al.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2004::Estimation of integrated transition hazards and stage occupation probabilities for non-Markov systems under dependent censoring+Datta, S; Satten, GA+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2002::Validity of the Aalen-Johansen estimators of stage occupation probabilities and Nelson-Aalen estimators of integrated transition hazards for non-Markov models+Datta, S; Satten, GA+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+DEC 15 2001::Nonparametric estimation of stage occupation probabilities in a multistage model with current status data+Datta, Somnath; Sundaram, Rajeshwari+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2006::Robust inference for event probabilities with non-Markov event data+Glidden, DV+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2002::On pseudo-values for regression analysis in competing risks models+Graw, Frederik; Gerds, Thomas A.; Schumacher, Martin+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 2009::THE VALIDITY OF INFERENCES BASED ON INCOMPLETE OBSERVATIONS IN DISEASE STATE MODELS+GRUGER, J; KAY, R; SCHUMACHER, M+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1991::A penalized likelihood approach for an illness-death model with interval-censored data: application to age-specific incidence of dementia+Joly, P; Commenges, D; Helmer, C; et al.+BIOSTATISTICS+SEP 2002::Regression modeling of competing risks data based on pseudovalues of the cumulative incidence function+Klein, JP; Andersen, PK+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2005::Modelling competing risks in cancer studies+Klein, JP+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 30 2006::VARIANCE-ESTIMATION FOR THE JACKKNIFE USING VONMISES EXPANSIONS+KNOTT, M; FRANGOS, CC+BIOMETRIKA+1983::LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS USING GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+LIANG, KY; ZEGER, SL+BIOMETRIKA+APR 1986::Marginal Models for Clustered Time-to-Event Data with Competing Risks Using Pseudovalues+Logan, Brent R.; Zhang, Mei-Jie; Klein, John P.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2011::Nonparametric estimation of transition probabilities in a non-Markov illness-death model+Meira-Machado, Luis; de Una-Alvarez, Jacobo; Cadarso-Suarez, Carmen+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 2006::Direct modelling of regression effects for transition probabilities in multistate models+Scheike, H; Zhang, M.+Scandinavian Journal of Statistics+2007::no title+Shao, J; Tu, D.+The Jackknife and Bootstrap+1995::Analysis of interval-censored data from clustered multistate processes: application to joint damage in psoriatic arthritis+Sutradhar, Rinku; Cook, Richard J.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2008"
State-space models for count time series with excess zeros,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14535530,FEB 2015,35,2,"Count time series are frequently encountered in biomedical, epidemiological and public health applications. In principle, such series may exhibit three distinctive features: overdispersion, zero-inflation and temporal correlation. Developing a modelling framework that is sufficiently general to accommodate all three of these characteristics poses a challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a flexible class of dynamic models in the state-space framework. Certain models that have been previously introduced in the literature may be viewed as special cases of this model class. For parameter estimation, we devise a Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm, where particle filtering and particle smoothing methods are employed to approximate the high-dimensional integrals in the E-step of the algorithm. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we consider an application based on the evaluation of a participatory ergonomics intervention, which is designed to reduce the incidence of workplace injuries among a group of hospital cleaners. The data consists of aggregated monthly counts of work-related injuries that were reported before and after the intervention.","autocorrelation,interrupted time series,intervention analysis,overdispersion,particle methods,state-space models,zero-inflation","INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION,EM ALGORITHM,LIKELIHOOD APPROACH,AUTOREGRESSION","Yang, Ming@Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA::Cavanaugh, Joseph E.@Univ Iowa, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Zamba, Gideon K.

We present the theoretical background and applications to real data together with an alternative criterion for finding the corner automatically.

Oral health research: A source for innovative new statistical developments,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14535479,DEC 2014,48,0,"This article reviews the challenges and opportunities that oral health research may offer to a statistician. To illustrate this, we focus on the Signal Tandmobiel (R) study, a longitudinal oral health survey that triggered many statistical explorations and developments over the last two decades. For example, non-standard distributions are more the rule than the exception in oral health research. In addition, often measurement error problems need to be addressed. The hierarchical structure of the oral health data also poses non-standard challenges. For instance, caries experience in the mouth is spatially correlated with, however, a specific metric defining the distance between two occurrences. In addition, since caries experience in the context of an epidemiological study is only measured at intervals, analysis of survival involves interval-censoring. Finally, when analyzing a realistic data set in oral health, all the above issues may have to be dealt with simultaneously.","agreement measures,caries experience,count data,correlated data,emergence of teeth,interval-censoring,misclassification,multilevel modelling","INTERVAL-CENSORED-DATA,FAILURE TIME MODEL,FLEXIBLE DISTRIBUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS,CARIES EXPERIENCE,TOOTH EMERGENCE,CLINICAL-TRIALS,PERMANENT TEETH,BINARY DATA,MISCLASSIFICATION SIMEX,ERROR DISTRIBUTION","Lesaffre, Emmanuel@Erasmus MC, Dept Biostat, Rotterdam, Netherlands@Katholieke Univ Leuven, L Biostat, Leuven, Belgium::Declerck, Dominique@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Oral Hlth Sci, Leuven, Belgium","Lesaffre, Emmanuel@KU Leuven@Erasmus University Rotterdam@Erasmus University Medical Center::Declerck, Dominique@KU Leuven",not exist,"Assessment of caries experience in epidemiological surveys: a review+Agbaje, J.

A Wald test for zero inflation and deflation for correlated count data from dental caries research,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14535480,DEC 2014,25,0,"Tests of homogeneity in zero-inflated models for count data have been well discussed in the literature, but the existing methodologies have relied primarily on score statistics. An often cited justification for the use of these statistics is that they do not require the model to be fitted under the alternative. But the advent of computer software with robust functions and procedures has made it easy for these alternative models to be fitted routinely in practice. In this article, we exploit this opportunity by using results generated from these analyses to develop a Wald test statistic to evaluate homogeneity in the class of zero-inflated models. We show how the proposed test can be performed with minimal programming effort for the practicing statistician. Technically, the test is based on a reparameterization of the mixing weights that naturally incorporates covariates under heterogeneity, a characteristic often ignored by existing testing procedures. A quasi-likelihood function derived from a working independence model coupled with the so-called sandwich estimator of the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates is used to accommodate correlation in the data. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed Wald test and its real life applications are illustrated using correlated dental caries counts in young children.","dental caries research,Huber sandwich estimator,negative binomial model,Poisson model,two-component mixture models,working independence model,zero inflation and deflation","NEGATIVE BINOMIAL MODELS,SCORE TEST,ESTIMATING EQUATIONS,POISSON REGRESSION,CLUSTERED DATA,ESTIMATOR","Hsu, Wei-Wen@Kansas State Univ, Dept Stat, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA::Todem, David@Michigan State Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA::Kim, KyungMann@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53706 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA::Sohn, Woosung@Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Hlth Serv Res, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Hsu, Wei-Wen@Kansas State University::Todem, David@Michigan State University::Kim, KyungMann@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System::Sohn, Woosung@Boston University",not exist,"Generalized additive modelling and zero inflated count data+Barry, SC; Welsh, AH+ECOLOGICAL MODELLING+NOV 30 2002::The zero-inflated Poisson model and the decayed, missing and filled teeth index in dental epidemiology+Bohning, D; Dietz, E; Schlattmann, P; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1999::On estimation of the Poisson parameter in zero-modified Poisson models+Dietz, E; Bohning, D+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 28 2000::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATES OF THE RELATION BETWEEN WEATHER AND ELECTRICITY SALES+ENGLE, RF; GRANGER, CWJ; RICE, J; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1986::A CAVEAT CONCERNING INDEPENDENCE ESTIMATING EQUATIONS WITH MULTIVARIATE BINARY DATA+FITZMAURICE, GM+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1995::On the so-called ""Huber Sandwich Estimator"" and ""Robust Standard Errors""+Freedman, David A.+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2006::Robust Estimation for Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression+Hall, Daniel B.; Shen, Jing+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2010::Zero-inflated Poisson and binomial regression with random effects: A case study+Hall, DB+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2000::Marginal models for zero inflated clustered data+Hall, DB; Zhang, ZG+STATISTICAL MODELLING+OCT 2004::RANDOM-EFFECTS REGRESSION-MODELS FOR CLUSTERED DATA WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM SMOKING PREVENTION RESEARCH+HEDEKER, D; GIBBONS, RD; FLAY, BR+JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY+AUG 1994::A transition scoring system of caries increment with adjustment of reversals in longitudinal study: evaluation using primary tooth surface data+Ismail, Amid I.; Lim, Sungwoo; Sohn, Woosung+COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+FEB 2011::Score Tests for Extra-Zero Models in Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Models+Jansakul, N.; Hinde, John P.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2009::Semiparametric analysis of zero-inflated count data+Lam, K.

A spatial augmented beta regression model for periodontal proportion data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14535515,DEC 2014,48,1,"Clinical dental research generates large amounts of data with a potentially complex correlation structure from measurements recorded at several sites throughout the mouth. Clinical attachment level (CAL) is one such measure popularly used to assess the periodontal disease (PD) status. We model the proportion of sites for each tooth-type (i.e., incisor, canine, pre-molar and molar) per subject that exhibit moderate to severe PD. Disease free and highly diseased tooth-sites cause these proportion responses to lie in the closed interval [0, 1]. In addition, PD may be spatially referenced, i.e., the disease status of a site is influenced by its neighbours. While beta regression can assess the covariate-response relationship for proportion data, its support in the interval (0, 1) impairs its ability to account for the observed proportions at zero and one. In contrast to ad hoc transformations that confine responses to (0, 1), we develop a framework that augments the beta density with non-zero masses at zero and one while also controlling for spatial referencing. Our approach is Bayesian and is computationally amenable to available software. A simulation study evaluates estimation of regression effects in scenarios of varying sample size, degree of spatial dependence and response transformations. Application to real PD data provide insights into assessing covariate effects on proportion responses.","Augmented beta,Bayesian,conditionally autoregressive (CAR),periodontal disease (PD),proportion data","MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,UNITED-STATES,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,PROJECT SUGAR,DISEASE,POPULATION,RESPONSES,FAMILIES,ZEROS","Parker, Anthony J.@Coll Charleston, Dept Math, Charleston, SC 29424 USA::Bandyopadhyay, Dipankar@Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Slate, Elizabeth H.@Florida State Univ, Dept Stat, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Parker, Anthony J.@College of Charleston::Bandyopadhyay, Dipankar@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Slate, Elizabeth H.@State University System of Florida@Florida State University",not exist,"no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::Destructive periodontal disease in adults 30 years of age and older in the United states, 1988-1994+Albandar, JM; Brunelle, JA; Kingman, A+JOURNAL OF PERIODONTOLOGY+JAN 1999::Periodontal diagnoses and classification of periodontal diseases+Armitage, GC+PERIODONTOLOGY 2000+2004::A spatial beta-binomial model for clustered count data on dental caries+Bandyopadhyay, D; Reich, BJ; Slate, EH.+Stat Methods Med Res+2010::Bayesian modeling of multivariate spatial binary data with applications to dental caries+Bandyopadhyay, Dipankar; Reich, Brian J.; Slate, Elizabeth H.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 10 2009::no title+BANERJEE, S.; CARLIN, B.; GELFAND, A.+Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data+2003::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::Bridging conditional and marginal inference for spatially-referenced binary data+Boehm, L; Reich, BJ; Bandyopadhyay, D.+Biometrics+2013::Bayesian beta regression: Applications to household expenditure data and genetic distance between foot-and-mouth disease viruses+Branscum, Adam J.; Johnson, Wesley O.; Thurmond, Mark C.+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2007::Bayesian methodology for modeling parameters in the two parameter exponential family+Cepeda, C.

"Random forest and variable importance rankings for correlated survival data, with applications to tooth loss",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14535517,DEC 2014,22,2,"Oral health is a significant issue for adults because of its relationship to quality of life, as well as systematic health and well being. Impaired oral health can lead to significant health problems, such as pain and infection. This article considers a tree-based method to assess tooth loss. In particular, a variable importance measure based on extremely randomized trees (Geurts et al., 2006) is proposed for correlated survival data, and is applied to the VA Dental Longitudinal Study. This new variable importance method aims to remove the bias of the traditional random forest variable selection, which may favour input variables with more categories, as shown by Strobl et al. (2007). The multivariate exponential tree algorithm of Fan et al. (2009) is used to build trees, as it has superior prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to marginal and semiparametric frailty model-based trees (Nunn et al., 2011). Simulation studies for assessing various variable importance methods are presented. To limit the final number of meaningful prognostic groups, an amalgamation procedure is used to develop tooth prognostic groups from a forest of trees. The resulting prognosis rules and variable importance rankings may be used in clinical practice to increase tooth retention and establish rational treatment plans. By ranking the relative importance of various clinical and genetic factors for tooth loss, we are able to provide clinicians with critical information so that they can develop and implement an effective treatment plan.","Random forest,variable importance,correlated survival data,prognostic rules,dental applications,VA Dental Longitudinal Study","TREES,REGRESSION,PROGNOSIS,MODELS","Hallett, M.

We compare the two approaches in the context of a Cox regression analysis, where the aim is to estimate the effect of a covariate (e.g., dental treatment) on the risk of failure. Specifically, we treat within-cluster correlation as if it was introduced by unobserved cluster level covariates, and study the small sample behaviour of the marginal and the conditional approach. We show that in a non-randomized setting where an unobserved cluster variable is correlated with the variable of interest, both the marginal and the conditional approaches can give misleading results. We argue that this is an important message, since most often it is assumed that the frailty term and the covariates of interest are independent.","clustered data,marginal model,frailty,attenuation bias,variable selection","SURVIVAL-DATA,FRAILTY,INFERENCE","Eriksson, Frank@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biostat, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark::Gerds, Thomas Alexander@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biostat, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark::Lesaffre, Emmanuel@Erasmus MC, Dept Biostat, Rotterdam, Belgium@Univ Leuven, Sch Publ Hlth, L Biostat, Leuven, Belgium","Eriksson, Frank@University of Copenhagen::Gerds, Thomas Alexander@University of Copenhagen::Lesaffre, Emmanuel@KU Leuven",not exist,"Generating survival times to simulate Cox proportional hazards models+Bender, R; Augustin, T; Blettner, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 2005::EFFECTS OF OMITTING COVARIATES IN COX MODEL FOR SURVIVAL-DATA+BRETAGNOLLE, J; HUBERCAROL, C+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1988::Predicting clustered dental implant survival using frailty methods+Chuang, S. -K.; Cai, T.+JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH+DEC 2006::On functional misspecification of covariates in the Cox regression model+Gerds, TA; Schumacher, M+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2001::no title+Gerds, TA; Qvist, V; Strub, JR<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Pipper, CB; Scheike, T; Keiding, N</span>.+Failure time analysis+2009::Endpoints and survival analysis for successful osseointegration of dental implants+Gerds, TA; Vogeler, M+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+DEC 2005::Modelling clustered survival data from multicentre clinical trials+Glidden, DV; Vittinghoff, E+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 15 2004::Effect of frailty on marginal regression estimates in survival analysis+Henderson, R; Oman, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::ON INFERENCE IN PARAMETRIC SURVIVAL-DATA MODELS+HJORT, NL+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1992::Linear latent variable models: The lava-package+Holst, KK; Budtz-JOrgensen, E.+Computational Statistics+2012::no title+Hougaard, P.+Analysis of Multivariate Survival Data+2000::The design and analysis of split-mouth studies: What statisticians and clinicians should know+Lesaffre, Emmanuel; Philstrom, Bruce; Needleman, Ian; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 10 2009::THE ROBUST INFERENCE FOR THE COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL+LIN, DY; WEI, LJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1989::no title+Martinussen, T; Scheike, TH.+Dynamic Regression Models for Survival Data+2006::Asymptotic theory for the correlated gamma-frailty model+Parner, E+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 1998::Structural equation models: A review with applications to environmental epidemiology+Sanchez, BN; Budtz-Jorgensen, E; Ryan, LM; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2005::MISSPECIFIED PROPORTIONAL HAZARD MODELS+STRUTHERS, CA; KALBFLEISCH, JD+BIOMETRIKA+AUG 1986::Semiparametric transformation models with random effects for clustered failure time data+Zeng, Donglin; Lin, D.

A zero-inflated overdispersed hierarchical Poisson model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14524676,OCT 2014,23,7,"Count data are most commonly modeled using the Poisson model, or by one of its many extensions. Such extensions are needed for a variety of reasons: (1) a hierarchical structure in the data, e.g., due to clustering, the collection of repeated measurements of the outcome, etc.; (2) the occurrence of overdispersion (or underdispersion), meaning that the variability encountered in the data is not equal to the mean, as prescribed by the Poisson distribution; and (3) the occurrence of extra zeros beyond what a Poisson model allows. The first issue is often accommodated through the inclusion of random subject-specific effects. Though not always, one conventionally assumes such random effects to be normally distributed. Overdispersion is often dealt with through a model developed for this purpose, such as, for example, the negative-binomial model for count data. This can be conceived through a random Poisson parameter. Excess zeros are regularly accounted for using so-called zero-inflated models, which combine either a Poisson or negative-binomial model with an atom at zero. The novelty of this article is that it combines all these features. The work builds upon the modelling framework defined by Molenberghs et al. (2010) in which clustering and overdispersion are accommodated for through two separate sets of random effects in a generalized linear model.","Poisson model,clustering,overdispersion,zero-inflation","COUNT DATA,LINEAR MODELS,MIXED MODELS,REGRESSION","Kassahun, Wondwosen@Jimma Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Jimma, Ethiopia::Neyens, Thomas@Hasselt Univ, I BioStat, Hasselt, Belgium::Faes, Christel@KU Leuven Univ Leuven, I BioStat, Leuven, Belgium::Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt Univ, I BioStat, Hasselt, Belgium@KU Leuven Univ Leuven, I BioStat, Leuven, Belgium::Verbeke, Geert@Hasselt Univ, I BioStat, Hasselt, Belgium@KU Leuven Univ Leuven, I BioStat, Leuven, Belgium","Kassahun, Wondwosen@Jimma University::Neyens, Thomas@Hasselt University::Faes, Christel@KU Leuven::Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt University@KU Leuven::Verbeke, Geert@Hasselt University@KU Leuven","Verbeke, Geert@I-5587-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8430-7576::Faes, Christel@E-1384-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1878-9869","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Infant survivorship and occurrence of multiple-births: a longitudinal community-based study, South West Ethiopia+Asefa, M; Tessema, F.+Ethiopian J Health Dev+2002::Negative binomial loglinear mixed models+Booth, JG; Casella, G; Friedl, H; et al.+STATISTICAL MODELLING+OCT 2003::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::EXTRA-POISSON VARIATION IN LOG-LINEAR MODELS+BRESLOW, NE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1984::no title+ENGEL B+STAT NEERL+1994::Topiramate placebo-controlled dose-ranging trial in refractory partial epilepsy using 200-, 400-, and 600-mg daily dosages+Faught, E; Wilder, BJ; Ramsay, RE; et al.+NEUROLOGY+JUN 1996::Accounting for excess zeros and sample selection in Poisson and negative binomial regression models+Greene,, W.+Working Paper EC- 94-10+1994::Overdispersion: Models and estimation+Hinde, J; Demetrio, CGB+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 3 1998::no title+Hinde, J; Demetrio, CGB.+Over-dispersion: Models and Estimation+1998::ZERO-INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION, WITH AN APPLICATION TO DEFECTS IN MANUFACTURING+LAMBERT, D+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::NEGATIVE BINOMIAL AND MIXED POISSON REGRESSION+LAWLESS, JF+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 1987::Multi-level zero-inflated Poisson regression modelling of correlated count data with excess zeros+Lee, AH; Wang, K; Scott, JA; et al.+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+FEB 2006::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::Random effect models for repeated measures of zero-inflated count data+Min, YY; Agresti, A+STATISTICAL MODELLING+MAR 2005::no title+Molenberghs, G.; Verbeke, G.+Models for Discrete Longitudinal Data+2005::An extended random-effects approach to modeling repeated, overdispersed count data+Molenberghs, Geert; Verbeke, Geert; Demetrio, Clarice G.

Sensitivity analysis and calibration of population size estimates obtained with the zero-truncated Poisson regression model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13511168,OCT 2014,16,2,"Zero-truncated regression models for count data can be used to estimate the size of an elusive population. A frequently encountered problem is that the Poisson model underestimates the population size due to unobserved heterogeneity, while the negative binomial model is not identified. A sensitivity analysis using the negative binomial model with fixed dispersion parameter might provide inside in the robustness of the population size estimate against unobserved heterogeneity, but as yet there is no method to determine realistic values for the dispersion parameter. This article introduces an R-squared measure and the use of the Pearson dispersion statistic to alleviate this problem. As a spin-off, a method is proposed for calibration of population size estimates in monitoring studies where the number of covariates varies over the measurement occasions. The performance of these methods is evaluated in simulation studies, and is illustrated on a population of drunk drivers.","capture-recapture,zero-truncation,overdispersion,heterogeneity",,"Cruyff, Maarten J.

A model for overdispersed hierarchical ordinal data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14522910,OCT 2014,27,2,"Non-Gaussian outcomes are frequently modelled using members of the exponential family. In particular, the Bernoulli model for binary data and the Poisson model for count data are well-known. Two reasons for extending this family are (1) the occurrence of overdispersion, implying that the variability in the data is not adequately described by the models, and (2) the incorporation of hierarchical structure in the data. These issues are routinely addressed separately, the first one through overdispersion models, the second one, for example, by means of random effects within the generalized linear mixed models framework. Molenberghs et al. (2007, 2010) introduced a so-called combined model' that simultaneously addresses both. In these and subsequent papers, a lot of attention was given to binary outcomes, counts, and time-to-event responses. While common in practice, ordinal data have not been studied from this angle. In this article, a model for ordinal repeated measures, subject to overdispersion, is formulated. It can be fitted without difficulty using standard statistical software. The model is exemplified using data from an epidemiological study in diabetic patients and using data from a clinical trial in psychiatric patients.","beta distribution,generalized linear mixed model,maximum likelihood,proportional odds model,overdispersion","VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,MIXED MODELS,INFERENCE,TESTS","Ivanova, Anna@KU Leuven Univ Leuven, LStat, Leuven, Belgium@KU Leuven Univ Leuven, I BioStat, Leuven, Belgium::Molenberghs, Geert@KU Leuven Univ Leuven, I BioStat, Leuven, Belgium@Hasselt Univ, I BioStat, Leuven, Belgium::Verbeke, Geert@KU Leuven Univ Leuven, I BioStat, Leuven, Belgium@Hasselt Univ, I BioStat, Leuven, Belgium","Ivanova, Anna@KU Leuven::Molenberghs, Geert@KU Leuven@Hasselt University::Verbeke, Geert@KU Leuven@Hasselt University","Verbeke, Geert@I-5587-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8430-7576","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Negative binomial loglinear mixed models+Booth, JG; Casella, G; Friedl, H; et al.+STATISTICAL MODELLING+OCT 2003::Interdisciplinary diabetes care teams operating on the interface between primary and specialty care are associated with improved outcomes of care: findings from the Leuven Diabetes Project+Borgermans, Liesbeth; Goderis, Geert; Van Den Broeke, Carine; et al.+BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH+OCT 7 2009::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+COX, D.

Quasi-periodic spatiotemporal models of brain activation in single-trial MEG experiments,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14524673,OCT 2014,18,0,"Magneto-encephalography (MEG) is an imaging technique which measures neuronal activity in the brain. Even when a subject is in a resting state, MEG data show characteristic spatial and temporal patterns, resulting from electrical current at specific locations in the brain. The key pattern of interest is a dipole', consisting of two adjacent regions of high and low activation which oscillate over time in an out-of-phase manner. Standard approaches are based on averages over large numbers of trials in order to reduce noise. In contrast, this article addresses the issue of dipole modelling for single trial data, as this is of interest in application areas. There is also clear evidence that the frequency of this oscillation in single trials generally changes over time and so exhibits quasi-periodic rather than periodic behaviour. A framework for the modelling of dipoles is proposed through estimation of a spatiotemporal smooth function constructed as a parametric function of space and a smooth function of time. Quasi-periodic behaviour is expressed in phase functions which are allowed to evolve smoothly over time. The model is fitted in two stages. First, the spatial location of the dipole is identified and the smooth signals characterizing the amplitude functions for each separate pole are estimated. Second, the phase and frequency of the amplitude signals are estimated as smooth functions. The model is applied to data from a real MEG experiment focusing on motor and visual brain processes. In contrast to existing standard approaches, the model allows the variability across trials and subjects to be identified. The nature of this variability is informative about the resting state of the brain.","quasi-periodic,spatiotemporal,p-splines,MEG,magneto-encephalography",,"Ventrucci, Massimo@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy::Bowman, Adrian W.@Univ Glasgow, Sch Math & Stat, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland::Miller, Claire@Univ Glasgow, Sch Math & Stat, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland::Gross, Joachim@Univ Glasgow, Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Ventrucci, Massimo@University of Bologna::Bowman, Adrian W.@University of Glasgow::Miller, Claire@University of Glasgow::Gross, Joachim@University of Glasgow","Gross, Joachim@C-5886-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3994-1006::Bowman, Adrian@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5729-4631","no title+[Anonymous].+R:A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2011::Mapping human brain function with MEG and EEG: methods and validation+Darvas, F; Pantazis, D; Kucukaltun-Yildirim, E; et al.+NEUROIMAGE+2004::no title+De Boor, C.+A Practical Guide to Splines+1978::The Smooth Complex Logarithm and Quasi-Periodic Models+Eilers, Paul H.

Random effects and covariates are allowed for each model parameter, including the changepoint. The method is practical and avoids the computational burdens related to estimation of nonlinear mixed effects models. A conventional linear mixed model with proper covariates that account for the changepoints is the key to our estimating algorithm. We illustrate the method via simulations and using data from a randomized clinical trial focused on change in depressive symptoms over time which characteristically show two separate phases of change.","changepoint,mixed segmented regression,nonlinear mixed models,random changepoints,psychiatric longitudinal data","CHANGE-POINT MODEL,COGNITIVE FUNCTION,THERAPY,DECLINE,GROWTH,SERIES","Muggeo, Vito M.

"A note on adjusted responses, fitted values and residuals in Generalized Linear Models",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13508263,AUG 2014,24,0,"Adjusted responses, adjusted fitted values and adjusted residuals are known to play in Generalized Linear Models the role played in Linear Models by observations, fitted values and ordinary residuals. We think this parallelism, which was widely recognized and used in the early literature on Generalized Linear Models, has been somewhat overlooked in more recent presentations. We revise this parallelism, systematizing and proving some results that are either scattered or not satisfactorily spelled out in the literature. In particular, we formally derive the asymptotic dispersion matrix of the (scaled) adjusted residuals, by proving that in Generalized Linear Models the fitted values are asymptotically uncorrelated with the raw residuals and hence deriving the asymptotic dispersion matrix of these latter residuals. Also, we show that an orthogonal decomposition of the error vector between adjusted response and true linear predictor, parallel to the familiar decomposition in Linear Models, holds approximately. Finally, we provide some new perspective, both in Linear and Generalized Linear Models, on adjusted residuals for model comparison, and their relationships with test-statistics used to compare the fit of nested models.","Generalized Linear Models,adjusted residuals,linear models,Wald test-statistic,Rao score test-statistic","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,REGRESSION-MODELS,DIAGNOSTICS,PLOTS","Lovison, Gianfranco@Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Stat & Matemat, I-90133 Palermo, Italy","Lovison, Gianfranco@University of Palermo - Italy",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, A.

Local sensitivity to non-ignorability in joint models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13504716,JUN 2014,24,4,"This article deals with the analysis of sensitivity to the non-ignorability of the dropout process in joint models (JMs). We investigate the behaviour of the maximum likelihood estimates for the longitudinal process in a neighbourhood of ignorability through the Index of Local Sensitivity to Non Ignorability (ISNI). Some concerns may arise since the ISNI is an absolute measure of change in parameter estimates induced by departures from the MAR assumption; for this reason, we introduce a relative index based on the ratio between the ISNI and a measure of its variability under the MAR assumption, highlighting potential interpretation and drawbacks of this approach. The local sensitivity of the JM and the performance of the relative index are discussed in a simulation study, by varying the number of repeated measurements per individual and the random effect covariance structure. The approach is also applied to a benchmark dataset on Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC).","Joint Models,dropout,ignorability,sensitivity,survival analysis","SHARED-PARAMETER MODELS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,DROP-OUT,SURVIVAL,INDEX","Viviani, Sara@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Stat, I-00185 Rome, Italy::Rizopoulos, Dimitris@Erasmus MC, Dept Biostat, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands::Alfo, Marco@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Stat, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Viviani, Sara@Sapienza University Rome::Rizopoulos, Dimitris@Erasmus University Rotterdam@Erasmus University Medical Center::Alfo, Marco@Sapienza University Rome","Alfo', Marco@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7651-6052","A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::Sensitivity Analysis for Shared-Parameter Models for Incomplete Longitudinal Outcomes+Creemers, An; Hens, Niel; Aerts, Marc; et al.+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+FEB 2010::no title+Diggle, PJ; Liang, K-Y; Zeger, S.+Analysis of Longitudinal Data+1994::Simultaneously modelling censored survival data and repeatedly measured covariates: A Gibbs sampling approach+Faucett, CL; Thomas, DC+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 15 1996::AN APPROXIMATE GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODEL WITH RANDOM EFFECTS FOR INFORMATIVE MISSING DATA+FOLLMANN, D; WU, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1995::INTEGRATION WITH ACCURACY CONTROL+KRONROD, AS+DOKLADY AKADEMII NAUK SSSR+1964::MODELING THE DROP-OUT MECHANISM IN REPEATED-MEASURES STUDIES+LITTLE, RJA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1995::PATTERN-MIXTURE MODELS FOR MULTIVARIATE INCOMPLETE DATA+LITTLE, RJA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::no title+Little, RJA; Rubin, DB.+Statistical Analysis with Missing Data.+2002::An index of local sensitivity to nonignorable drop-out in longitudinal modelling+Ma, GG; Troxel, AB; Heitjan, DF+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 30 2005::no title+Molenberghs, G.; Verbeke, G.+Models for Discrete Longitudinal Data+2005::Primary billiary cirrhosis: Prediction of short term survival based on repeated patient visit+Murtaugh, P; Dickinson, E; Van Dam, G<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Malincho, M; Grambsch, P; Langworthy, A; Gips, C</span>.+Hepatology+2002::JM: An r package for the joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event data+Rizopoulos, D.+Journal of Statistical Software+2010::A two-part joint model for the analysis of survival and longitudinal binary data with excess zeros+Rizopoulos, Dimitris; Verbeke, Geert; Lesaffre, Emmanuel; et al.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2008::Shared parameter models under random effects misspecification+Rizopoulos, Dimitris; Verbeke, Geert; Molenberghs, Geert+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2008::Fully exponential Laplace approximations for the joint modelling of survival and longitudinal data+Rizopoulos, Dimitris; Verbeke, Geert; Lesaffre, Emmanuel+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2009::A Bayesian semiparametric multivariate joint model for multiple longitudinal outcomes and a time-to-event+Rizopoulos, Dimitris; Ghosh, Pulak+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 30 2011::Sensitivity analysis for informative censoring in parametric survival models+Siannis, F; Copas, J; Lu, GB+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2005::A semiparametric likelihood approach to joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data+Song, X; Davidian, M; Tsiatis, AA+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2002::An index of local sensitivity to nonignorability+Troxel, AB; Ma, GG; Heitjan, DF+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2004::An overview of joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data+Tsiatis, A.

Flexible mixture modelling with the polynomial Gaussian cluster-weighted model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13503455,JUN 2014,60,13,"In the context of mixture models with random covariates, this article presents the polynomial Gaussian cluster-weighted model (CWM). It extends the linear Gaussian CWM, for bivariate data, in a twofold way. First, it allows for possible nonlinear dependencies in the mixture components by considering a polynomial regression. Second, it is not restricted to be used for model-based clustering only being contextualized in the most general model-based classification framework. Maximum likelihood parameter estimates are derived using the EM algorithm and model selection is carried out using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the integrated completed likelihood (ICL). The article also investigates the conditions under which the posterior probabilities of component-membership from a polynomial Gaussian CWM coincide with those of other well-established mixture-models which are related to it. When applied to artificial and real data, the polynomial Gaussian CWM has shown to outperform the mixture of polynomial Gaussian regressions, which is its natural competitor in the class of mixture models with fixed covariates.","mixtures of distributions,mixtures of regressions,EM algorithm,polynomial regression,model-based clustering,model-based classification,random covariates,cluster-weighted models","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,MULTIVARIATE T-DISTRIBUTIONS,EM ALGORITHM,FINITE MIXTURES,CONCOMITANT VARIABLES,LINEAR-REGRESSION,DENSITIES,CLASSIFICATION,PARAMETERS,FAMILY","Punzo, Antonio@Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, I-95129 Catania, Italy","Punzo, Antonio@University of Catania","Punzo, Antonio@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7742-1821","no title+Aitken, A.+Proc.

Optimal information in authentication of food and beverages,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13503453,APR 2014,28,0,"Food and beverage authentication is the process by which food or beverages are verified as complying with their label descriptions (Winterhalter, 2007). A common way to deal with an authentication process is to measure attributes, such as, groups of chemical compounds on samples of food, and then use these as input for a classification method. In many applications there may be several types of measurable attributes. An important problem thus consists of determining which of these would provide the best information, in the sense of achieving the highest possible classification accuracy at low cost. We approach the problem under a decision theoretic strategy, by framing it as the selection of an optimal test (Geisser and Johnson, 1992) or as the optimal dichotomization of screening tests variables (Wang and Geisser, 2005), where the 'test' is defined through a classification model applied to different groups of chemical compounds. The proposed methodology is motivated by data consisting of measurements of 19 chemical compounds (Anthocyanins, Organic Acids and Flavonols) on samples of Chilean red wines. The main goal is to determine the combination of chemical compounds that provides the best information for authentication of wine varieties, considering the losses associated to wrong decisions and the cost of the chemical analysis. The proposed methodology performs well on simulated data, where the best combination of responses is known beforehand.","wine,classification,Loss function","MODEL,CLASSIFICATION,VARIABLES","Gutierrez, Luis@Univ Chile, Escuela Salud Publ, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile::Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadist, Fac Matemat, Santiago, Chile","Gutierrez, Luis@Universidad de Chile::Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Universidad  Catolica de Chile",not exist,"Varietal authenticity verification of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Carmenere wines produced in Chile by their anthocyanin, flavonol and shikimic acid profiles.+Baer, D. von; Mardones, C.; Gutierrez, L.; et al.+Bulletin de l'OIV+2005::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::Discrimination with many variables+Brown, PJ; Fearn, T; Haque, MS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1999::Deviance Information Criteria for Missing Data Models+Celeux, G.; Forbes, F.; Robert, C.

"Modelling multivariate, overdispersed binomial data with additive and multiplicative random effects",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13503450,APR 2014,32,3,"When modelling multivariate binomial data, it often occurs that it is necessary to take into consideration both clustering and overdispersion, the former arising from the dependence between data, and the latter due to the additional variability in the data not prescribed by the distribution. If interest lies in accommodating both phenomena at the same time, we can use separate sets of random effects that capture the within-cluster association and the extra variability. In particular, the random effects for overdispersion can be included in the model either additively or multiplicatively. For this purpose, we propose a series of Bayesian hierarchical models that deal simultaneously with both phenomena. The proposed models are applied to bivariate repeated prevalence data for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in injecting drug users in Italy from 1998 to 2007.","Bayesian hierarchical model,binomial data,clustering,overdispersion,MCMC","BAYESIAN MODEL,MIXED MODELS,COUNT DATA,INFERENCE","Del Fava, Emanuele@Hasselt Univ, I BioStat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Bocconi Univ, Carlo F Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam, I-20136 Milan, Italy::Shkedy, Ziv@Hasselt Univ, I BioStat, Diepenbeek, Belgium::Aregay, Mehreteab@Catholic Univ Louvain, I BioStat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt Univ, I BioStat, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Catholic Univ Louvain, I BioStat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Del Fava, Emanuele@Hasselt University@Bocconi University::Shkedy, Ziv@Hasselt University::Aregay, Mehreteab@Universite Catholique Louvain::Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt University@Universite Catholique Louvain","Del Fava, Emanuele@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7352-8525","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::no title+Aitkin, M.+Statistical Inference: an Integrated Bayesian/Likelihood Approach+2010::BAYESIAN MODEL COMPARISON AND MODEL AVERAGING FOR SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION+Aitkin, Murray; Liu, Charles C.; Chadwick, Tom+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2009::Negative binomial loglinear mixed models+Booth, JG; Casella, G; Friedl, H; et al.+STATISTICAL MODELLING+OCT 2003::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::EXTRA-POISSON VARIATION IN LOG-LINEAR MODELS+BRESLOW, NE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1984::MODELING MULTIVARIATE BINARY DATA WITH ALTERNATING LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS+CAREY, V; ZEGER, SL; DIGGLE, P+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1993::Deviance Information Criteria for Missing Data Models+Celeux, G.; Forbes, F.; Robert, C.

In addition one would often like to include covariates to explain variations in the variable of interest.

Regularization and model selection with categorical predictors and effect modifiers in generalized linear models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13503452,APR 2014,30,8,"Varying-coefficient models with categorical effect modifiers are considered within the framework of generalized linear models. We distinguish between nominal and ordinal effect modifiers, and propose adequate Lasso-type regularization techniques that allow for (1) selection of relevant covariates, and (2) identification of coefficient functions that are actually varying with the level of a potentially effect modifying factor. For computation, a penalized iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is presented. We investigate large sample properties of the penalized estimates; in simulation studies, we show that the proposed approaches perform very well for finite samples, too. In addition, the presented methods are compared with alternative procedures, and applied to real-world data.","varying-coefficients,variable selection,generalized linear model,fused Lasso,Categorical predictors","VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,VARIABLE SELECTION,ORACLE PROPERTIES,LONGITUDINAL DATA,LIKELIHOOD,LASSO,SHRINKAGE","Oelker, Margret-Ruth@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-81377 Munich, Germany::Gertheiss, Jan@Univ Gottingen, Dept Anim Sci, Gottingen, Germany::Tutz, Gerhard@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Oelker, Margret-Ruth@University of Munich::Gertheiss, Jan@University of Gottingen::Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich",not exist,"Simultaneous Factor Selection and Collapsing Levels in ANOVA+Bondell, Howard D.; Reich, Brian J.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2009::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::CONSISTENCY AND ASYMPTOTIC NORMALITY OF THE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR IN GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+FAHRMEIR, L; KAUFMANN, H+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1985::Statistical estimation in varying coefficient models+Fan, JQ; Zhang, WY+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 1999::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::SPARSE MODELING OF CATEGORIAL EXPLANATORY VARIABLES+Gertheiss, Jan; Tutz, Gerhard+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+DEC 2010::REGULARIZATION AND MODEL SELECTION WITH CATEGORIAL EFFECT MODIFIERS+Gertheiss, Jan; Tutz, Gerhard+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2012::VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS+HASTIE, T; TIBSHIRANI, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1993::RIDGE REGRESSION - BIASED ESTIMATION FOR NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS+HOERL, AE; KENNARD, RW+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::Variable selection and model choice in structured survival models+Hofner, B; Hothorn, T; Kneib, T.+Computational Statistics+2012::Nonparametric smoothing estimates of time-varying coefficient models with longitudinal data+Hoover, DR; Rice, JA; Wu, CO; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1998::Local likelihood estimation in varying-coefficient models including additive bias correction+Kauermann, G; Tutz, G+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+2000::On the asymptotic performance of median smoothers in image analysis and nonparametric regression+Koch, I+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 1996::A simple approach for varying-coefficient model selection+Leng, Chenlei+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 2009::Component selection and smoothing in multivariate nonparametric regression+Lin, Yi; Zhang, Hao Helen+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2006::Penalized spline estimation for varying-coefficient models+Lu, Yiqiang; Zhang, Riquan; Zhu, Liping+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2008::QUASI-LIKELIHOOD FUNCTIONS+MCCULLAGH, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1983::Consumer perception of boar meat as affected by labelling information, malodorous compounds and sensitivity to androstenone+Meier-Dinkel, Lisa; Trautmann, Johanna; Frieden, Luc; et al.+MEAT SCIENCE+FEB 2013::Different scalding techniques do not affect boar taint+Moerlein, Daniel; Grave, Anne; Sharifi, Ahmad Reza; et al.+MEAT SCIENCE+AUG 2012::no title+Oelker, M. -R.+GVCM.

Asymptotic optimality of Hodges-Lehmann inverse rank likelihood estimators,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13494609,OCT 2013,20,0,"Hodges and Lehmann proposed using rank test statistics evaluated at inversely transformed data to construct estimating equations. This paper reframes the resulting estimates in terms of a rank likelihood. In the context of a model of the form Y = h(e; z, ), where Y is a response, z a vector of predictors and e is a random error, this approach corresponds to computing the inverse e = g(Y, z; ) by solving Y = h(e; z, ) for e and using the distribution of the ranks of independent e's as a likelihood. The properties of the resulting estimators have been developed in many important contexts. This paper will review and extend asymptotic optimality properties of Hodges Lehmann estimators in semiparametric models. In particular, the paper will establish semiparametric optimality of the estimate obtained from a Gaussian linear model. Moreover, it will be shown that the Hodges-Lehmann estimate obtained from the exponential likelihood is asymptotically minimax for the semiparametric accelerated failure time model with increasing hazard rates, and it will be shown that a uniform (Wilcoxon) score estimate applied to log Y-i, 1 i n, is asymptotically minimax for an accelerated failure time model with increasing logit rate.

While properties of the KLD by Wang and Ghosh (2011) have been investigated in the Bayesian framework, this paper further explores the property of this KLD in the frequentist framework using four application examples, each fitted by two competing non-nested models.","comparison of non-nested models,information criterion,Kullback-Leibler divergence","AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR,INFORMATION,IMPACT","Wang, Chen-Pin@Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA::Jo, Booil@Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Wang, Chen-Pin@University of Texas Health San Antonio@University of Texas System::Jo, Booil@Stanford University",not exist,"A New Look at the Statistical Model Identification+Akiake, H.+IEEE Transaction on Automatic Control+1974::EXPECTED INFORMATION AS EXPECTED UTILITY+BERNARDO, JM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::no title+COX, D.

By applying the equivariance of <^></mml:mover> and sigma<mml:mo><^></mml:mover><mml:mo>, the maximum likelihood estimators of mu and Sigma, respectively, we show that the T-2-statistic is invariant under affine transformations. Further, as a consequence of the exact stochastic representation, we derive upper and lower bounds for the cumulative distribution function of the T-2-statistic.

Regression tree-based diagnostics for linear multilevel models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13494612,OCT 2013,28,1,"Longitudinal and clustered data, where multiple observations for individuals are observed, require special models that reflect their hierarchical structure. The most commonly used such model is the linear multilevel model, which combines a linear model for the population-level fixed effects, a linear model for normally distributed individual-level random effects and normally distributed observation-level errors with constant variance. It has the advantage of simplicity of interpretation, but if the assumptions of the model do not hold inferences drawn can be misleading. In this paper, we discuss the use of regression trees that are designed for multilevel data to construct goodness-of-fit tests for this model that can be used to test for nonlinearity of the fixed effects or heteroscedasticity of the errors. Simulations show that the resultant tests are slightly conservative as 0.05 level tests, and have good power to identify explainable model violations (that is, ones that are related to available covariate information in the data). Application of the tests is illustrated on two real datasets.","clustered data,goodness-of-fit test,heteroscedasticity,longitudinal data,nonlinearity","LONGITUDINAL DATA,INFERENCE,VARIANCE","Simonoff, Jeffrey S.@NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA","Simonoff, Jeffrey S.@New York University",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+R:A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2011::no title+Breiman, L.; Friedman, J.

Experimental design in the context of Tikhonov regularized inverse problems,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13494613,OCT 2013,35,4,The method of Tikhonov regularization is commonly used to obtain regularized solutions of ill-posed linear inverse problems.

Bootstrap based Trans-Gaussian Kriging,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13494614,OCT 2013,15,2,"Trans-Gaussian Kriging is a popular method for predicting unobserved values of a nonstationary and non-Gaussian spatial process. However, the predictions generated by Trans-Gaussian Kriging are often biased, primarily because these are produced by applying nonlinear transformations to unbiased optimal predictors of the underlying Gaussian field. The existing approach to bias correction is based on analytical approximations that only alleviate the bias problem partially. In this paper, we formulate a bootstrap method for bias correction and show that under some conditions, it yields asymptotically unbiased predictions. Results from a moderately large simulation show that the proposed method works well in reducing the bias in finite samples. A real data example is also presented illustrating the methodology.","asymptotic unbiasedness,bias correction,log-normal Kriging,non-stationarity,spatial prediction","PREDICTION,TRANSFORMATIONS","Rister, K.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Lahiri, S.

Undesirable optimality results in multiple testing?,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13494615,OCT 2013,17,0,"A number of authors have considered the problem of making multiple comparisons among level-one parameters in multilevel models. This is a setting in which Bayesian procedures have a natural sampling theory interpretation, and where a natural justification for methods that control a directional version of the false discovery rate may be found. However, a basic desirable characteristic of multiple comparison procedures, namely that they should be more conservative than corresponding per-comparison' procedures, appears to be violated by some optimal procedures that have been developed in a multilevel setting. This concern is illustrated in the context of a very simple multilevel model, namely one-way, random-effects analysis of variance.","Analysis of variance,Bayesian decision theory,false discovery rate,multilevel models,multiple comparisons,random effects","FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,DECISION-PROBLEMS,ERROR","Lewis, Charles@Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA::Thayer, Dorothy T.@Unknow","Lewis, Charles@Fordham University::Thayer, Dorothy T.@Unknow",not exist,"CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::A BAYESIAN APPROACH TO MULTIPLE COMPARISONS+DUNCAN, DB+TECHNOMETRICS+1965::Type S error rates for classical and Bayesian single and multiple comparison procedures+Gelman, A; Tuerlinckx, FA+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2000::no title+Hochberg, Y.; Tamhane, A.

Beyond mean regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13494159,AUG 2013,48,24,"Usual exponential family regression models focus on only one designated quantity of the response distribution, namely the mean. While this entails easy interpretation of the estimated regression effects, it may often lead to incomplete analyses when more complex relationships are indeed present and also bears the risk of false conclusions about the significance/importance of covariates. We will therefore give an overview on extended types of regression models that allows us to go beyond mean regression. More specifically, we will consider generalized additive models for location, scale and shape as well as semiparametric quantile and expectile regression. We will review the basic properties of all three approaches and compare them with respect to the flexibility in terms of the supported types of predictor specification, the availability of software and the support for different types of inferential procedures. The considered model classes are illustrated using a data set on rents for flats in the City of Munich.","expectile regression,generalized additive models for location,scale and shape,quantile regression,semiparametric regression","STRUCTURED ADDITIVE REGRESSION,BAYESIAN QUANTILE REGRESSION,VARIABLE SELECTION,MODELS,REGULARIZATION,INFERENCE,SPLINES,CURVES,RISK","Kneib, Thomas@Univ Gottingen, Chair Stat, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Kneib, Thomas@University of Gottingen",not exist,"no title+Belitz, C.; Brezger, A.; Kneib, T.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lang, S.; Umlauf, N</span>.+BayesX: Software for Bayesian Inference in Structured Additive Regression Models+2012::Generalized structured additive regression based on Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 24 2006::Boosting algorithms: Regularization, prediction and model fitting+Buehlmann, Peter; Hothorn, Torsten+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2007::Variable selection and model averaging in semiparametric overdispersed generalized linear models+Cottet, Remy; Kohn, Robert J.; Nott, David J.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2008::Non-crossing non-parametric estimates of quantile curves+Dette, Holger; Volgushev, Stanislav+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2008::Randomized quintile residuals+Dunn, P.

Discussion: A comparison of GAMLSS with quantile regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13494316,AUG 2013,27,5,"A discussion on the relative merits of quantile, expectile and GAMLSS regression models is given. We contrast the complete distribution models' provided by GAMLSS to the distribution free models' provided by quantile (and expectile) regression. We argue that in general, a flexibility parametric distribution assumption has several advantages allowing possible focusing on specific aspects of the data, model comparison and model diagnostics. A new method for concentrating only on the tail of the distributions is suggested combining quantile regression and GAMLSS.","GAMLSS,quantile and expectile regression,regression on the tail of the distribution","CENTILE CURVES,MODELS,HETEROSCEDASTICITY,LIKELIHOOD,VARIANCE","Rigby, R.

A joint survival-longitudinal modelling approach for the dynamic prediction of rehospitalization in telemonitored chronic heart failure patients,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13478880,JUN 2013,26,7,"Telemonitoring in chronic heart failure involves remote monitoring, by clinicians, of daily patient measurements of biomarkers, such as blood pressure and heart rate. As a strategy in heart failure management, the aim is for clinicians to use these measurements to predict rehospitalization, so that intervention decisions can be made. This is important for clinical practice since heart failure patients have a very high rehospitalization rate. We present a dynamic prediction approach, based on calculating dynamically-updated patient-specific conditional survival probabilities, and their confidence intervals, from a joint model for the time-to-rehospitalization and the time-varying and possibly error-contaminated biomarker. We quantify the ability of the biomarker to discriminate between patients who are and those who are not going to get rehospitalized within a given time window of interest. This approach does not only provide a sound statistical modelling approach to the substantive problem, a problem which to the best of our knowledge has not previously been addressed using a statistical modelling approach, it also provides clinicians with a valuable additional tool on which to base their intervention decisions, and thus provides immense contribution to heart failure management.","area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC),dynamic discriminative index,dynamic prediction,joint modelling","PROSTATE-CANCER,CD4 COUNTS,AIDS,HOSPITALIZATION,ACCURACY,TIMES","Njagi, Edmund Njeru@Univ Hasselt, I BioStat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Rizopoulos, Dimitris@Erasmus Univ, Dept Biostat, Med Ctr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands::Molenberghs, Geert@Univ Hasselt, I BioStat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium::Dendale, Paul@Jessa Hosp, Heart Ctr Hasselt, Hasselt, Belgium@Univ Hasselt, Fac Med & Life Sci, Diepenbeek, Belgium::Willekens, Koen@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Med, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Njagi, Edmund Njeru@Hasselt University::Rizopoulos, Dimitris@Erasmus University Rotterdam::Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt University@KU Leuven::Dendale, Paul@Hasselt University::Willekens, Koen@KU Leuven",not exist,"A time-dependent discrimination index for survival data+Antolini, L; Boracchi, P; Biganzoli, E+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2005::Patterns of weight change preceding hospitalization for heart failure+Chaudhry, Sarwat I.; Wang, Yongfei; Concato, John; et al.+CIRCULATION+OCT 2 2007::Correlates of early hospital readmission or death in patients with congestive heart failure+Chin, MH; Goldman, L+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY+JUN 15 1997::MODELING PROGRESSION OF CD4-LYMPHOCYTE COUNT AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO SURVIVAL-TIME+DEGRUTTOLA, V; TU, XM+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1994::Effect of a telemonitoring-facilitated collaboration between general practitioner and heart failure clinic on mortality and rehospitalization rates in severe heart failure: the TEMA-HF 1 (TElemonitoring in the MAnagement of Heart Failure) study+Dendale, Paul; De Keulenaer, Gilles; Troisfontaines, Pierre; et al.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEART FAILURE+MAR 2012::Simultaneously modelling censored survival data and repeatedly measured covariates: A Gibbs sampling approach+Faucett, CL; Thomas, DC+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 15 1996::Multivariable prognostic models: Issues in developing models, evaluating assumptions and adequacy, and measuring and reducing errors+Harrell, FE; Lee, KL; Mark, DB+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 28 1996::Survival model predictive accuracy and ROC curves+Heagerty, PJ; Zheng, YY+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2005::Joint modelling of longitudinal measurements and event time data.+Henderson, R; Diggle, P; Dobson, A+Biostatistics (Oxford, England)+2000-Dec::Increasing efficiency from censored survival data by using random effects to model longitudinal covariates.+Hogan, J W; Laird, N M+Statistical methods in medical research+1998-Mar::Mixture models for the joint distribution of repeated measures and event times+Hogan, JW; Laird, NM+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JAN 15 1997::Models for empirical Bayes estimators of longitudinal CD4 counts+Lavalley, MP; Degruttola, V+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 15 1996::Clinical deterioration in established heart failure: What is the value of BNP and weight gain in aiding diagnosis?+Lewin, J; Ledwidge, M; O'Loughlin, C; et al.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEART FAILURE+OCT 2005::MODELING DISEASE MARKER PROCESSES IN AIDS+PAWITAN, Y; SELF, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data: With Applications in R+Rizopoulos, D+JOINT MODELS FOR LONGITUDINAL AND TIME-TO-EVENT DATA: WITH APPLICATIONS IN R+2012::no title+Rizopoulos, D.+Package JM: R package+2012::Dynamic Predictions and Prospective Accuracy in Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data+Rizopoulos, Dimitris+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2011::A STOCHASTIC-MODEL FOR ANALYSIS OF LONGITUDINAL AIDS DATA+TAYLOR, JMG; CUMBERLAND, WG; SY, JP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1994::MODELING THE RELATIONSHIP OF SURVIVAL TO LONGITUDINAL DATA MEASURED WITH ERROR - APPLICATIONS TO SURVIVAL AND CD4 COUNTS IN PATIENTS WITH AIDS+TSIATIS, AA; DEGRUTTOLA, V; WULFSOHN, MS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1995::Joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data: An overview+Tsiatis, AA; Davidian, M+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2004::Random Effects Models for Longitudinal Data+Verbeke, Geert; Molenberghs, Geert; Rizopoulos, Dimitris+LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH WITH LATENT VARIABLES+2010::Joint analysis of longitudinal data comprising repeated measures and times to events+Xu, J; Zeger, SL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2001::Individual prediction in prostate cancer studies using a joint longitudinal survival-cure model+Yu, Menggang; Taylor, Jeremy M.

Bayesian semiparametric additive quantile regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13480650,JUN 2013,39,22,"Quantile regression provides a convenient framework for analyzing the impact of covariates on the complete conditional distribution of a response variable instead of only the mean. While frequentist treatments of quantile regression are typically completely nonparametric, a Bayesian formulation relies on assuming the asymmetric Laplace distribution as auxiliary error distribution that yields posterior modes equivalent to frequentist estimates. In this paper, we utilize a location-scale mixture of normals representation of the asymmetric Laplace distribution to transfer different flexible modelling concepts from Gaussian mean regression to Bayesian semiparametric quantile regression. In particular, we will consider high-dimensional geoadditive models comprising LASSO regularization priors and mixed models with potentially non-normal random effects distribution modeled via a Dirichlet process mixture. These extensions are illustrated using two large-scale applications on net rents in Munich and longitudinal measurements on obesity among children. The impact of the likelihood misspecification that underlies the Bayesian formulation of quantile regression is studied in terms of simulations.","Quantile Regression,Geodditive Regression,MCMC,LASSO Regularization,Dirichlet Process","VARIABLE SELECTION,MODELS,LASSO,SPLINES,REGULARIZATION,SHRINKAGE","Waldmann, Elisabeth@Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Gottingen, Germany::Kneib, Thomas@Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Gottingen, Germany::Yue, Yu Ryan@CUNY, Zicklin Sch Business, Baruch Coll, New York, NY USA::Lang, Stefan@Univ Innsbruck, Dept Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria::Flexeder, Claudia@HelmholtzZentrum Munchen, Inst Epidemiol 1, Munich, Germany","Waldmann, Elisabeth@University of Gottingen::Kneib, Thomas@University of Gottingen::Yue, Yu Ryan@Baruch College (CUNY)@City University of New York (CUNY) System::Lang, Stefan@University of Innsbruck::Flexeder, Claudia@Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health@Helmholtz Association","Lang, Stefan@E-7500-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0739-3858","Conjugate priors and variable selection for Bayesian quantile regression+Alhamzawi, R; Yu, K.+CONJUGATE PRIORS VAR+2013::Bayesian adaptive Lasso quantile regression+Alhamzawi, Rahim; Yu, Keming; Benoit, Dries F.+STATISTICAL MODELLING+JUN 2012::Generalized structured additive regression based on Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 24 2006::BayesX: Analyzing Bayesian structured additive regression models+Brezger, A; Kneib, T; Lang, S+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+SEP 2005::Approximate Bayesian inference for quantiles+Dunson, T; Taylor, J.+Journal of Nonparametric Statistics+2005::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Penalized structured additive regression for space-time data: A Bayesian perspective+Fahrmeir, L; Kneib, T; Lang, S+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2004::Detection of risk factors for obesity in early childhood with quantile regression methods for longitudinal data+Fenske, N; Fahrmeir, L; Rzehak, P<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Hohle, M</span>.+Technical Report No. 38+2008::Identifying Risk Factors for Severe Childhood Malnutrition by Boosting Additive Quantile Regression+Fenske, Nora; Kneib, Thomas; Hothorn, Torsten+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2011::no title+Ghosh, J.; Ramamoorthi, R.+Bayesian nonparametrics+2010::Additive mixed models with Dirichlet process mixture and P-spline priors+Heinzl, Felix; Fahrmeir, Ludwig; Kneib, Thomas+ASTA-ADVANCES IN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS+2012::Approximate Dirichlet process computing in finite normal mixtures: Smoothing and prior information+Ishwaran, H; James, LF+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2002::Semiparametric Approach to a Random Effects Quantile Regression Model+Kim, Mi-Ok; Yang, Yunwen+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2011::Variable Selection and Model Choice in Geoadditive Regression Models+Kneib, Thomas; Hothorn, Torsten; Tutz, Gerhard+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2009::High dimensional structured additive regression models: Bayesian regularization, smoothing and predictive performance+Kneib, Thomas; Konrath, Susanne; Fahrmeir, Ludwig+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2011::QUANTILE SMOOTHING SPLINES+KOENKER, R; NG, P; PORTNOY, S+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1994::REGRESSION QUANTILES+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1978::Penalized triograms: total variation regularization for bivariate smoothing+Koenker, R; Mizera, I+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::Additive models for quantile regression: Model selection and confidence bandaids+Koenker, Roger+BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS+NOV 2011::no title+Koenker, Roger.+Quantile Regression+2005::Bayesian Semiparametric Modelling in Quantile Regression+Kottas, Athanasios; Krnjajic, Milovan+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2009::Gibbs sampling methods for Bayesian quantile regression+Kozumi, Hideo; Kobayashi, Genya+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2011::Simultaneous Confidence Bands for Penalized Spline Estimators+Krivobokova, Tatyana; Kneib, Thomas; Claeskens, Gerda+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2010::Bayesian Regularized Quantile Regression+Li, Qing; Xi, Ruibin; Lin, Nan+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2010::L-1-norm quantile regression+Li, Youjuan; Zhu, Ji+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2008::Spatial quantile multiple regression using the asymmetric Laplace process+Lum, C; Gelfand, A.+Bayesian Analysis+2012::Prediction inference with ensemble methods+Mayr, A.+THESIS LMU MUNICH+2010::Fast Nonparametric Quantile Regression With Arbitrary Smoothing Methods+Oh, Hee-Seok; Lee, Thomas C.

The location of the change-points may be related to points in time where public health strategies aiming at increasing the awareness of the public to a more rational use of antibiotics or targeting to reduce overconsumption of antibiotics were initiated.","amplitude,antibiotic use,change-point model,non-linear model,phase shift,seasonal variation","ANTIBIOTIC USE,COGNITIVE FUNCTION,SURVEILLANCE,REGRESSION","Minalu, Girma@Hasselt Univ, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat I BIOST, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Aerts, Marc@Hasselt Univ, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat I BIOST, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Coenen, Samuel@Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Ctr Gen Practice, Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Lab Med Microbiol, Antwerp, Belgium::Versporten, Ann@Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Lab Med Microbiol, Antwerp, Belgium::Muller, Arno@Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Lab Med Microbiol, Antwerp, Belgium::Adriaenssens, Niels@Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Ctr Gen Practice, Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Lab Med Microbiol, Antwerp, Belgium::Beutels, Philippe@Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modeling Infect Dis CHERMID, Ctr Evaluat Vaccinat, Antwerp, Belgium::Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt Univ, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat I BIOST, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat I BIOST, Louvain, Belgium::Goossens, Herman@Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Lab Med Microbiol, Antwerp, Belgium::Hens, Niel@Hasselt Univ, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat I BIOST, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst VAXINFECTIO, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modeling Infect Dis CHERMID, Ctr Evaluat Vaccinat, Antwerp, Belgium","Minalu, Girma@Hasselt University::Aerts, Marc@Hasselt University::Coenen, Samuel@University of Antwerp::Versporten, Ann@University of Antwerp::Muller, Arno@University of Antwerp::Adriaenssens, Niels@University of Antwerp::Beutels, Philippe@University of Antwerp::Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt University@KU Leuven::Goossens, Herman@University of Antwerp::Hens, Niel@Hasselt University@University of Antwerp","Coenen, Samuel@A-6410-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1238-8052::Hens, Niel@M-4445-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1881-0637::Beutels, Philippe@A-1919-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5034-3595","European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC): outpatient antibiotic use in Europe (1997-2009)+Adriaenssens, Niels; Coenen, Samuel; Versporten, Ann; et al.+JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY+DEC 2011::HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF CHANGEPOINT PROBLEMS+CARLIN, BP; GELFAND, AE; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1992::CONSISTENCY OF BAYESIAN PROCEDURES FOR VARIABLE SELECTION+Casella, George; Giron, F.

Multivariate skew-normal at linear mixed models for multi-outcome longitudinal data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13480283,JUN 2013,51,3,"More than one series of longitudinal data frequently encountered in biomedical, psychological and clinical research are routinely analyzed under a multivariate linear mixed model framework with underlying multivariate normality assumptions for the random effects and within-subject errors. However, such normality assumption might not offer robust inference if the data, even after being transformed, particularly exhibit skewness. In this paper, we propose a multivariate skew-normal linear mixed model constructed by assuming a multivariate skew-normal distribution for the random effects and a multivariate normal distribution for the random errors. A damped exponential correlation structure is adopted to address the within-subject autocorrelation possibly existing among irregularly observed measures. We present an efficient alternating expectation-conditional maximization (AECM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of parameters. The techniques for estimation of random effects and prediction of future outcomes are discussed. Our proposed model is motivated by, and used for, the analysis of AIDS clinical trials in which we investigate the association-of-the-evolutions' and the evolution-of-the-association' of HIV-1 RNA copies and CD4(+)T cell counts during antiviral therapies.","AECM algorithm,AIDS study,asymmetric random effects,damped exponential correlation,skewness","VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS,LIKELIHOOD-BASED INFERENCE,AIDS CLINICAL-TRIALS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,REGRESSION-MODELS,T-DISTRIBUTION,EM ALGORITHM,IMMUNOLOGICAL RESPONSES,ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY,NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS","Lin, Tsung-I@Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Inst Stat, Taichung 40227, Taiwan@China Med Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Taichung, Taiwan::Wang, Wan-Lun@Feng Chia Univ, Dept Stat, Taichung 40724, Taiwan","Lin, Tsung-I@China Medical University Taiwan@National Chung Hsing University::Wang, Wan-Lun@Feng Chia University","Wang, Wan-Lun@P-9036-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0344-7954::Lin, Tsung-I@Q-3423-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3992-1128","Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::no title+[Anonymous].+R:A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2011::Skew-normal linear mixed models+Arellano-Valle, R.B.; Bolfarine, H.; Lachos, V.H.+J.

Modelling house prices using multilevel structured additive regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13475385,APR 2013,37,9,"This paper analyzes house price data belonging to three hierarchical levels of spatial units. House selling prices with associated individual attributes (the elementary level-1) are grouped within municipalities (level-2), which form districts (level-3), which are themselves nested in counties (level-4). Additionally to individual attributes, explanatory covariates with possibly nonlinear effects are available on two of these spatial resolutions. We apply a multilevel version of structured additive regression (STAR) models to regress house prices on individual attributes and locational neighbourhood characteristics in a four-level hierarchical model. In multilevel STAR models the regression coefficients of a particular nonlinear term may themselves obey a regression model with structured additive predictor. The framework thus allows to incorporate nonlinear covariate effects and time trends, smooth spatial effects and complex interactions at every level of the hierarchy of the multilevel model. Moreover, we are able to decompose the spatial heterogeneity effect and investigate its magnitude at different spatial resolutions allowing for improved predictive quality even in the case of unobserved spatial units. Statistical inference is fully Bayesian and based on highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques that take advantage of the hierarchical structure in the data.","Bayesian hierarchical models,hedonic pricing models,multilevel models,MCMC,P-splines",SPLINES,"Brunauer, Wolfgang@Immobilien Rating GmbH, A-1020 Vienna, Austria::Lang, Stefan@Univ Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria::Umlauf, Nikolaus@Univ Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Brunauer, Wolfgang@Unknow::Lang, Stefan@University of Innsbruck::Umlauf, Nikolaus@University of Innsbruck","Lang, Stefan@E-7500-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0739-3858","Semiparametric estimation of a hedonic price function+Anglin, PM; Gencay, R+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+NOV-DEC 1996::Simultaneous selection of variables and smoothing parameters in structured additive regression models+Belitz, Christiane; Lang, Stefan+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 15 2008::SEMIPARAMETRIC HEDONIC PRICE MODELS: ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION+Bontemps, Christophe; Simioni, Michel; Surry, Yves+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+SEP-OCT 2008::no title+Brezger, A; Kneib, T; Lang, S.+BayesX manuals+2009::Generalized Structured Additive Regression Based on Bayesian P-Splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S.+Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis+2006::BayesX: Analyzing Bayesian structured additive regression models+Brezger, A; Kneib, T; Lang, S+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+SEP 2005::GIS and Spatial Analysis of Housing and Mortgage Markets+Can, Ayse.+Journal of Housing Research+1998::Hedonic price indexes with automotive examples+Court, A.T.+The Dynamics ofAutomobile Demand+1939::no title+DiPasquale, D; Wheaton, WC.+Urban economics and real estate markets+1996::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::no title+Fahrmeir, L.; Tutz, G.+Multivariate statistical modelling based on generalized linear models+2001::no title+Fahrmeir, L; Kneib, T; Lang, S<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Marx, B:</span>.+Regression: models, methods and applications+2013::Penalized structured additive regression for space-time data: A Bayesian perspective+Fahrmeir, L; Kneib, T; Lang, S+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2004::ESTIMATING THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS - A SURVEY AND CRITIQUE+FOLLAIN, JR; JIMENEZ, E+REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS+1985::Stochastic model specification search for Gaussian and partial non-Gaussian state space models+Fruehwirth-Schnatter, Sylvia; Wagner, Helga+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 2010::no title+Gelman,, A.; Hill,, J.+Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models+2007::no title+Goldstein, H.+Multilevel Statistical Models+2003::no title+Greene, W.

A regression model for special proportions,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13478274,APR 2013,28,6,"Credit cards are a financial product with special characteristics. Dividing the amount paid by the customer in a given month by the total bill results in a variable that is partly discrete and partly continuous, which we call the relative payment amount (RPA). This variable is discrete at 0, c and 1, and it is continuous in the open interval (c, 1). The 0 < c < 1 value is known and is given by the ratio between the value of the minimum payment and the full amount, and this value is not fixed for all customers. Thus, in practice, the RPA is a variable whose support of its distribution is non-constant across population units. In this work, we propose a regression model for the RPA. The model allows all of the unknown parameters of the conditional distribution of the response variable to be modelled as a function of the explanatory variables, and it also accounts for the non-constant known parameter c. The estimation of the parameters of this model is discussed, diagnostic analysis is addressed and closed-form expressions for the score function and for the Fisher's information matrix are provided. Moreover, some results related to the non-constant nature of c are obtained, simulation studies are performed and an application using real credit card data is presented.","beta distribution,credit card,inflated distributions,maximum likelihood estimator,proportions,truncated inflated beta distribution",BETA REGRESSION,"Pereira, Gustavo H.

Multinomial-based small area estimation of labour force indicators,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X13478873,APR 2013,22,9,"This paper deals with small area estimation of labour force characteristics like totals of employed, unemployed and inactive people and unemployment rates. Small area estimators of these quantities are derived from a multinomial logit mixed model with independent random effects on the categories of the response vector. The mean squared errors are estimated both by explicit formulas and by bootstrap methods. Two simulation experiments designed to analyze the behaviour of the introduced estimators have been carried out.

Bayesian P-spline estimation in hierarchical models specified by systems of affine differential equations,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X12471371,FEB 2013,19,4,"Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to model physical, chemical and biological processes. Current methods for parameter estimation can be computationally intensive and/or not suitable for inference and prediction. Frequentist approaches based on ODE-penalized smoothing techniques have recently solved part of these drawbacks. A full Bayesian approach based on ODE-penalized B-splines is proposed to jointly estimate ODE parameters and state functions from affine systems of differential equations. Simulations inspired by pharmacokinetic studies show that the proposed method provides comparable results to methods based on explicit solution of the ODEs and outperforms the frequentist ODE-penalized smoothing approach. The basic model is extended to a hierarchical one in order to study cases where several subjects are involved. This Bayesian hierarchical approach is illustrated on real data for the study of perfusion ratio after a femoral artery occlusion. Model selection is feasible through the analysis of the posterior distributions of the ODE adhesion parameters and is illustrated on a real pharmacokinetic dataset.","Bayesian ODE-penalized B-spline,dynamic systems,ODE model selection,ordinary differential equations,parameter estimation","PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,DYNAMIC-MODELS","Jaeger, Jonathan@Univ Liege, Inst Sci Humaines & Sociales, B-4000 Liege, Belgium::Lambert, Philippe@Univ Liege, Inst Sci Humaines & Sociales, B-4000 Liege, Belgium@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles, Louvain, Belgium","Jaeger, Jonathan@University of Liege::Lambert, Philippe@Universite Catholique Louvain@University of Liege",not exist,"NONLINEAR PARAMETER-ESTIMATION - A CASE-STUDY COMPARISON+BIEGLER, LT; DAMIANO, JJ; BLAU, GE+AICHE JOURNAL+JAN 1986::Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Modeling and Simulation, Second Edition+Bonate, PL+PHARMACOKINETIC-PHARMACODYNAMIC MODELING AND SIMULATION, SECOND EDITION+2011::Metropolis-Hastings algorithms with adaptive proposals+Cai, Bo; Meyer, Renate; Perron, Francois+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 2008::no title+Campbell, D.+Bayesian collocation tempering and generalized profiling for estimation of parameters from differential equation models+2007::Estimating dynamic models for gene regulation networks+Cao, Jiguo; Zhao, Hongyu+BIOINFORMATICS+JUL 15 2008::no title+De Boor,, C.+A practical Guide to Splines+2001::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Robust specification of the roughness penalty prior distribution in spatially adaptive Bayesian P-splines models+Jullion, Astrid; Lambert, Philippe+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 1 2007::KINETICS OF INDOMETHACIN ABSORPTION, ELIMINATION, AND ENTEROHEPATIC CIRCULATION IN MAN+KWAN, KC; BREAULT, GO; UMBENHAUER, ER; et al.+JOURNAL OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS+1976::Archimedean copula estimation using Bayesian splines smoothing techniques+Lambert, Philippe+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 15 2007::Bayesian P-splines+Lang, S; Brezger, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2004::Bayesian analysis of population PK/PD models: General concepts and software+Lunn, DJ; Best, N; Thomas, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS+JUN 2002::Parameter estimation in continuous-time dynamic models using principal differential analysis+Poyton, AA; Varziri, MS; McAuley, KB; et al.+COMPUTERS &amp; CHEMICAL ENGINEERING+FEB 15 2006::Parameter estimation for differential equations: a generalized smoothing approach+Ramsay, J.

Clustering in linear mixed models with approximate Dirichlet process mixtures using EM algorithm,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X12471372,FEB 2013,60,13,"In linear mixed models, the assumption of normally distributed random effects is often inappropriate and unnecessarily restrictive. The proposed approximate Dirichlet process mixture assumes a hierarchical Gaussian mixture that is based on the truncated version of the stick breaking presentation of the Dirichlet process. In addition to the weakening of distributional assumptions, the specification allows to identify clusters of observations with a similar random effects structure. An Expectation-Maximization algorithm is given that solves the estimation problem and that, in certain respects, may exhibit advantages over Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches when modelling with Dirichlet processes. The method is evaluated in a simulation study and applied to the dynamics of unemployment in Germany as well as lung function growth data.","approximate Dirichlet process mixture,EM algorithm,likelihood inference,linear mixed models,stick breaking","GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES,FUNCTION MINIMIZATION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,FUNCTIONAL DATA,INFERENCE,PRIORS,DISTRIBUTIONS,POPULATION,BAYES","Heinzl, Felix@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, Munich, Germany::Tutz, Gerhard@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, Munich, Germany","Heinzl, Felix@University of Munich::Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich",not exist,"no title+Bates, D; Machler, M; Bolker, B.+1me4: Linear mixed-effects models using S4 classes.

We apply Lagrange methods to give a general Newton-Raphson algorithm for such a GLM in which parameters are estimated, constraints are applied and smoothing is performed simultaneously. We express the Lee-Carter model, an important model for the forecasting of human mortality, in terms of GLMs, and use our method to estimate the parameters in the model. The smoothing option allows us to improve the forecasting properties of the model. We compare the performance of (i) the Poisson model with log link for the force of mortality and (ii) the binomial model with logit link for the probability of death in a calendar year.

Constrained ordination analysis in the presence of zero inflation,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X12460129,DEC 2012,27,5,"Constrained ordination analysis, with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) as its best known method, is a class of popular techniques for analyzing species abundance studies in ecology. These methods rely on distributional assumptions on the conditional abundance distributions. For abundance observations, the Poisson and the negative binomial distributions are the most frequently considered distributions. However, many large abundance studies result in many zero abundances. This may happen because of several reasons. To name one, in microbial community ecology the abundances of a very large number of species are nowadays often obtained by means of sequencing the pooled DNA sample. Due to the small sensitivity for rare species, too many observed zeroes are to be expected. Moreover, more zeroes are expected with increasing number of species. We propose a constrained ordination method based on zero-altered count distributions (e.g., zero-inflated Poisson, hurdle models). We show how the parameters and the environmental gradients can be estimated. In simulation studies we examine the behaviour of the estimators, and we apply the method to a real data set. We conclude that in the presence of zero inflation our methods give better results than the Poisson-based approaches.","Correspondence analysis,dimension reduction,ecology,hurdle model,zero-inflated Poisson","CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS,GAUSSIAN ORDINATION,COUNT DATA,MODELS,REGRESSION,VEGETATION,ABUNDANCE,ECOLOGY","Zhang, Yingjie@Univ Ghent, Dept Math Modelling Stat & Bioinformat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium::Thas, Olivier@Univ Ghent, Dept Math Modelling Stat & Bioinformat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium@Univ Wollongong, Sch Math & Appl Stat, Ctr Stat & Survey Methodol, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia","Zhang, Yingjie@Ghent University::Thas, Olivier@University of Wollongong@Ghent University","Thas, Olivier@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6442-4089","no title+[Anonymous].+R:A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2011::Modeling count data of rare species: Some statistical issues+Cunningham, RB; Lindenmayer, DB+ECOLOGY+MAY 2005::BIAS REDUCTION OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATES+FIRTH, D+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1993::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ORDINATION - SOME IMPROVEMENTS AND FURTHER TESTS+GOODALL, DW; JOHNSON, RW+VEGETATIO+DEC 1 1987::NON-LINEAR ORDINATION IN SEVERAL DIMENSIONS - A MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD APPROACH+GOODALL, DW; JOHNSON, RW+VEGETATIO+1982::no title+Greenacre, M.+Correspondence analysis in practice+2007::Accuracy and quality of massively parallel DNA pyrosequencing+Huse, Susan M.; Huber, Julie A.; Morrison, Hilary G.; et al.+GENOME BIOLOGY+2007::Canonical correspondence analysis as an approximation to Gaussian ordination+Johnson, KW; Altman, NS+ENVIRONMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1999::Wrinles in the rare biosphere: pyrosequencing errors can lead to artificial inflation of diversity estimates+Kunin, V; Engelbrektson, A; Ochman, H<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Hugenholtz, P</span>.+Environmental Microbiology+2010::ZERO-INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION, WITH AN APPLICATION TO DEFECTS IN MANUFACTURING+LAMBERT, D+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::Zero tolerance ecology: improving ecological inference by modelling the source of zero observations+Martin, TG; Wintle, BA; Rhodes, JR; et al.+ECOLOGY LETTERS+NOV 2005::Microbial biogeography: putting microorganisms on the map+Martiny, JBH; Bohannan, BJM; Brown, JH; et al.+NATURE REVIEWS MICROBIOLOGY+FEB 2006::SPECIFICATION AND TESTING OF SOME MODIFIED COUNT DATA MODELS+MULLAHY, J+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 1986::Comparing species abundance models+Potts, Joanne M.; Elith, Jane+ECOLOGICAL MODELLING+NOV 16 2006::RELATIONSHIPS AMONG SEVERAL METHODS OF LINEARLY CONSTRAINED CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS+TAKANE, Y; YANAI, H; MAYEKAWA, S+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1991::THE ANALYSIS OF VEGETATION-ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS BY CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS+TER BRAAK, CJF+VEGETATIO+APR 30 1987::CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS AND RELATED MULTIVARIATE METHODS IN AQUATIC ECOLOGY+TERBRAAK, CJF; VERDONSCHOT, PFM+AQUATIC SCIENCES+1995::CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS - A NEW EIGENVECTOR TECHNIQUE FOR MULTIVARIATE DIRECT GRADIENT ANALYSIS+TERBRAAK, CJF+ECOLOGY+OCT 1986::WEIGHTED AVERAGING, LOGISTIC-REGRESSION AND THE GAUSSIAN RESPONSE MODEL+TERBRAAK, CJF; LOOMAN, CWN+VEGETATIO+JAN 30 1986::EFFECTS OF REINDEER GRAZING ON UNDERSTOREY VEGETATION IN DRY PINUS-SYLVESTRIS FORESTS+VARE, H; OHTONEN, R; OKSANEN, J+JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE+SEP 1995::Quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression: how should we model overdispersed count data?+Ver Hoef, J; Boveng, P.+IEcology+2007::Chemical limnology in coastal East Antarctic lakes: monitoring future climate change in centres of endemism and biodiversity+Verleyen, Elie; Hodgson, Dominic A.; Gibson, John; et al.+ANTARCTIC SCIENCE+FEB 2012::Modelling the abundance of rare species: Statistical models for counts with extra zeros+Welsh, AH; Cunningham, RB; Donnelly, CF; et al.+ECOLOGICAL MODELLING+JUL 1996::no title+Winkelmann, R.+Econometric Analysis of Count Data+2008::A new technique for maximum-likelihood canonical Gaussian ordination+Yee, TW+ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS+NOV 2004::Reduced-rank vector generalized linear models+Yee, TW; Hastle, TJ+STATISTICAL MODELLING+MAR 2003::Constrained ordination analysis with flexible response functions+Zhu, M; Hastie, TJ; Walther, G+ECOLOGICAL MODELLING+OCT 10 2005"
Modelling random effect variance with double hierarchical generalized linear models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X12460132,DEC 2012,31,2,"Random-effect models are becoming increasingly popular in the analysis of data. Lee and Nelder (2006) introduced double hierarchical generalized linear models (DHGLMs) in which not only the mean but also the residual variance (overdispersion) can be further modelled as random-effect models. In this article, we introduce DHGLMs that allow random-effect models for both the variances of random effects and the residual variance. We show how to use this general model class for the analysis of data and discuss how to select the best fitting model using the likelihood and various model-checking plots.","Double hierarchical generalized linear models,hierarchical generalized linear models,hierarchical likelihood,random effects","LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS,MIXED MODELS,COUNT DATA,INFERENCE,INFORMATION","Lee, Youngjo@Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 151742, South Korea::Noh, Maengseok@Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Pusan 608737, South Korea","Lee, Youngjo@Seoul National University::Noh, Maengseok@Pukyong National University",not exist,"Modelling variance heterogeneity in normal regression using GLIM+Aitkin, M.+Appl.

Small area semiparametric additive monotone models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X12465796,DEC 2012,23,3,"In this paper, semiparametric monotone mixed models are introduced, exploring, in particular, the problems of estimation and bootstrapping. The models are deined in a small area setting, using the assumption that some of the auxiliary variables have a monotone relationship with the response, and with the incorporation of linear terms to model other auxiliaries as the dummy variables. An estimator for the variance of the random effects is proposed and two bootstrap approaches, specially designed for monotone regression, are given to estimate the mean squared error for the area means. A simulation experiment is carried out to compare the performance of the new model-based estimators against the Fay-Herriot approach and to conirm the good performance of the bootstrap. The semiparametric model-based area estimators are also compared with the parametric-based estimators using data on a survey of lakes, where the questions of the prediction of missing data and model selection are nicely solved using simple proposals.","isotonic models,mixed models,monotone models,order restricted inference,small area estimation","MIXED MODELS,REGRESSION,BOOTSTRAP,PREDICTION,ESTIMATORS","Rueda, C.@Univ Valladolid, Fac Ciencias, Inst Matemat, IMUVA, E-47005 Valladolid, Spain::Lombardia, M.

An application of Bayesian growth mixture modelling to estimate infection incidences from repeated serological tests,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X12465797,DEC 2012,30,1,"Diagnoses of infectious diseases are often performed using antibody detection through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. These data are usually dichotomized into positive and negative samples using a fixed cut-off and prevalences of infection are subsequently estimated assuming perfect correspondence between the dichotomized test results and infection status. In contrast to this approach, in this case study, we estimate the effect of distributing insecticide impregnated bednets to prevent Leishmania infection through mixture modelling of the original continuous data. We analyze the data from a cluster randomized intervention trial using a generalized latent variable model consisting of a longitudinal mixture model for the observed outcome and a Hidden Markov model for the underlying unobserved disease status to estimate the effect of an intervention. The response and structural models are jointly estimated in a Bayesian framework. This model has the advantage that it avoids the need to choose an arbitrary cut-off and allows for uncertainty in the infection status. In this paper, we describe the development of the model and selection of priors, the application to the motivating data, model checking and simulation results.","diagnostic tests,growth mixture model,Hidden Markov model,latent variable,visceral leishmaniasis","DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS,PARATUBERCULOSIS,LEISHMANIASIS,REGRESSION,DISEASE,ABSENCE,INDIA,NEPAL","Menten, J.@Inst Trop Med, Dept Clin Sci, Clin Trials Unit, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium@KULeuven, Leuven Biostat & Stat Bioinformat Ctr, Louvain, Belgium::Boelaert, M.@Inst Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium::Lesaffre, E.@KULeuven, Leuven Biostat & Stat Bioinformat Ctr, Louvain, Belgium@Erasmus MC, Dept Biostat, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Menten, J.@Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM)@KU Leuven::Boelaert, M.@Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM)::Lesaffre, E.@KU Leuven@Erasmus University Rotterdam@Erasmus University Medical Center","Boelaert, Marleen@E-2698-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8051-6776","Bayesian checking of hierarchical models+Bayarri, MJ; Castellanos, ME.+Technical report+2004::Bayesian semiparametric ROC curve estimation and disease diagnosis+Branscum, Adam J.; Johnson, Wesley O.; Hanson, Timothy E.; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 2008::no title+Chappuis, F.; Sundar, S.; Hailu, A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Ghalib, H.; Rijal, S.; Peeling, R.

Estimating the population prevalence and force of infection directly from antibody titres,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X12457495,OCT 2012,30,7,"The use of threshold values in order to diagnose individual subjects as being 'susceptible' or 'infected or recovered/immune' for a specific infection is virtually always prone to false positive, false negative or inconclusive classifications. Such misclassifications might lead to biased estimates for epidemiological parameters, such as the prevalence and the force of infection. In this article, we propose to estimate these epidemiological parameters directly from antibody titres, using an underlying mixture model. The method is applied to estimate the Salmonella serological prevalence in pigs and the age-dependent force of infection using serological data on the Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) in humans. The threshold and direct method are compared through a simulation study.","force of infection,mixture model,serological data,test misclassification,prevalence","COMPUTER-ASSISTED ANALYSIS,MIXTURE-MODELS,PIG-HERDS,LIKELIHOOD,REGRESSION,ENGLAND,SPLINES,RUBELLA,WALES","Bollaerts, K.@Sci Inst Publ Hlth, Brussels, Belgium::Aerts, M.@Hasselt Univ, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Diepenbeek, Belgium::Shkedy, Z.@Hasselt Univ, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Diepenbeek, Belgium::Faes, C.@Hasselt Univ, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Diepenbeek, Belgium::Van der Stede, Y.@Vet & Agrochem Res Ctr, Brussels, Belgium::Beutels, P.@Univ Antwerp, Ctr Evaluat Vaccinat, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modeling Infect Dis, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium::Hens, N.@Hasselt Univ, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Diepenbeek, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, Ctr Evaluat Vaccinat, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modeling Infect Dis, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium","Bollaerts, K.@Unknow::Aerts, M.@Hasselt University@KU Leuven::Shkedy, Z.@Hasselt University@KU Leuven::Faes, C.@Hasselt University@KU Leuven::Van der Stede, Y.@Ghent University::Beutels, P.@University of Antwerp::Hens, N.@Hasselt University@KU Leuven@University of Antwerp","Hens, Niel@M-4445-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1881-0637::Faes, Christel@E-1384-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1878-9869::Van der Stede, Yves@I-4626-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7294-3698::Beutels, Philippe@A-1919-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5034-3595","Salmonella serosurveillance: Different statistical methods to categorise pig herds based on serological data+Abrahantes, J.

The Cox shared frailty model with log-skew-normal frailties,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X12460146,OCT 2012,35,7,"Clustered survival data arise when groups of failure times share a common ingredient; typically, they refer to the same individual or individuals with a common factor. When the association between failure times within the same cluster is of interest, statistical methods called frailty models have been used. The frailty is an unobserved random component which affects the risk level, changing from cluster to cluster but shared by all observations within the same cluster. Various probability distributions have been proposed for the frailty term, with special emphasis on the gamma and log-normal distribution. Since adequate modelling of the frailty distribution is essential to properly investigate the dependence structure, we introduce a new class of frailty models with a flexible distribution form. Specifically, we adopt the skew-normal distribution for the log-transformed frailty, leading to an extension of the log-normal model. After presenting the methodology connected to this choice, we illustrate it with a case study of multiple myeloma patients with autologous stem cells transplantation.","EM algorithm,frailty model,multivariate survival analysis,skewed-normal distribution","FLEXIBLE DISTRIBUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS,INTERVAL-CENSORED DATA,EM ALGORITHM,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,SURVIVAL MODELS,LIFE-TABLES,REGRESSION","Callegaro, A.@Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, I-35121 Padua, Italy::Iacobelli, S.@Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy","Callegaro, A.@University of Padua::Iacobelli, S.@University of Rome Tor Vergata",not exist,"Modelling heterogeneity in survival analysis by the compound Poisson distribution+Aalen, OO.+Ann Appl Probab+1992::A version of the EM algorithm for proportional hazard model with random effects+Abrahantes, JC; Burzykowski, T+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+DEC 2005::The multivariate skew-normal distribution+Azzalini, A; DallaValle, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::Generalized gamma frailty model+Balakrishnan, N.; Peng, Yingwei+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 30 2006::MODEL FOR ASSOCIATION IN BIVARIATE LIFE TABLES AND ITS APPLICATION IN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL-STUDIES OF FAMILIAL TENDENCY IN CHRONIC DISEASE INCIDENCE+CLAYTON, DG+BIOMETRIKA+1978::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::The Frailty Model Introduction+Duchateau, Luc; Janssen, Paul+FRAILTY MODEL+2008::BIAS REDUCTION OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATES+FIRTH, D+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1993::no title+Hougaard, P.+Analysis of Multivariate Survival Data+2000::A CLASS OF MULTIVARIATE FAILURE TIME DISTRIBUTIONS+HOUGAARD, P+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1986::SURVIVAL MODELS FOR HETEROGENEOUS POPULATIONS DERIVED FROM STABLE-DISTRIBUTIONS+HOUGAARD, P+BIOMETRIKA+AUG 1986::no title+HOUGAARD P+LIFETIME DATA ANAL+1995::Modeling multilevel survival data using frailty models+Kim, Sungduk; Dey, Dipak K.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2008::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF RANDOM EFFECTS USING THE COX MODEL BASED ON THE EM ALGORITHM+KLEIN, JP+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1992::A Bayesian analysis of multivariate doubly-interval-censored dental data+Komarek, A; Lesaffre, E; Harkanen, T; et al.+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2005::Bayesian accelerated failure time model with multivariate doubly interval-censored data and flexible distributional assumptions+Komarek, Arnost; Lesaffre, Emmanuel+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2008::The regression analysis of correlated interval-censored data: illustration using accelerated failure time models with flexible distributional assumptions+Komarek, Arnost; Lesaffre, Emmanuel+STATISTICAL MODELLING+DEC 2009::A marginal likelihood approach to estimation in frailty models+Lam, KF; Kuk, AYC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::FINDING THE OBSERVED INFORMATION MATRIX WHEN USING THE EM ALGORITHM+LOUIS, TA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::REGRESSION WITH FRAILTY IN SURVIVAL ANALYSIS+MCGILCHRIST, CA; AISBETT, CW+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1991::Use of frailty models for multivariate survival data+Oakes, D.+P 17 INT BIOM C+1994::Estimation of multivariate frailty models using penalized partial likelihood+Ripatti, S; Palmgren, J+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2000::On a Bayesian multivariate survival model with a skewed frailty+Sahu, SK; Dey, DK+SKEW-ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS: A JOURNEY BEYOND NORMALITY+2004::Bias prevention of maximum likelihood estimates for scalar skew normal and skew t distributions+Sartori, Nicola+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 1 2006::no title+Therneau, T.+Survival: Survival Analysis, Including Penalised Likelihood.

Interventions in log-linear Poisson autoregression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1201200401,AUG 2012,29,13,"We consider the problem of estimating and detecting outliers in count time series data following a log-linear observation driven model. Log-linear models for count time series arise naturally because they correspond to the canonical link function of the Poisson distribution. They yield both positive and negative dependence, and covariate information can be conveniently incorporated. Within this framework, we establish test procedures for detection of unusual events ('interventions') leading to different kinds of outliers, we implement joint maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and outlier sizes and we derive formulae for correcting the data for detected interventions. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated with two real data examples. The first example offers a fresh data analytic point of view towards the polio data. Our methodology identifies different forms of outliers in these data by an observation-driven model. The second example deals with some campylobacterosis data which we analyzed in a previous communication, by a different model. The results are reconfirmed by the new model that we put forward in this communication. The reliability of the procedure is verified using artificial data examples.","generalized linear models,level shifts,likelihood,link function,observation-driven models,outlier detection,parametric bootstrap,power,transient shifts","MARKOV REGRESSION-MODELS,TIME-SERIES,STRUCTURAL-CHANGE,CHANGE-POINT,PARAMETER,OUTLIERS,COUNTS,TESTS,INFERENCE","Fokianos, Konstantinos@Univ Cyprus, Dept Math & Stat, Nicosia, Cyprus::Fried, Roland@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","Fokianos, Konstantinos@University of Cyprus::Fried, Roland@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"OPTIMAL TESTS WHEN A NUISANCE PARAMETER IS PRESENT ONLY UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE+ANDREWS, DWK; PLOBERGER, W+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1994::TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::Generalized score tests for composite hypotheses+Basawa, IV.+Estimating functions+1991::INTERVENTION ANALYSIS WITH APPLICATIONS TO ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS+BOX, GEP; TIAO, GC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1975::no title+BRUMBACK BA+J AM STAT ASSOC+2000::ESTIMATION OF TIME-SERIES PARAMETERS IN THE PRESENCE OF OUTLIERS+CHANG, I; TIAO, GC; CHEN, C+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1988::JOINT ESTIMATION OF MODEL PARAMETERS AND OUTLIER EFFECTS IN TIME-SERIES+CHEN, C; LIU, LM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Observation-driven models for Poisson counts+Davis, RA; Dunsmuir, WTM; Streett, SB+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2003::A negative binomial model for time series of counts+Davis, Richard A.; Wu, Rongning+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2009::no title+Fahrmeir, L.; Tutz, G.+Multivariate statistical modelling based on generalized linear models+2001::Integer-valued GARCH process+Ferland, Rene; Latour, Alain; Oraichi, Driss+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+NOV 2006::Partial likelihood inference for time series following generalized linear models+Fokianos, K; Kedem, B+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAR 2004::Log-linear Poisson autoregression+Fokianos, Konstantinos; Tjostheim, Dag+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAR 2011::Interventions in INGARCH processes+Fokianos, Konstantinos; Fried, Roland+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAY 2010::OUTLIERS IN TIME SERIES+FOX, AJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::Approximate asymptotic p values for structural-change tests+Hansen, BE+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1997::Time series of count data: modeling, estimation and diagnostics+Jung, Robert C.; Kukuk, Martin; Liesenfeld, Roman+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 15 2006::Detection of outlier patches in autoregressive time series+Justel, A; Pena, D; Tsay, RS+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2001::Parameter change test for random coefficient integer-valued autoregressive processes with application to polio data analysis+Kang, Jiwon; Lee, Sangyeol+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAR 2009::no title+Kedem, B; Fokianos, K.+Regression Models for Time Series Analysis+2002::TIME-SERIES MODELS BASED ON GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS - SOME FURTHER RESULTS+LI, WK+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1994::TESTING MODEL ADEQUACY FOR SOME MARKOV REGRESSION-MODELS FOR TIME-SERIES+LI, WK+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1991::no title+MacDonald, IL; Zucchini, W.+Hidden Markov and other models for discrete-valued time series+1997::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::Information criterion for Gaussian change-point model+Ninomiya, Y+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 1 2005::TIME-SERIES MODEL-SPECIFICATION IN THE PRESENCE OF OUTLIERS+TSAY, RS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1986::MARKOV REGRESSION-MODELS FOR TIME-SERIES - A QUASI-LIKELIHOOD APPROACH+ZEGER, SL; QAQISH, B+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1988::A REGRESSION-MODEL FOR TIME-SERIES OF COUNTS+ZEGER, SL+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1988::Inference for pth-order random coefficient integer-valued autoregressive processes+Zheng, HT; Basawa, IV; Datta, S+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAY 2006"
Bayesian Tobit quantile regression model for medical expenditure panel survey data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1201200402,AUG 2012,40,7,"High expenditure on healthcare is an important segment of the U.S. economy, making healthcare cost modelling valuable in decision-making processes over a wide array of domains. In this paper, we analyze medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) data. Tobit regression model has been popularly used for the medical expenditures. However, it is no longer sufficient for the MEPS data because: (i) the distribution of the expenditures shows skewness, heavy tails and heterogeneity; (ii) most predictors are categorical, including binary, nominal and ordinal variables; (iii) there are a few predictors which may be nonlinearly related to the response. We therefore propose a Bayesian Tobit quantile regression model to describe a complete distributional view on how the medical expenditures depend on the various predictors. Specifically, we assume an asymmetric Laplace error distribution to adapt the quantile regression to a Bayesian setting. Then, we propose a modified group Lasso for categorical factor selection, and a smoothing Gaussian prior for modelling the nonlinear effects. The estimates and their uncertainties are obtained using an efficient Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling method. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by modelling 2007 MEPS data.","asymmetric Laplace distribution,group lasso,MCMC,medical expenditure panel survey,nonlinear effect,Tobit quantile regression","HEALTH-CARE COSTS,SAMPLE SELECTION,INFERENCE,VARIABLES,LASSO","Yue, Yu Ryan@CUNY, Zicklin Sch Business, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA::Hong, Hyokyoung Grace@CUNY, Zicklin Sch Business, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA","Yue, Yu Ryan@Baruch College (CUNY)@City University of New York (CUNY) System::Hong, Hyokyoung Grace@Baruch College (CUNY)@City University of New York (CUNY) System",not exist,"The lifetime distribution of health care costs+Alemayehu, B; Warner, KE+HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH+JUN 2004::SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::Health-Care Expenditures of Overweight and Obese Males and Females in the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey by Age Cohort+Bell, Janice F.; Zimmerman, Frederick J.; Arterburn, David E.; et al.+OBESITY+JAN 2011::Markov chain Monte Carlo in conditionally Gaussian state space models+Carter, CK; Kohn, R+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1996::no title+Chhikara, R.

Meta-analysis of diagnostic studies based upon SROC-curves: a mixed model approach using the Lehmann family,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1201200403,AUG 2012,48,11,"Meta-analysis of diagnostic studies experiences the common problem that different studies might not be comparable since they have been using a different cut-off value for the continuous or ordered categorical diagnostic test value defining different regions for which the diagnostic test is defined to be positive. Hence specificities and sensitivities arising from different studies might vary just because the underlying cut-off value had been different. To cope with the cut-off value problem, interest is usually directed towards the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which consists of pairs of sensitivities and false positive rate (1-specificity). In the context of meta-analysis, one pair represents one study and the associated diagram is called SROC curve where the S stands for 'summary'. The paper will consider-as a novel approach-modelling SROC curves with the Lehmann family that assumes log-sensitivity is proportional to the log-false positive rate across studies. The approach allows for study-specific false positive rates which are treated as (infinitely many) nuisance parameters and eliminated by means of the profile likelihood. The adjusted profile likelihood turns out to have a simple univariate Gaussian structure which is ultimately used for building inference for the parameter of the Lehmann family. The Lehmann model is further extended by allowing the constant of proportionality to vary across studies to cope with unobserved heterogeneity. The simple Gaussian form of the adjusted profile likelihood allows this extension easily as a form of a mixed model in which unobserved heterogeneity is incorporated by means of a normal random effect.

Functional prediction of intraday cumulative returns,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1201200404,AUG 2012,29,4,"We define cumulative intraday returns and consider their prediction from such returns on a market index. We model these returns as curves in a function space. We propose several functional regression models which can be viewed as extensions of the capital asset pricing model to intraday returns defined as curves. After deriving parameter estimates and prediction functions for these models, we compare their prediction errors by application to cumulative intraday returns of large U.S. corporations.

Process modelling for contingency tables with ordered categories,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001200301,JUN 2012,26,0,"We consider the setting of a multi-way contingency table with ordinal classifications. The contribution of this paper is to propose a joint probability model for the uncensored variables that is apart from the imposed categorization. Specifically, for an m-way table, we assume that the cell counts arise as a binned point pattern over a bounded set in m-dimensional Euclidean space where the point pattern is a realization of a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The intensity which drives the point pattern is itself viewed as a realization of a log Gaussian process over the set.

With such an approach we achieve full inference regarding the underlying joint distribution, in particular, inference for familiar associations between the ordinal variables in the absence of interval censoring. Additionally, inference can be provided for any newly created cells where such creation is achieved through redefinition of the ordinal classifications. That is, rather than ad hoc reallocation, we achieve a fully model-based reallocation enabling quantification of uncertainty. For a contingency table with nominal classifications as well, our approach creates an intensity for the ordinal variables for each level of the nominal variables.

The methodology is detailed within a hierarchical framework, showing associated computation and convenient dimension reduction techniques to facilitate model fitting. We illustrate with both simulated data and a real census dataset.","Bayesian hierarchical model,block summing,Cox process,Gaussian processes,nonhomogeneous Poisson process,separable covariance functions,spatial interpolation","ORDINAL DATA,ASSOCIATION MODELS,REGRESSION-MODELS,VARIABLES","Heaton, Matthew J.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Gray, Simone C.@US EPA, Durham, NC USA::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Heaton, Matthew J.@Duke University::Gray, Simone C.@United States Environmental Protection Agency::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of ordinal categorical data+2010::MODEL-BASED BAYESIAN METHODS FOR ESTIMATING CELL PROPORTIONS IN CROSS-CLASSIFICATION TABLES HAVING ORDERED CATEGORIES+AGRESTI, A; CHUANG, C+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 1989::Modelling ordered categorical data: Recent advances and future challenges+Agresti, A+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 30 1999::REGRESSION AND ORDERED CATEGORICAL VARIABLES+ANDERSON, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1984::no title+Banerjee, S; Carlin, B; Gelfand, A.+Hierarchical modelling and analysis for spatial data+2004::ON THE BIVARIATE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION AND ASSOCIATION MODELS FOR ORDINAL CATEGORICAL-DATA+BECKER, MP+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+OCT 1989::Spatial Poisson regression for health and exposure data measured at disparate resolutions+Best, NG; Ickstadt, K; Wolpert, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::no title+Bishop,, Y.M.M.; Fienberg,, S.E.; Holland,, P.W.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis: Theory and Practice+2007::The analysis of contingency tables with ordinal data: An application to monitoring antibiotic resistance+Bonetto, C.; Giannerini, S.; Giovagnoli, A.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT 30 2006::Bayesian analysis for correlated ordinal data models+Chen, M.H.; Dey, D.K.+Generalized Linear Models: A Bayesian Perspective+2000::Marginal regression models for the analysis of positive association of ordinal response variables+Colombi, R; Forcina, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::no title+Cox, D.

Maximum likelihood estimation of mixed C-vines with application to exchange rates,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1101200302,JUN 2012,41,60,"Multivariate copulas are commonly used in economics, finance and risk management. They allow for very flexible dependency structures, even though they are applied to transformed financial data after marginal time dependencies are removed. This is necessary to facilitate statistical parameter estimation. In this paper we consider a very flexible class of mixed C-vines, which allows the variables to be ordered according to their influence. Vines are built from bivariate copulas only and the term 'mixed' refers to allowing the pair-copula family to be chosen individually for each term. In addition there are many C-vine structure specifications possible and therefore we propose a novel data driven sequential selection procedure, which selects both the C-vine structure and its attached pair-copula families with parameters. After the model selection maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the parameters is facilitated using the sequential estimates as starting values. An extensive simulation study shows a satisfactory performance of ML estimates in small samples. Finally an application involving US-exchange rates demonstrates the need for mixed C-vine models.","copulas,C-vine,maximum likelihood estimation,pair-copula construction,US-exchange rates","DEPENDENT RANDOM-VARIABLES,PAIR-COPULA CONSTRUCTIONS,MODEL SELECTION,STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,FIT,DECOMPOSITION,TESTS","Czado, Claudia@Tech Univ Munich, Zentrum Math, D-85747 Garching, Germany::Schepsmeier, Ulf@Tech Univ Munich, Zentrum Math, D-85747 Garching, Germany::Min, Aleksey@Tech Univ Munich, Zentrum Math, D-85747 Garching, Germany","Czado, Claudia@Technical University of Munich::Schepsmeier, Ulf@Technical University of Munich::Min, Aleksey@Technical University of Munich","Czado, Claudia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6329-5438","Pair-copula constructions of multiple dependence+Aas, Kjersti;

The heterogeneity is taken into account by replacing the traditional assumption of Gaussian distributed factors by a finite mixture of multivariate Gaussians. The aim of the proposed model is twofold: it allows to achieve dimension reduction when the data are dichotomous and, simultaneously, it performs model based clustering in the latent space. Model estimation is obtained by means of a maximum likelihood method via a generalized version of the EM algorithm. In order to evaluate the performance of the model a simulation study and two real applications are illustrated.","model based clustering,latent trait analysis,EM algorithm","CONTINGENCY-TABLES,LATENT TRAIT,EM ALGORITHM","Cagnone, Silvia@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy::Viroli, Cinzia@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Cagnone, Silvia@University of Bologna::Viroli, Cinzia@University of Bologna","Viroli, Cinzia@F-5786-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3278-5266","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::The Analysis and Interpretation of Multivariate Data for Social Scientists+Bartholomew, D; Steele, F; Moustaki, I<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Galbraith, J</span>.+ANAL INTERPRETATION+2002::A goodness of fit test for sparse 2(p) contingency tables+Bartholomew, DJ; Leung, SO+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2002::no title+Bartholomew, DJ; Knott, M.+Latent Variable Models and Factor Analysis+1999::MARGINAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF ITEM PARAMETERS - APPLICATION OF AN EM ALGORITHM+BOCK, RD; AITKIN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1981::Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm+Dempster, N; Laird, M; Rubin, DB.+J Royal Stat Soc Ser B+1977::no title+Dennis, J.

Bayesian adaptive Lasso quantile regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1101200304,JUN 2012,41,36,"Recently, variable selection by penalized likelihood has attracted much research interest. In this paper, we propose adaptive Lasso quantile regression (BALQR) from a Bayesian perspective. The method extends the Bayesian Lasso quantile regression by allowing different penalization parameters for different regression coefficients. Inverse gamma prior distributions are placed on the penalty parameters. We treat the hyperparameters of the inverse gamma prior as unknowns and estimate them along with the other parameters. A Gibbs sampler is developed to simulate the parameters from the posterior distributions. Through simulation studies and analysis of a prostate cancer dataset, we compare the performance of the BALQR method proposed with six existing Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods. The simulation studies and the prostate cancer data analysis indicate that the BALQR method performs well in comparison to the other approaches.","Gibbs sampler,Lasso,quantile regression,skewed Laplace distribution","NONCONCAVE PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD,VARIABLE SELECTION,ORACLE PROPERTIES,SHRINKAGE,INFERENCE,MODELS","Alhamzawi, Rahim@Brunel Univ, Dept Math, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England::Yu, Keming@Brunel Univ, Dept Math, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England::Benoit, Dries F.@Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Mkt, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Alhamzawi, Rahim@Brunel University::Yu, Keming@Brunel University::Benoit, Dries F.@Ghent University","Alhamzawi, Rahim@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1912-9579","Prior elicitation for mixed quantile regression with an allometric model+Alhamzawi, Rahim; Yu, Keming; Vinciotti, Veronica; et al.+ENVIRONMETRICS+NOV 2011::SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::no title+Benoit, DF; Al-Hamzawi, R; Yu, K<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Van den Poel, D</span>.+bayesQR: Bayesian quantile regression+2011::Binary quantile regression: a Bayesian approach based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution+Benoit, Dries F.; Van den Poel, Dirk+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+NOV-DEC 2012::Heuristics of instability and stabilization in model selection+Breiman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1996::no title+Chhikara, R.

Missing observations in paired comparison data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001200201,APR 2012,44,5,"This paper considers the analysis of paired comparison experiments in the presence of missing responses. Various scenarios for how missing data might arise in paired comparisons are considered, and it is suggested that the most common types of missing data mechanism would be either missing completely at random or missing not at random. A new model is then proposed based on the paired comparison set of responses augmented by a set of missing data indicators for each comparison. Taking a sample selection approach, the proposed new method is based on the classical Bradley-Terry model for the response outcomes and a multinomial model for the missing indicators. Different models for the two missing data mechanisms-missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing not at random (MNAR)-are then discussed and a blockwise composite link formulation is used to construct the likelihood. Additionally, an extension to account for dependence between the paired comparison items is introduced. The methodology is illustrated by a survey paired comparison experiment on five distinct teaching qualities of teachers. We show that there is little evidence of a MNAR process in this dataset. A discussion on the sizes of problems that can be fitted using this approach concludes the paper.","Bradley-Terry model,paired comparison data,multiple multinomial responses,composite link model,nonresponse model","INCOMPLETE CATEGORICAL-DATA,NONIGNORABLE NONRESPONSE,RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,OPTIMAL DESIGNS,BINARY DATA,MODELS,SUBJECT,DEPENDENCIES","Dittrich, Regina@Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Stat & Math, Vienna, Austria::Francis, Brian@Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster, England::Hatzinger, Reinhold@Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Stat & Math, Vienna, Austria::Katzenbeisser, Walter@Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Stat & Math, Vienna, Austria","Dittrich, Regina@Vienna University of Economics & Business::Francis, Brian@Lancaster University::Hatzinger, Reinhold@Vienna University of Economics & Business::Katzenbeisser, Walter@Vienna University of Economics & Business","Francis, Brian@A-1953-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7926-9085","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::A hybrid EM/Gauss-Newton algorithm for maximum likelihood in mixture distributions+Aitkin, M; Aitkin, I+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUN 1996::MARGINAL REGRESSION FOR REPEATED BINARY DATA WITH OUTCOME SUBJECT TO NON-IGNORABLE NONRESPONSE+BAKER, SG+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1995::Modeling within-subject dependencies in ordinal paired comparison data+Bockenholt, U; Dillon, WR+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1997::RANK ANALYSIS OF INCOMPLETE BLOCK DESIGNS .1.

Bayesian latent structure models with space-time dependent covariates,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001200202,APR 2012,46,2,"Spatial-temporal data requires flexible regression models which can model the dependence of responses on space- and time-dependent covariates. In this paper, we describe a semiparametric space-time model from a Bayesian perspective. Nonlinear time dependence of covariates and the interactions among the covariates are constructed by local linear and piecewise linear models, allowing for more flexible orientation and position of the covariate plane by using time-varying basis functions. Space-varying covariate linkage coefficients are also incorporated to allow for the variation of space structures across the geographical location. The formulation accommodates uncertainty in the number and locations of the piecewise basis functions to characterize the global effects, spatially structured and unstructured random effects in relation to covariates. The proposed approach relies on variable selection-type mixture priors for uncertainty in the number and locations of basis functions and in the space-varying linkage coefficients. A simulation example is presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach with the competing models. A real data example is used for illustration.","Bayesian regression,latent structure model,piecewise linear splines,space-time models,variable selection","ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES,COEFFICIENT MODELS,VARIABLE SELECTION,DISEASE RISK","Cai, Bo@Univ S Carolina, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Columbia, SC 29208 USA::Lawson, Andrew B.@Med Univ S Carolina, Div Biostat & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA::Hossain, Md Monir@Univ Texas Houston, Ctr Clin & Translat Sci, Houston, TX USA::Choi, Jungsoon@Med Univ S Carolina, Div Biostat & Epidemiol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA","Cai, Bo@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina System::Lawson, Andrew B.@Medical University of South Carolina::Hossain, Md Monir@University of Texas System@University of Texas Health Science Center Houston::Choi, Jungsoon@Medical University of South Carolina","Hossain, Md@N-5360-2015::Choi, Jungsoon@L-1944-2016","Space varying coefficient models for small area data+Assuncao, RM+ENVIRONMETRICS+AUG 2003::A Bayesian space varying parameter model applied to estimating fertility schedules+Assuncao, RM; Potter, JE; Cavenaghi, SM+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 30 2002::Coregionalized single- and multiresolution spatially varying growth curve modeling with application to weed growth+Banerjee, Sudipto; Johnson, Gregg A.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2006::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::Bayesian adaptive regression splines for hierarchical data+Bigelow, Jamie L.; Dunson, David B.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2007::Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics: A comparative review+Cowles, MK; Carlin, BP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::Empirical Bayes vs. fully Bayes variable selection+Cui, Wen; George, Edward I.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+APR 1 2008::no title+Denison, D; Holmes, C; Malick, B<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Smith, A</span>.+Bayesian methods for nonlinear classification and regression+2002::Bayesian approach for nonlinear random effects models+Dey, DK; Chen, MH; Chang, H+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1997::Bayesian model specification+Draper, D; Krnjajic, M.+Technical report+2006::Space-time models with time-dependent covariates for the analysis of the temporal lag between socioeconomic factors and lung cancer mortality+Dreassi, E; Biggeri, A; Catelan, D+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 30 2005::MULTIVARIATE ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES+FRIEDMAN, JH+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1991::Space-varying regression models: specifications and simulation+Gamerman, D; Moreira, ARB; Rue, H+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 28 2003::ON PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BINARY TRIALS+GEISSER, S+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1984::no title+Geisser, S.+Predictive Inference+1993::Model determination using predictive distributions with implementation via sampling-based methods+GELFAND, A.

Influence diagnostics for elliptical semiparametric mixed models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001200203,APR 2012,42,7,In this paper we extend semiparametric mixed linear models with normal errors to elliptical errors in order to permit distributions with heavier and lighter tails than the normal ones. Penalized likelihood equations are applied to derive the maximum penalized likelihood estimates (MPLEs) which appear to be robust against outlying observations in the sense of the Mahalanobis distance. A reweighed iterative process based on the back-fitting method is proposed for the parameter estimation and the local influence curvatures are derived under some usual perturbation schemes to study the sensitivity of the MPLEs. Two motivating examples preliminarily analyzed under normal errors are reanalyzed considering some appropriate elliptical errors.

A solution to separation for clustered binary data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001200102,FEB 2012,41,4,"The presence of one or more covariates that perfectly or almost perfectly predict the outcome of interest (which is referred to as complete or quasi-complete separation, the latter denoting the case when such perfect prediction occurs only for a subset of observations in the data) has been extensively studied in the last four decades. Since 1984, when Albert and Anderson (1984) differentiated between complete and quasi-complete separation, several authors have studied this phenomenon and tried to provide answers or ways of identifying the problem (Lesaffre and Albert, 1989; Firth, 1993; Christmann and Rousseeuw, 2001; Rousseeuw and Christmann, 2003; Allison, 2004; Zorn, 2005; Heinze, 2006). From an estimation perspective, separation leads to infinite coefficients and standard errors, which makes the algorithm collapse or give inappropriate results. As a practical matter, separation forces the analyst to choose from a number of problematic alternatives for dealing with the problem, and in the past the elimination of such problematic variables were common practice to deal with such situations. In the last decade, solutions using penalized likelihood have been proposed, but always dealing with independent binary data. Here we will propose a Bayesian solution to the problem when we deal with clustered binary data using informative priors that are supported by the data and compare it with an alternative procedure proposed by Gelman et al. (2008).","Separation issues,clustered binary data,logistic model,Bayesian analysis,conditional models,penalized likelihood approach","LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS,LINEAR MIXED MODELS,PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,NONINFORMATIVE PRIORS,RESPONSE MODELS,BAYES FACTORS,LIKELIHOOD,EXISTENCE,INFERENCE","Abrahantes, Jose Cortinas@European Food Safety Author EFSA, I-43126 Parma, Italy@Hasselt Univ Belgium, Ctr Stat, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat I BioSt, Hasselt, Belgium::Aerts, Marc@Hasselt Univ Belgium, Ctr Stat, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat I BioSt, Hasselt, Belgium","Abrahantes, Jose Cortinas@Hasselt University@European Food Safety Authority::Aerts, Marc@Hasselt University",not exist,"Salmonella serosurveillance: Different statistical methods to categorise pig herds based on serological data+Abrahantes, J.

Estimation of traffic matrices in the presence of long memory traffic,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001200103,FEB 2012,49,3,"The estimation of traffic matrices in a communications network on the basis of a set of traffic measurements on the network links is a well-known problem, for which a number of solutions have been proposed when the traffic does not show dependence over time, as in the case of the Poisson process. However, extensive measurements campaigns conducted on IP networks have shown that the traffic exhibits long range dependence. Here a method is proposed for the estimation of traffic matrices in the case of long range dependence, and its theoretical properties are studied. Its merits are then evaluated via a simulation study. Finally, an application to real data is provided.","network tomography,traffic estimation,self-similarity,long range dependence","CENTRAL-LIMIT-THEOREM,RANGE DEPENDENCE,SELF-SIMILARITY,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,NETWORK TOMOGRAPHY,TIME-SERIES,LINK DATA,INTERNET,FUNET","Conti, P.

Density estimation using non-parametric and semi-parametric mixtures,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001200104,FEB 2012,35,8,"This article presents a general framework for univariate non-parametric density estimation, based on mixture models. Similar to kernel-based estimation, the proposed approach uses bandwidth to control the density smoothness, but each density estimate for a fixed bandwidth is determined by non-parametric likelihood maximization, with bandwidth selection carried out as model selection. This leads to simple models, yet with higher accuracy, especially in terms of the Kullback-Leibler or the Hellinger risk. The particular problem of estimating a symmetric density function is investigated. Both simulation study and real-world data examples suggest that the mixture-based estimators outperform their kernel-based counterparts.","density estimation,symmetric distribution,non-parametric mixture,semi-parametric mixture,kernel-based estimation,bandwidth selection","BANDWIDTH SELECTION,MIXING DISTRIBUTION,MODELS","Wang, Yong@Univ Auckland, Dept Stat, Auckland 1142, New Zealand::Chee, Chew-Seng@Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Kuala Terengganu 21030, Terengganu, Malaysia","Wang, Yong@University of Auckland::Chee, Chew-Seng@Universiti Malaysia Terengganu",not exist,"no title+Bohning, D.+Computer-assisted Analysis of Mixtures and Applications: Meta-analysis, Disease Mapping and Others+2000::A REVIEW OF RELIABLE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ALGORITHMS FOR SEMIPARAMETRIC MIXTURE-MODELS+BOHNING, D+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 1995::The EM algorithm with gradient function update for discrete mixtures with known (fixed) number of components+Bohning, D+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+AUG 2003::Order Selection in Finite Mixture Models With a Nonsmooth Penalty+Chen, Jiahua; Khalili, Abbas+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2009::The symmetry of the wage-change distribution: Survey and contract data+Christofides, L.

Variational Bayesian inference and complexity control for stochastic block models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001200105,FEB 2012,37,32,"It is now widely accepted that knowledge can be acquired from networks by clustering their vertices according to the connection profiles. Many methods have been proposed and in this paper we concentrate on the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). The clustering of vertices and the estimation of SBM model parameters have been subject to previous work, and numerous inference strategies such as variational expectation maximization (EM) and classification EM have been proposed. However, SBM still suffers from a lack of criteria to estimate the number of components in the mixture. To our knowledge, only one model-based criterion, Integrated Complete-data Likelihood (ICL), has been derived for SBM in the literature. It relies on an asymptotic approximation of the integrated complete-data likelihood and recent studies have shown that it tends to be too conservative in the case of small networks. To tackle this issue, we propose a new criterion that we call Integrated Likelihood Variational Bayes (ILvb), based on a non-asymptotic approximation of the marginal likelihood. We describe how the criterion can be computed through a variational Bayes EM algorithm.","random graphs,stochastic block models,community detection,variational EM,variational Bayes EM,integrated complete-data likelihood,integrated observed-data likelihood","LATENT STRUCTURE,EM ALGORITHM,NETWORKS,BLOCKMODELS,MIXTURE,GRAPHS,PREDICTION,LIKELIHOOD","Latouche, P.@UEVE, Lab Stat & Genome, CNRS, UMR 8071, F-91000 Evry, France::Birmele, E.@UEVE, Lab Stat & Genome, CNRS, UMR 8071, F-91000 Evry, France::Ambroise, C.@UEVE, Lab Stat & Genome, CNRS, UMR 8071, F-91000 Evry, France","Latouche, P.@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Birmele, E.@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Ambroise, C.@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)",not exist,"Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels+Airoldi, Edoardo M.; Blei, David M.; Fienberg, Stephen E.; et al.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+SEP 2008::Statistical mechanics of complex networks+Albert, R; Barabasi, AL+REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS+JAN 2002::IDENTIFIABILITY OF PARAMETERS IN LATENT STRUCTURE MODELS WITH MANY OBSERVED VARIABLES+Allman, Elizabeth S.; Matias, Catherine; Rhode, John A.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2009::Inferring parameters and structure of latent variable models by Variational Bayes+Attias, H+UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, PROCEEDINGS+1999::Network biology: Understanding the cell's functional organization+Barabasi, AL; Oltvai, ZN+NATURE REVIEWS GENETICS+FEB 2004::Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2000::Exact and Monte Carlo calculations of integrated likelihoods for the latent class model+Biernacki, C.; Celeux, G.; Govaert, G.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 2010::no title+Boer, P.; Huisman, M.; Tom, A.

Bayesian first order auto-regressive latent variable models for multiple binary sequences,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100601,DEC 2011,18,4,Longitudinal clinical trials often collect long sequences of binary data monitoring a disease process over time. Our application is a medical study conducted in the US by the Veterans Administration Cooperative Urological Research Group to assess the effectiveness of a chemotherapy treatment (thiotepa) in preventing recurrence on subjects affected by bladder cancer. We propose a generalized linear model with latent auto-regressive structure for longitudinal binary data following a Bayesian approach. We discuss inference as well as sensitivity to prior choices for the bladder cancer data. We find that there is a significant treatment effect in the sense that treated patients have much smaller predicted recurrence probabilities than placebo patients.,"binary longitudinal data,first order auto-regressive model,hierarchical Bayesian modelling,latent variables","NONPARAMETRIC METHODS,PROBIT MODELS,PARAMETERS,REGRESSION,ORDER","Giardina, Federica@Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Basel, Switzerland::Guglielmi, Alessandra@Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Matemat, I-20133 Milan, Italy@CNR IMATI, Milan, Italy::Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile::Ruggeri, Fabrizio@CNR IMATI, Milan, Italy","Giardina, Federica@Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute@University of Basel::Guglielmi, Alessandra@Polytechnic University of Milan@Istituto di Matematica Applicata e Tecnologie Informatiche ""Enrico Magenes"" (IMATI-CNR)@Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)::Quintana, Fernando A.@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile::Ruggeri, Fabrizio@Istituto di Matematica Applicata e Tecnologie Informatiche ""Enrico Magenes"" (IMATI-CNR)@Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)","Ruggeri, Fabrizio@A-9383-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7655-6254::Giardina, Federica@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3710-0940","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::COMPARISONS OF PLACEBO PYRIDOXINE AND TOPICAL THIOTEPA IN PREVENTING RECURRENCE OF STAGE I BLADDER CANCER+BYAR D; BLACKARD C; VETERANS ADM COOP UROL RES GROUP+Urology+1977::Bayesian modeling of correlated binary responses via scale mixture of multivariate normal link functions+Chen, M-H; Dey, DK.+Sankhya: Indian J Stat Ser A+1998::Analysis of multivariate probit models+Chib, S; Greenberg, E+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1998::no title+CHIB S+GEN LINEAR MODELS BA+2000::NONPARAMETRIC METHODS FOR ANALYZING INCOMPLETE NONDECREASING REPEATED MEASUREMENTS+DAVIS, CS; WEI, LJ+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1988::Non-parametric methods for comparing multiple treatment groups to a control group, based on incomplete non-decreasing repeated measurements+Davis, CS+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 15 1996::no title+Diggle, P.; Heagerty, P.; Liang, K.

Hierarchical mixture models for biclustering in microarray data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100602,DEC 2011,33,2,"In the last few years, model-based clustering techniques have become widely used in the context of microarray data analysis. In this empirical context, a potential purpose for statistical approaches is the identification of clusters of genes that are co-expressed under subsets of experimental conditions. We discuss a hierarchical mixture model to combine advantages of allowing for dependence within gene clusters and for simultaneous clustering of genes and experimental conditions. Thanks to the adopted hierarchical structure, we may distinguish gene clusters from mixture components, where the latter may represent intra-cluster gene-specific extra-Gaussian departures. To cluster experimental conditions, instead, we suggest a suitable parameterization of component-specific means by using a binary row stochastic matrix representing condition membership. The performance of the proposed approach is discussed on both simulated and real datasets.","Hierarchical mixture model,biclustering,microarray data","GENE-EXPRESSION DATA,CLASSIFICATION,PATTERNS,SELECTION","Martella, F.@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Stat, I-00185 Rome, Italy::Alfo, M.@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Stat, I-00185 Rome, Italy::Vichi, M.@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Stat, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Martella, F.@Sapienza University Rome::Alfo, M.@Sapienza University Rome::Vichi, M.@Sapienza University Rome","Martella, Francesca@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9295-8598::Alfo', Marco@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7651-6052","Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays+Alon, U; Barkai, N; Notterman, DA; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+JUN 8 1999::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::BicAT: a biclustering analysis toolbox+Barkow, S; Bleuler, S; Prelic, A; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+MAY 15 2006::Clustering gene expression patterns+Ben-Dor, A; Shamir, R; Yakhini, Z+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY+FAL-WIN 1999::no title+CHENG Y+ISMB+2000::Editing systematic unity measure errors through mixture modelling+Di Zio, M; Guarnera, U.; Luzi, O.+Survey Methodology+2005::Comparison of discrimination methods for the classification of tumors using gene expression data+Dudoit, S; Fridlyand, J; Speed, TP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2002::Cluster analysis and display of genome-wide expression patterns+Eisen, MB; Spellman, PT; Brown, PO; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+DEC 8 1998::no title+GHAHRAMANI Z+CRGTR9618 U TOR+1996::Molecular classification of cancer: Class discovery and class prediction by gene expression monitoring+Golub, TR; Slonim, DK; Tamayo, P; et al.+SCIENCE+OCT 15 1999::Clustering with block mixture models+Govaert, G; Nadif, M+PATTERN RECOGNITION+FEB 2003::Discriminant analysis by Gaussian mixtures+Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::COMPARING PARTITIONS+HUBERT, L; ARABIE, P+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1985::Revealing modular organization in the yeast transcriptional network+Ihmels, J; Friedlander, G; Bergmann, S; et al.+NATURE GENETICS+AUG 2002::Consistent estimation of the order of mixture models+Keribin, C.+Sankhya+2000::Clustering based on a multilayer mixture model+Li, J+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2005::Gene selection for sample classification based on gene expression data: study of sensitivity to choice of parameters of the GA/KNN method+Li, LP; Weinberg, CR; Darden, TA; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+DEC 2001::no title+MAR JC+1 AS PAC BIOINF C AP+2003::Biclustering of gene expression data by an extension of mixtures of factor analyzers,+MARTELLA, F.; ALFO, M.; VICHI, M.+The international Journal of Biostatistics+2010::A mixture model-based approach to the clustering of microarray expression data+McLachlan, GJ; Bean, RW; Peel, D+BIOINFORMATICS+MAR 2002::The EM algorithm - An old folk-song sung to a fast new tune+Meng, XL; vanDyk, D+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1997::no title+Pearl, J.+Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference+1988::Biclustering algorithms for biological data analysis: A survey+Sara, C.

However, we expect that there will be more information when the two models are implemented simultaneously. This paper combines these two models to propose a VAR model with constraints. The model extracts the leading index and explores the reduced-rank structures simultaneously. In this study, theoretical results are presented, which include a necessary and sufficient condition for a transformation for parsimonious parameterizations and model identification, the maximum likelihood estimations and the likelihood ratio test. The empirical results for the analysis of famous US hog data using the proposed model display the unification of several results in the literature, revealing that the novel model is reasonable and works quite well.","index model,reduced-rank model,vector autoregressive model","MULTIPLE TIME-SERIES,PENA-BOX MODEL","Hu, Yu-Pin@Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Int Business Studies, Puli 545, Nantou, Taiwan","Hu, Yu-Pin@National Chi Nan University",not exist,"NESTED REDUCED-RANK AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS FOR MULTIPLE TIME-SERIES+AHN, SK; REINSEL, GC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1988::An extended portmanteau test for VARMA models with mixing nonlinear constraints+Arbues, Ignacio+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+SEP 2008::CANONICAL ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE TIME-SERIES+BOX, GEP; TIAO, GC+BIOMETRIKA+1977::Tests of rank in reduced rank regression models+Camba-Mendez, G; Kapetanios, G; Smith, RJ; et al.+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2003::no title+Hannan, E.

A default Bayesian approach for regression on extremes,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100606,DEC 2011,24,6,"A default Bayesian approach to predict extreme events in the presence of explanatory variables is presented. In the prediction model, covariates are introduced, using a non-homogenous Poisson-Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) point process, which allows for variation in the tail behaviour. The prior distribution proposed is based on a Jeffreys' rule for regression parameters, extending the results previously obtained for an independent and identically distributed random sample drawn from the GPD. Special attention is given to mean return levels as an important summarizer. Inference is performed approximately via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and the posterior distribution turns out to be relatively easy to be computed. The model is applied to two real datasets from meteorological applications.","extreme values,Jeffreys' prior,K-year return level,non-homogenous Poisson-GPD,Peaks Over the Threshold","GENERALIZED PARETO DISTRIBUTION,HURRICANE DAMAGES,UNITED-STATES,EXCEEDANCES,THRESHOLD,FIT","Cabras, Stefano@Univ Cagliari, Dept Math, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy::Eugenia Castellanos, Maria@Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Mostoles, Spain::Gamerman, Dani@Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Math, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Cabras, Stefano@University of Cagliari::Eugenia Castellanos, Maria@Universidad Rey Juan Carlos::Gamerman, Dani@Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro","Castellanos, Maria Eugenia@E-9851-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7920-2307::Cabras, Stefano@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6690-8378","Bayesian analysis of extreme events with threshold estimation+Behrens, CN; Lopes, HF; Gamerman, D+STATISTICAL MODELLING+OCT 2004::no title+Box, GEP; Tiao, GC.+Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis+1992::ON SPATIAL EXTREMES: WITH APPLICATION TO A RAINFALL PROBLEM+Buishand, T.

A flexible instrumental variable approach,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100607,DEC 2011,40,12,"Classical regression model literature has generally assumed that measured and unmeasured covariates are statistically independent. For many applications, this assumption is clearly tenuous. When unobservables are associated with included regressors and have an impact on the response, standard estimation methods will not be valid. This means that estimation results from observational studies, whose aim is to evaluate the impact of a treatment of interest on a response variable, will be biased and inconsistent in the presence of unmeasured confounders. One method for obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects when dealing with linear models is the instrumental variable (IV) approach. Linear models have been extended to generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs), and although IV methods have been proposed to deal with GLMs, fitting methods to carry out IV analysis within the GAM context have not been developed. We propose a simple but effective two-stage procedure for IV estimation when dealing with GAMs represented using any penalized regression spline approach and a correction procedure for confidence intervals. We explain under which conditions the proposed method works and illustrate its empirical validity through an extensive simulation experiment and a health study where unmeasured confounding is suspected to be present.","generalized additive model,instrumental variable,two-stage estimation approach,unmeasured confounding","BAYESIAN CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,GENERALIZED ADDITIVE-MODELS,HEALTH-INSURANCE,NONPARAMETRIC MODELS,REGRESSION,SERVICES,SPLINE,WEAK","Marra, Giampiero@UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England::Radice, Rosalba@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1, England","Marra, Giampiero@University College London@University of London::Radice, Rosalba@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine",not exist,"Efficient estimation of models with conditional moment restrictions containing unknown functions+Ai, CR; Chen, XH+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2003::The nonlinear two-stage least-squares estimator+Amemiya, T.+J Econ.+1974::THE CONCEPT OF RESIDUAL CONFOUNDING IN REGRESSION-MODELS AND SOME APPLICATIONS+BECHER, H+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 30 1992::Does aggressive care following acute myocardial infarction reduce mortality?

A note on a hierarchical interpretation for negative variance components,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100501,OCT 2011,27,9,"A lot has been said about the relationship between hierarchical models, such as linear mixed-effects models, and the marginal models they imply. Generally, there is a many-to-one map of hierarchical models onto a given marginal model. Additionally, in some cases, no obvious hierarchical model leads to a given marginal model. For example, it is commonly known that the random-intercepts model produces, marginally, a compound-symmetry model with non-negative intraclass correlation, whereas, on the other hand, a compound-symmetry model with negative intraclass correlation is not induced by a conventional random-intercepts model. We show here that it is still possible, and even intuitively appealing, to formulate hierarchical models inducing structure such as negative compound-symmetry correlation. Thus, the aim of this note is to further clarify the relationship between hierarchical and marginal models, enhancing appeal and establishing symmetry of the concepts. Consequences for interpretation and sensitivity analysis are discussed. The ideas are illustrated in three sets of data.","linear mixed model,marginal model,random effect","EMBRYONIC-DEVELOPMENT INVITRO,ONYCHOMYCOSIS,MICE","Molenberghs, Geert@Univ Hasselt, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Verbeke, Geert@Unknow","Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt University::Verbeke, Geert@Unknow","Verbeke, Geert@I-5587-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8430-7576","TOXICITY AND HEALTH THREATS OF PHTHALATE ESTERS REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE+AUTIAN J+Environmental Health Perspectives+1973::QUANTITATION OF RAT EMBRYONIC-DEVELOPMENT INVITRO - A MORPHOLOGICAL SCORING SYSTEM+BROWN, NA; FABRO, S+TERATOLOGY+1981::no title+Carlin, B; Louis, T.+Bayes and empirical Bayes methods for data analysis+1996::A 12-week treatment for dermatophyte toe onychomycosis: Terbinafine 250 mg/day vs, itraconazole 200 mg/day - A double-blind comparative trial+DeBacker, M; DeKeyser, P; DeVroey, C; et al.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY+JUN 1996::no title+Diggle, P.; Heagerty, P.; Liang, K.

Variable selection in partially linear wavelet models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100502,OCT 2011,37,3,"Variable selection is fundamental in high-dimensional statistical modelling, including non- and semiparametric regression. However, little work has been done for variable selection in a partially linear model (PLM). We propose and study a unified approach via double penalized least squares, retaining good features of both variable selection and model estimation in the framework of PLM. The proposed method is distinguished from others in that the penalty functions combine the l(1) penalty coming from wavelet thresholding in the non-parametric component with the l(1) penalty from the lasso in the parametric component. Simulations are used to investigate the performances of the proposed estimator in various settings, illustrating its effectiveness for simultaneous variable selection as well as estimation.","lasso,l(1) penalty,partially linear model,variable selection,wavelet estimation","GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION,ORACLE PROPERTIES,ADAPTIVE LASSO,SHRINKAGE,REGRESSION,COEFFICIENT,SMOOTHNESS,LIKELIHOOD","Ding, Huijuan@Katholieke Univ Leuven, ORSTAT, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Claeskens, Gerda@Katholieke Univ Leuven, ORSTAT, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Jansen, Maarten@Univ Libre Brussels, Dept Math, Brussels, Belgium@Univ Libre Brussels, Dept Comp Sci, Brussels, Belgium","Ding, Huijuan@KU Leuven::Claeskens, Gerda@KU Leuven::Jansen, Maarten@Universite Libre de Bruxelles",not exist,"MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD IDENTIFICATION OF GAUSSIAN AUTOREGRESSIVE MOVING AVERAGE MODELS+AKAIKE, H+BIOMETRIKA+1973::Wavelet regression for random or irregular design+ANTONIADIS, A; PHAM, D.

Estimation of stable CARMA models with an application to electricity spot prices,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100504,OCT 2011,21,18,"We discuss theoretical properties and estimation of continuous-time ARMA (CARMA) processes, which are driven by a stable Levy process. Such processes are very useful in a continuous-time linear stationary setup: they have a similar structure as the widely used ARMA models and provide all advantages of a continuous-time model. As an application we consider data from a deregulated electricity market. Here, we fit a CARMA(2,1) model to spot prices from the Singapore New Electricity Market. The quality of the estimates is assessed in a simulation study. The continuous-time modelling aims at a new pricing methodology for energy derivatives.","CARMA model,electricity prices,estimation of CARMA models,stable CARMA model,stable Levy process,stable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process","INFINITE VARIANCE,ARMA,STATIONARY","Garcia, Isabel@Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Math, Bochum, Germany::Klueppelberg, Claudia@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math Sci, D-85747 Garching, Germany@Tech Univ Munich, Inst Adv Study, D-85747 Garching, Germany::Mueller, Gernot@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math Sci, D-85747 Garching, Germany","Garcia, Isabel@Ruhr University Bochum::Klueppelberg, Claudia@Technical University of Munich::Mueller, Gernot@Technical University of Munich","Garcia Arboleda, Isabel Cristina@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0765-6155::Kluppelberg, Claudia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0189-2384","no title+Brockwell, P.

Generalized shared-parameter models and missingness at random,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100401,AUG 2011,46,10,"When data are incomplete, models are often catalogued according to one of the three modelling frameworks to which they belong: selection models (SeM), pattern-mixture models (PMM) and shared-parameter models (SPM). The missing data mechanism is conventionally classified as missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR). Under MCAR, measurement and missingness mechanism are independent, but that is not the case for MAR. The definition of MAR is in SeM terms. Molenberghs et al. (1998) provided a characterization for PMM. Here, MAR is characterized in the SPM framework, using an extended SPM class. A subfamily, satisfying the MAR condition, is studied in detail. Particular implications for non-monotone missingness as well as for longitudinal data subject to dropout are studied. It is indicated how SPM can be constrained such that dropout at a given point in time can depend on current and past, but not on future measurements. Although, a natural requirement, it is less easily imposed in the PMM and SPM frameworks than in the SeM case. Some of the models proposed are illustrated using a clinical trial in toenail dermatophyte onychomycosis.","available-case missing value restrictions,ignorability,missing at random counterpart,missing completely at random,missing non-future-dependent restrictions,non-future dependence,pattern-mixture model,selection model","PATTERN-MIXTURE MODELS,SURROGATE END-POINTS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,INCOMPLETE DATA,CLINICAL-TRIALS,LINEAR-MODEL,CD4 COUNTS,DROP-OUT,SURVIVAL,AIDS","Creemers, An@Univ Hasselt, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Hens, Niel@Univ Hasselt, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, CHERMID, Ctr Evaluat Vaccinat, WHO Collaborating Ctr,Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, Antwerp, Belgium::Aerts, Marc@Univ Hasselt, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium::Molenberghs, Geert@Univ Hasselt, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium::Verbeke, Geert@Univ Hasselt, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium::Kenward, Michael G.@London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Med Stat Unit, London, England","Creemers, An@Hasselt University::Hens, Niel@Hasselt University@University of Antwerp@World Health Organization::Aerts, Marc@Hasselt University::Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt University@KU Leuven::Verbeke, Geert@Hasselt University@KU Leuven::Kenward, Michael G.@University of London@London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","Hens, Niel@M-4445-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1881-0637::Verbeke, Geert@I-5587-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8430-7576","Bayesian analysis of realistically complex models+Best, NG;

Non-compliance in surgical patients with herniated lumbar discs: an application of an extended latent class model as selection model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X1001100402,AUG 2011,8,0,"In a recent observational study on a sample of patients with herniated lumbar discs who underwent physiotherapy, the recovery rate of those who chose physiotherapy rather than surgery, as recommended, was not appreciably different from that of the other patients, although their prognosis was worse. To investigate whether this finding was due to a confounding effect induced by unobserved features of the patients, we fit a latent class model for the joint distribution of compliance, participation rate and recovery, given the individual attitude (modelled as latent variable) and a set of covariates. The usual assumption of local independence is relaxed in favour of conditional association between the observed variables given the latent one. The results indicate that the latent classes may be interpreted as dividing the patients according to whether they are highly versus moderately motivated towards physiotherapy: conditionally on the covariates, the more motivated subjects attend a larger number of therapy sessions and benefit much more from the therapy. In addition, the fact that the proportion of less motivated patients among non-compliers is very small may be due to a self-selection mechanism, which may explain the surprisingly good performance of physiotherapy for these patients.","confounding,physiotherapy,self-selection",,"Forcina, Antonio@Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Econ Finanza & Stat, I-06100 Perugia, Italy::Giovagnoli, Alessandra@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy::Stanghellini, Elena@Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Econ Finanza & Stat, I-06100 Perugia, Italy","Forcina, Antonio@University of Perugia::Giovagnoli, Alessandra@University of Bologna::Stanghellini, Elena@University of Perugia","forcina, antonio@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5239-5495","Lumbar disc herniations - Surgical versus nonsurgical treatment+Awad, John N.; Moskovich, Ronald+CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH+FEB 2006::no title+BARTOLUCCI F+J AM STAT ASSOC+2006::The natural history of lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy+Benoist, M+JOINT BONE SPINE+MAR 2002::no title+BHATTACHARYA FJ+STAT MED+2006::Identifiability of extended latent class models with individual covariates+Forcina, Antonio+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 15 2008::no title+GIOVAGNOLI A+EFFICACIA FISIOTERAP+2010::no title+MILLETTE PC+SPINE+2001::A multiple-record systems estimation method that takes observed and unobserved heterogeneity into account+Stanghellini, E; van der Heijden, PGM+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2004"

Quantile regression: A short story on how and why,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X18759142,JUN-AUG 2018,30,3,"Quantile regression quantifies the association of explanatory variables with a conditional quantile of a dependent variable without assuming any specific conditional distribution. It hence models the quantiles, instead of the mean as done in standard regression. In cases where either the requirements for mean regression, such as homoscedasticity, are violated or interest lies in the outer regions of the conditional distribution, quantile regression can explain dependencies more accurately than classical methods. However, many quantile regression papers are rather theoretical so the method has still not become a standard tool in applications. In this article, we explain quantile regression from an applied perspective. In particular, we illustrate the concept, advantages and disadvantages of quantile regression using two datasets as examples.","quantile regression,tutorial article,additive regression models,gradient boosting","INFERENCE,MODELS,RISK","Waldmann, Elisabeth@Friedrich Alexander Univ, Dept Med Informat Biometry & Epidemiol, Erlangen, Germany","Waldmann, Elisabeth@University of Erlangen Nuremberg",not exist,"no title+Belitz, C; Brezger, A; Kneib, T<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lang, S; Umlauf, N</span>.+BayesX: Software for Bayesian inference in structured additive regression models+2013::The Case for Objective Bayesian Analysis+Berger, James+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Bayesian density regression+Dunson, David B.; Pillai, Natesh; Park, Ju-Hyun+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2007::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::no title+Fahrmeir, L; Kneib, T; Lang, S<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Marx, B:</span>.+Regression: models, methods and applications+2013::Penalized structured additive regression for space-time data: A Bayesian perspective+Fahrmeir, L; Kneib, T; Lang, S+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2004::Understanding child stunting in India: A comprehensive analysis of socio-economic, nutritional and environmental determinants using additive quantile regression+Fenske, N; Burns, J; Hothorn, T<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rehfuess, EA</span>.+PLOS One+2013::Identifying Risk Factors for Severe Childhood Malnutrition by Boosting Additive Quantile Regression+Fenske, Nora; Kneib, Thomas; Hothorn, Torsten+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2011::no title+Frisch, M.+Homo Faber+1959::no title+Hofner, B; Mayr, A; Fenske, N<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Schmid, M</span>.+gamboostLSS: Boosting methods for GAMLSS models.

A primer on Bayesian distributional regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X18759140,JUN-AUG 2018,47,3,"Bayesian methods have become increasingly popular in the past two decades. With the constant rise of computational power, even very complex models can be estimated on virtually any modern computer. Moreover, interest has shifted from conditional mean models to probabilistic distributional models capturing location, scale, shape and other aspects of a response distribution, where covariate effects can have flexible forms, for example, linear, non-linear, spatial or random effects. This tutorial article discusses how to select models in the Bayesian distributional regression setting, how to monitor convergence of the Markov chains and how to use simulation-based inference also for quantities derived from the original model parametrization.

Top-down transformation choice,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17748081,JUN-AUG 2018,19,4,"Simple models are preferred over complex models, but over-simplistic models could lead to erroneous interpretations. The classical approach is to start with a simple model, whose shortcomings are assessed in residual-based model diagnostics. Eventually, one increases the complexity of this initial overly simple model and obtains a better-fitting model. I illustrate how transformation analysis can be used as an alternative approach to model choice. Instead of adding complexity to simple models, step-wise complexity reduction is used to help identify simpler and better interpretable models. As an example, body mass index (BMI) distributions in Switzerland are modelled by means of transformation models to understand the impact of sex, age, smoking and other lifestyle factors on a person's BMI. In this process, I searched for a compromise between model fit and model interpretability. Special emphasis is given to the understanding of the connections between transformation models of increasing complexity. The models used in this analysis ranged from evergreens, such as the normal linear regression model with constant variance, to novel models with extremely flexible conditional distribution functions, such as transformation trees and transformation forests.","Transformation analysis,Conditional transformation model,conditional distribution function,conditional quantile function,distribution regression,stratified linear transformation model,body mass index",MODELS,"Hothorn, Torsten@Univ Zurich, Inst Epidemiol Biostat & Pravent, Hirschengraben 84, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland","Hothorn, Torsten@University of Zurich",not exist,"Random forests+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+OCT 2001::no title+no author+Die Schweizerische Gesundheitsbefragung 2012 in Kurze: Konzept, Methode, Durchfuhrung+2013::INFERENCE ON COUNTERFACTUAL DISTRIBUTIONS+Chernozhukov, Victor; Fernandez-Val, Ivan; Melly, Blaise+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2013::no title+Fahrmeir, L; Kneib, T; Lang, S<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Marx, B:</span>.+Regression: models, methods and applications+2013::The Bernstein polynomial basis: A centennial retrospective+Farouki, Rida T.+COMPUTER AIDED GEOMETRIC DESIGN+AUG 2012::no title+Hothorn, T.+mlt: Most Likely Transformations .

A generalized additive model approach to time-to-event analysis,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17748083,JUN-AUG 2018,47,2,"This tutorial article demonstrates how time-to-event data can be modelled in a very flexible way by taking advantage of advanced inference methods that have recently been developed for generalized additive mixed models. In particular, we describe the necessary pre-processing steps for transforming such data into a suitable format and show how a variety of effects, including a smooth nonlinear baseline hazard, and potentially nonlinear and nonlinearly time-varying effects, can be estimated and interpreted. We also present useful graphical tools for model evaluation and interpretation of the estimated effects. Throughout, we demonstrate this approach using various application examples. The article is accompanied by a new R-package called pammtools implementing all of the tools described here.","Cox model,time-varying coefficients,piece-wise exponential model,penalization,survival analysis,splines","LINEAR-MODELS,REGULARIZATION PATHS,SMOOTHING PARAMETER,COORDINATE DESCENT,REGRESSION-MODELS,SURVIVAL-DATA,SELECTION,LASSO","Bender, Andreas@Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Stat, Munich, Germany::Groll, Andreas@Georg August Univ Gottingen, Stat, Gottingen, Germany@Georg August Univ Gottingen, Econometr, Gottingen, Germany::Scheipl, Fabian@Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Stat, Munich, Germany","Bender, Andreas@University of Munich::Groll, Andreas@University of Gottingen::Scheipl, Fabian@University of Munich","Bender, Andreas@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5628-8611","no title+Andersen, PK; Borgan, O; Gill, R<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Keiding, N</span>.+Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes+1992::Analysis of Time to Event Outcomes in Randomized Controlled Trials by Generalized Additive Models+Argyropoulos, Christos; Unruh, Mark L.+PLOS ONE+APR 23 2015::Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4+Bates, Douglas; Maechler, Martin; Bolker, Benjamin M.; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+OCT 2015::no title+Bender, A; Scheipl, F.+adibender/pammtools: v0.0.3.2 (Version v0.0.3.2)+November 14 2017::no title+Bender, A; Groll, A; Scheipl, F.+adibender/pammtutorial-smj: Release v1.0.1 (Version v1.0.1)+2018::Modeling exposure-lag-response associations with penalized piece-wise exponential models+Bender, A; Scheipl, F; Kuchenhoff, H<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Day, AG; Hartl, W</span>.+Technical report 108+2016::Semiparametric regression for discrete time-to-event data+Berger, Moritz; Schmid, Matthias+STATISTICAL MODELLING+JUN-AUG 2018::FITTING A GENERAL FAMILY OF FAILURE-TIME DISTRIBUTIONS USING GLIM+CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1983::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::Estimating the grid of time-points for the piecewise exponential model+Demarqui, Fabio N.; Loschi, Rosangela H.; Colosimo, Enrico A.+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 2008::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Hazard smoothing with B-splines+Eilers, PHC.+P 13 INT WORKSH STAT+1998::no title+Fox, J.; Weisberg, S.+An R Companion to Applied Regression+2011::Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent+Friedman, Jerome; Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Rob+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+FEB 2010::PIECEWISE EXPONENTIAL MODELS FOR SURVIVAL-DATA WITH COVARIATES+FRIEDMAN, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::no title+Frumento, P.+pch: Piecewise constant hazards models for censored and truncated data .

Collections of time series as well as 2D or 3D images can be considered as functional responses. We provide a hands-on introduction for a flexible semiparametric approach for function-on-scalar regression, using spatially referenced time series of ground velocity measurements from large-scale simulated earthquake data as a running example. We discuss important practical considerations and challenges in the modelling process and outline best practices. The outline of our approach is complemented by comprehensive R code, freely available in the online appendix.

Boosting for statistical modelling: A non-technical introduction,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17748086,JUN-AUG 2018,44,5,"Boosting algorithms were originally developed for machine learning but were later adapted to estimate statistical models-offering various practical advantages such as automated variable selection and implicit regularization of effect estimates. The interpretation of the resulting models, however, remains the same as if they had been fitted by classical methods. Boosting, hence, allows to use an advanced machine learning scheme to estimate various types of statistical models. This tutorial aims to highlight how boosting can be used for semi-parametric modelling, what practical implications follow from the design of the algorithm and what kind of drawbacks data analysts have to expect. We illustrate the application of boosting in the analysis of a stunting score from children in India and a high-dimensional dataset of tumour DNA to develop a biomarker for the occurrence of metastases in breast cancer patients.","variable selection,high-dimensional data,model choice,statistical learning","VARIABLE SELECTION,REGRESSION-MODELS,ADDITIVE-MODELS,R PACKAGE,ALGORITHMS,MALNUTRITION,PREDICTION,EVOLUTION,LOCATION,SPLINES","Mayr, Andreas@Ludwig Maxilians Univ, Inst Stat, Munich, Germany@Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Inst Med Informat Biometrie & Epidemiol, Erlangen, Germany::Hofner, Benjamin@Paul Ehrlich Inst, Langen, Germany","Mayr, Andreas@University of Erlangen Nuremberg@University of Munich::Hofner, Benjamin@Paul Ehrlich Institute",not exist,"no title+Arnold, F;

Identifying crash risk factors and high risk locations on an interstate network,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17722072,APR 2018,37,0,"Highway safety improvement projects are identified by using either (i) a site-specific or (ii) a systemic approach. In the site-specific approach, locations for improvements are ranked according to different performance measures such as critical crash rate, expected crash rate or equivalent property damage only. Alternatively, in the systemic approach, roadway characteristics such as number of lanes, shoulder width, etc. are flagged as a risk' (or preventative') feature that increases (decreases) the risk of negative outcomes. Using the Highway Safety Information System database, we seek to merge the two approaches by, first, identifying roadway factors associated with an increased occurrence of car crashes (features we call risk factors') and, subsequently, identifying roadway segments with a higher crash risk. Specifically, we model the locations of crashes as a realization from a spatial point process. We then parameterize the associated intensity surface of this spatial point process as the sum of a regression on roadway characteristics and spatially correlated error terms. Thus, through the regression piece, we identify hazardous roadway features and through the spatially correlated error terms, we identify locations of high risk.","Bayesian,Gaussian process,Highway Safety Information System,Point process,spatial statistics","SPATIAL CORRELATION,MODELS,POISSON,GEOSTATISTICS,ALGORITHM,FREQUENCY,SEVERITY,SAFETY,FIT","Gibson, Kaitlin E.@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, 223 TMCB, Provo, UT 84602 USA::Heaton, Matthew J.@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, 223 TMCB, Provo, UT 84602 USA::Tass, E.

Bayesian models for data missing not at random in health examination surveys,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17722605,APR 2018,21,1,"In epidemiological surveys, data missing not at random (MNAR) due to survey nonresponse may potentially lead to a bias in the risk factor estimates. We propose an approach based on Bayesian data augmentation and survival modelling to reduce the nonresponse bias. The approach requires additional information based on follow-up data. We present a case study of smoking prevalence using FINRISK data collected between 1972 and 2007 with a follow-up to the end of 2012 and compare it to other commonly applied missing at random (MAR) imputation approaches. A simulation experiment is carried out to study the validity of the approaches. Our approach appears to reduce the nonresponse bias substantially, whereas MAR imputation was not successful in bias reduction.","Bayesian estimation,Data augmentation,follow-up data,health examination surveys,multiple imputation,survival analysis","POPULATION,MORTALITY,PREVALENCE,SMOKING,TRENDS","Kopra, Juho@Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Math & Stat, POB 35 MaD, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland::Karvanen, Juha@Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Math & Stat, POB 35 MaD, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland::Harkanen, Tommi@Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Helsinki, Finland","Kopra, Juho@University of Jyvaskyla::Karvanen, Juha@University of Jyvaskyla::Harkanen, Tommi@Finland National Institute for Health & Welfare",not exist,"General methods for monitoring convergence of iterative simulations+Brooks, SP; Gelman, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 1998::Iterated importance sampling in missing data problems+Celeux, G; Marin, JM; Robert, CP+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 1 2006::LUNG CANCER AND OTHER CAUSES OF DEATH IN RELATION TO SMOKING - A 2ND REPORT ON THE MORTALITY OF BRITISH DOCTORS+DOLL, R; HILL, AB+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+1956::An adaptive Metropolis algorithm+Haario, H; Saksman, E; Tamminen, J+BERNOULLI+APR 2001::Non-participation and mortality in different socioeconomic groups: the FINRISK population surveys in 1972-92+Harald, Kennet; Salomaa, Veikko; Jousilahti, Pekka; et al.+JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH+MAY 2007::Total and cause specific mortality among participants and non-participants of population based health surveys: a comprehensive follow up of 54,372 Finnish men and women+Jousilahti, P; Salomaa, V; Kuulasmaa, K; et al.+JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH+APR 2005::Selection bias was reduced by recontacting nonparticipants+Karvanen, Juha; Tolonen, Hanna; Harkanen, Tommi; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+AUG 2016::Study Design in Causal Models+Karvanen, Juha+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2015::Correcting for non-ignorable missingness in smoking trends+Kopra, Juho; Harkanen, Tommi; Tolonen, Hanna; et al.+STAT+2015::no title+Laatikainen, T; Tapanainen, H; Alfthan, G<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Salminen, I; Sundvall, J; Leiviska, J; Harald, K; Jousilahti, P; Salomaa, V; Vartiainen, E</span>.+FINRISKI 2002: Tutkimuksen toteutus ja tulokset+2003::Global burden of COPD: risk factors, prevalence, and future trends+Mannino, David M.; Buist, A.

Estimation for finite mixture of simplex models: applications to biomedical data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17722607,APR 2018,35,0,"Simplex distribution has been proved useful for modelling double-bounded variables in data directly. Yet, it is not sufficient for multimodal distributions. This article addresses the problem of estimating a density when data is restricted to the (0,1) interval and contains several modes. Particularly, we propose a simplex mixture model approach to model this kind of data. In order to estimate the parameters of the model, an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is developed. The parameter estimation performance is evaluated through simulation studies. Models are explored using two real datasets: i) gene expressions data of patients' survival times and the relation to adenocarcinoma and ii) magnetic resonant images (MRI) with a view in segmentation. In the latter case, given that data contains zeros, the main model is modified to consider the zero-inflated setting.","simplex distribution,Finite mixture,zero-inflated models,simulation,EM algorithm,MRI","DISPERSION MODELS,BETA,REGRESSION,EQUATIONS","Lopez Quintero, Freddy Omar@Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Matemat, Ave Espana 1680, Valparaiso 2390123, Chile::Contreras-Reyes, Javier E.@Inst Fomento Pesquero, Div Invest Pesquera, Valparaiso, Chile@Univ Valparaiso, Inst Estadist, Valparaiso, Chile","Lopez Quintero, Freddy Omar@Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria::Contreras-Reyes, Javier E.@Universidad de Valparaiso","Contreras-Reyes, Javier@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1172-5456","no title+Andrade, ACGd.+Efeitos da especificacAo incorreta da funcAo de ligacAo no modelo de regressAo beta+2007::Longitudinal data estimating equations for dispersion models+Artes, R; Jorgensen, B+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2000::Finite mixtures of unimodal beta and gamma densities and the -bumps algorithm+Bagnato, Luca; Punzo, Antonio+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+AUG 2013::SOME PARAMETRIC MODELS ON THE SIMPLEX+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, OE; JORGENSEN, B+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 1991::A New Robust Regression Model for Proportions+Bayes, Cristian L.; Bazan, Jorge L.; Garcia, Catalina+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2012::no title+Bishop, CM.+Pattern recognition and machine learning+2006::no title+Burnham, K.

In order to study the sensitivity of the penalized estimates under some usual perturbation schemes in the model or data, the local influence curvatures are derived and some diagnostic graphics are proposed.

Effect fusion using model-based clustering,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17739058,APR 2018,43,0,"In social and economic studies many of the collected variables are measured on a nominal scale, often with a large number of categories. The definition of categories can be ambiguous and different classification schemes using either a finer or a coarser grid are possible. Categorization has an impact when such a variable is included as covariate in a regression model: a too fine grid will result in imprecise estimates of the corresponding effects, whereas with a too coarse grid important effects will be missed, resulting in biased effect estimates and poor predictive performance. To achieve an automatic grouping of the levels of a categorical covariate with essentially the same effect, we adopt a Bayesian approach and specify the prior on the level effects as a location mixture of spiky Normal components. Model-based clustering of the effects during MCMC sampling allows to simultaneously detect categories which have essentially the same effect size and identify variables with no effect at all.

Stochastic variable selection strategies for zero-inflated models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17711068,FEB 2018,37,0,"When count data exhibit excess zero, that is more zero counts than a simpler parametric distribution can model, the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) or zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models are often used. Variable selection for these models is even more challenging than for other regression situations because the availability of p covariates implies 4(p) possible models. We adapt to zero-inflated models an approach for variable selection that avoids the screening of all possible models. This approach is based on a stochastic search through the space of all possible models, which generates a chain of interesting models. As an additional novelty, we propose three ways of extracting information from this rich chain and we compare them in two simulation studies, where we also contrast our approach with regularization (penalized) techniques available in the literature. The analysis of a typical dataset that has motivated our research is also presented, before concluding with some recommendations.","excess zeros,ZI model,Hurdle model,variable selection,stochastic search","COUNT DATA,HEALTH-CARE,POISSON REGRESSION,CROSS-VALIDATION,MONTE-CARLO,DEMAND,EM","Cantoni, Eva@Univ Geneva, Res Ctr Stat, 40 Bd Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland@Univ Geneva, Geneva Sch Econ & Management, 40 Bd Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland::Auda, Marie@Univ Geneva, Res Ctr Stat, 40 Bd Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland@Univ Geneva, Geneva Sch Econ & Management, 40 Bd Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Cantoni, Eva@University of Geneva::Auda, Marie@University of Geneva",not exist,"Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike+1998::Optimal predictive model selection+Barbieri, MM; Berger, JO+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::Generalized additive modelling and zero inflated count data+Barry, SC; Welsh, AH+ECOLOGICAL MODELLING+NOV 30 2002::no title+Burnham, K.

Extended Poisson-Tweedie: Properties and regression models for count data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17715718,FEB 2018,35,0,"We propose a new class of discrete generalized linear models based on the class of Poisson-Tweedie factorial dispersion models with variance of the form mu + phi mu(p), where mu is the mean and phi and p are the dispersion and Tweedie power parameters, respectively. The models are fitted by using an estimating function approach obtained by combining the quasi-score and Pearson estimating functions for the estimation of the regression and dispersion parameters, respectively. This provides a flexible and efficient regression methodology for a comprehensive family of count models including Hermite, Neyman Type A, Polya-Aeppli, negative binomial and Poisson-inverse Gaussian. The estimating function approach allows us to extend the Poisson-Tweedie distributions to deal with underdispersed count data by allowing negative values for the dispersion parameter phi. Furthermore, the Poisson-Tweedie family can automatically adapt to highly skewed count data with excessive zeros, without the need to introduce zero-inflated or hurdle components, by the simple estimation of the power parameter. Thus, the proposed models offer a unified framework to deal with under-, equi-, overdispersed, zero-inflated and heavy-tailed count data. The computational implementation of the proposed models is fast, relying only on a simple Newton scoring algorithm. Simulation studies showed that the estimating function approach provides unbiased and consistent estimators for both regression and dispersion parameters. We highlight the ability of the Poisson-Tweedie distributions to deal with count data through a consideration of dispersion, zero-inflated and heavy tail indices, and illustrate its application with four data analyses. We provide an R implementation and the datasets as supplementary materials.","count data,Estimating functions,overdispersion,underdispersion,Poisson-Tweedie distribution","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,ESTIMATING EQUATIONS,DISPERSION MODELS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,ASYMPTOTICS,RADIATION,FAMILY","Bonat, Wagner H.@Univ Fed Parana, Dept Stat, Lab Stat & Geoinformat, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil@Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Odense, Denmark::Jorgensen, Bent@Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Odense, Denmark::Kokonendji, Celestin C.@Bourgogne Franche Comte Univ, Lab Math Besancon, Besancon, France::Hinde, John@Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Math Stat & Appl Math, Galway, Ireland::Demetrio, Clarice G.

Robust mixtures of factor analysis models using the restricted multivariate skew-t distribution,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17718119,FEB 2018,51,0,"This article introduces a robust extension of the mixture of factor analysis models based on the restricted multivariate skew-t distribution, called mixtures of skew-t factor analysis (MSTFA) model. This model can be viewed as a powerful tool for model-based clustering of high-dimensional data where observations in each cluster exhibit non-normal features such as heavy-tailed noises and extreme skewness. Missing values may be frequently present due to the incomplete collection of data. A computationally feasible EM-type algorithm is developed to carry out maximum likelihood estimation and create single imputation of possible missing values under a missing at random mechanism. The numbers of factors and mixture components are determined via penalized likelihood criteria. The utility of our proposed methodology is illustrated through analysing both simulated and real datasets. Numerical results are shown to perform favourably compared to existing approaches.","model-based clustering,Factor analysis,heavy tails,missing values,rMST distribution,robustness","HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA,COMMON FACTOR ANALYZERS,VARIATIONAL INFERENCE,BAYESIAN MIXTURES,ALGORITHM,LIKELIHOOD,EXTENSION,ECM","Lin, Tsung-I@Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Inst Stat, Taichung 402, Taiwan@China Med Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Taichung 404, Taiwan::Wang, Wan-Lun@Feng Chia Univ, Dept Stat, Taichung 407, Taiwan::McLachlan, Geoffrey J.@Univ Queensland, Dept Math, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia::Lee, Sharon X.@Univ Queensland, Dept Math, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Lin, Tsung-I@China Medical University Taiwan@National Chung Hsing University::Wang, Wan-Lun@Feng Chia University::McLachlan, Geoffrey J.@University of Queensland::Lee, Sharon X.@University of Queensland","McLachlan, Geoffrey@A-1491-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5921-3145::Lin, Tsung-I@Q-3423-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3992-1128::Wang, Wan-Lun@P-9036-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0344-7954","no title+Aitken, A.+Proc.

Bayesian quantile regression analysis for continuous data with a discrete component at zero,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17719633,FEB 2018,34,0,"In this work, we propose a Bayesian quantile regression method to response variables with mixed discrete-continuous distribution with a point mass at zero, where these observations are believed to be left censored or true zeros. We combine the information provided by the quantile regression analysis to present a more complete description of the probability of being censored given that the observed value is equal to zero, while also studying the conditional quantiles of the continuous part. We build up a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method from related models in the literature to obtain samples from the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the suitability of the model to analyse this censoring probability with a simulated example and two applications with real data. The first is a well-known dataset from the econometrics literature about women labour in Britain, and the second considers the statistical analysis of expenditures with durable goods, considering information from Brazil.","asymmetric Laplace distribution,Bayesian quantile regression,Durable goods,left censoring,two-part model","LIMITED DEPENDENT-VARIABLES,MODEL,SELECTION","Santos, Bruno@Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Math & Stat, Dept Stat, Ave Ademar de Barros S-N, Salvador, BA, Brazil::Bolfarine, Heleno@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Math & Stat, Dept Stat, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Santos, Bruno@Universidade Federal da Bahia::Bolfarine, Heleno@Universidade de Sao Paulo",not exist,"Bayesian Elastic Net Tobit Quantile Regression+Alhamzawi, Rahim+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2016::Conjugate priors and variable selection for Bayesian quantile regression+Alhamzawi, Rahim; Yu, Keming+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 2013::Variable selection in quantile regression via Gibbs sampling+Alhamzawi, Rahim; Yu, Keming+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+2012::Bayesian Tobit quantile regression using g-prior distribution with ridge parameter+Alhamzawi, Rahim; Yu, Keming+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+SEP 22 2015::Use of log-skew-normal distribution in analysis of continuous data with a discrete component at zero+Chai, High Seng; Bailey, Kent R.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 15 2008::BAYES INFERENCE IN THE TOBIT CENSORED REGRESSION-MODEL+CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1992::SOME STATISTICAL MODELS FOR LIMITED DEPENDENT VARIABLES WITH APPLICATION TO DEMAND FOR DURABLE GOODS+CRAGG, JG+ECONOMETRICA+1971::AN EASILY IMPLEMENTED GENERALIZED INVERSE GAUSSIAN GENERATOR+DAGPUNAR, JS+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1989::The increasing intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones+Elsner, James B.; Kossin, James P.; Jagger, Thomas H.+NATURE+SEP 4 2008::no title+HARRIS T+AM STAT+1950::Beyond mean regression+Kneib, Thomas+STATISTICAL MODELLING+AUG 2013::Bayesian Endogenous Tobit Quantile Regression+Kobayashi, Genya+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+MAR 2017::Bayesian analysis of quantile regression for censored dynamic panel data+Kobayashi, Genya; Kozumi, Hideo+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+JUN 2012::REGRESSION QUANTILES+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1978::no title+Koenker, R.+Quantile Regression+2005::Gibbs sampling methods for Bayesian quantile regression+Kozumi, Hideo; Kobayashi, Genya+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2011::Spatial quantile multiple regression using the asymmetric Laplace process+Lum, K; Gelfand, A.+Bayesian Analysis+2012::Bayesian quantile regression for longitudinal data models+Luo, Youxi; Lian, Heng; Tian, Maozai+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2012::A mixture model with detection limits for regression analyses of antibody response to vaccine+Moulton, LH; Halsey, NA+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1995::THE SENSITIVITY OF AN EMPIRICAL-MODEL OF MARRIED WOMENS HOURS OF WORK TO ECONOMIC AND STATISTICAL ASSUMPTIONS+MROZ, TA+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1987::Regression Adjustment for Noncrossing Bayesian Quantile Regression+Rodrigues, T.; Fan, Y.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+2017::Bayesian analysis for zero-or-one inflated proportion data using quantile regression+Santos, Bruno; Bolfarine, Heleno+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2015::Posterior Consistency of Bayesian Quantile Regression Based on the Misspecified Asymmetric Laplace Density+Sriram, Karthik; Ramamoorthi, R.

Dynamic child growth prediction: Acomparative methods approach,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17707619,DEC 2017,27,0,"We introduce a class of dynamic regression models designed to predict the future of growth curves based on their historical dynamics. This class of models incorporates both baseline and time-dependent covariates, start with simple regression models and build up to dynamic function-on-function regressions. We compare the performance of the dynamic prediction models in a variety of signal-to-noise scenarios and provide practical solutions for model selection. We conclude that (a) prediction performance increases substantially when using the entire growth history relative to using only the last and first observation; (b) smoothing incorporated using functional regression approaches increases prediction performance; and (c) the interpretation of model parameters is substantially improved using functional regression approaches. Because many growth curve datasets exhibit missing and noisy data, we propose a bootstrap of subjects approach to account for the variability associated with the missing data imputation and smoothing. Methods are motivated by and applied to the CONTENT dataset, a study that collected monthly child growth data on 197 children from birth until month 15. R code describing the fitting approaches is provided in a supplementary file.","functional data,Function-on-function regression,functional regression,longitudinal data,height,weight","FUNCTIONAL DATA,PERUVIAN CHILDREN,LONGITUDINAL DATA,ADULT HEIGHT,BONE-AGE,REGRESSION","Ivanescu, Andrada E.@Montclair State Univ, Dept Math, Montclair, NJ USA::Crainiceanu, Ciprian M.@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biostat, 615 N Wolfe St,E3636, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA::Checkley, William@Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD USA","Ivanescu, Andrada E.@Montclair State University::Crainiceanu, Ciprian M.@Johns Hopkins University::Checkley, William@Johns Hopkins University",not exist,"Growth velocity assessment in paediatric AIDS: smoothing, penalized quantile regression and the definition of growth failure+Carey, VJ; Yong, FH; Frenkel, LM; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 15 2004::Effects of Cryptosporidium parvum infection in Peruvian children: Growth faltering and subsequent catch-up growth+Checkley, W; Epstein, LD; Gilman, RH; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+SEP 1 1998::Effects of nutritional status on diarrhea in Peruvian children+Checkley, W; Gilman, RH; Black, RE; et al.+JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS+FEB 2002::no title+Cheung,, Y.

Mean-parametrized Conway-Maxwell-Poisson regression models for dispersed counts,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17697749,DEC 2017,20,0,"Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distributions are flexible generalizations of the Poisson distribution for modelling overdispersed or underdispersed counts. The main hindrance to their wider use in practice seems to be the inability to directly model the mean of counts, making them not compatible with nor comparable to competing count regression models, such as the log-linear Poisson, negative-binomial or generalized Poisson regression models. This note illustrates how CMP distributions can be parametrized via the mean, so that simpler and more easily interpretable mean-models can be used, such as a log-linear model. Other link functions are also available, of course. In addition to establishing attractive theoretical and asymptotic properties of the proposed model, its good finite-sample performance is exhibited through various examples and a simulation study based on real datasets. Moreover, the MATLAB routine to fit the model to data is demonstrated to be up to an order of magnitude faster than the current software to fit standard CMP models, and over two orders of magnitude faster than the recently proposed hyper-Poisson model.","Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution,Count data,generalized linear model,overdispersion,underdispersion",GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,"Huang, Alan@Univ Queensland, Sch Math & Phys, St Lucia, Qld 4066, Australia","Huang, Alan@University of Queensland","Huang, Alan@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7848-6755","Count data regression using series expansions: With applications+Cameron, AC; Johansson, P+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+MAY-JUN 1997::GENERALIZED POISSON REGRESSION-MODEL+CONSUL, PC; FAMOYE, F+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1992::A queing model with state dependent service rates+Conway, RW; Maxwell, WL.+J Ind Eng+1962::no title+Croissant, Y.+Ecdat: Datasets for econometrics, R Package, version 0. 1-6. 1+2011::CONSISTENCY AND ASYMPTOTIC NORMALITY OF THE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR IN GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+FAHRMEIR, L; KAUFMANN, H+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1985::RESTRICTED GENERALIZED POISSON REGRESSION-MODEL+FAMOYE, F+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1993::A flexible count data regression model for risk analysis+Guikema, Seth D.; Goffelt, Jeremy P.+RISK ANALYSIS+FEB 2008::Orthogonality of the mean and error distribution in generalized linear models+Huang, Alan; Rathouz, Paul J.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2017::Application of the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson generalized linear model for analyzing motor vehicle crashes+Lord, Dominique; Guikema, Seth D.; Geedipally, Srinivas Reddy+ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION+MAY 2008::Extension of the Application of Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Models: Analyzing Traffic Crash Data Exhibiting Underdispersion+Lord, Dominique; Geedipally, Srinivas Reddy; Guikema, Seth D.+RISK ANALYSIS+AUG 2010::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::An empirical model for underdispersed count data+Ridout, MS; Besbeas, P+STATISTICAL MODELLING+APR 2004::A hyper-Poisson regression model for overdispersed and underdispersed count data+Saez-Castillo, A.

An application of Dirichlet process in clustering subjects via variance shift models: A course-evaluation study,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17699299,DEC 2017,51,0,"In this article, the Dirichlet process (DP) is applied to cluster subjects with longitudinal observations. The basis of clustering is the ability of subjects to adapt themselves to new circumstances. Indeed, the basis of clustering depends on the time of changing response variability. This is done by providing a random change-point time in the variance structure of mixed-effects models. The DP is assumed as a prior for the distribution of the random change point. The discrete nature of the DP is utilized to cluster subjects according to the time of adaption. The proposed model is useful to identify groups of subjects with distinctive time-based progressions or declines. Transition mixed-effects models are also used to account for the serial correlation among observations over time. A joint modelling approach is utilized to handle the bias created in these models. The Gibbs sampling technique is adopted to achieve parameter estimates. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated via conducting a simulation study. The usefulness of the proposed model is assessed on a course-evaluation dataset.","course-evaluation data,Dirichlet process prior,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Model-based clustering,transition mixed-effects models,variance shift models","BEHAVIOR-CHANGE,DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES,SAMPLING METHODS,MIXED MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS,SERIES,PRIORS,AGE","Rikhtehgaran, Reyhaneh@Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Math Sci, Esfahan 8415683111, Iran","Rikhtehgaran, Reyhaneh@Isfahan University of Technology",not exist,"Developmental trajectories of multisite musculoskeletal pain and depressive symptoms: The effects of job demands and resources and individual factors+Airila, Auli; Hakanen, Jari J.; Luukkonen, Ritva; et al.+PSYCHOLOGY &amp; HEALTH+2014::no title+[Anonymous].+MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release 2012b+2012::A Variance Shift Model for Detection of Outliers in the Linear Measurement Error Model+Babadi, Babak; Rasekh, Abdolrahman; Rasekhi, Ali Akbar; et al.+ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS+2014::Model-based clustering methods for time series+Bock, H-H.+German-Japanese Interchange of Data Analysis Results+2014::Comorbid Development of Disruptive Behaviors from age 1A1/2 to 5 Years in a Population Birth-Cohort and Association with School Adjustment in First Grade+Carbonneau, Rene; Boivin, Michel; Brendgen, Mara; et al.+JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2016::Behavior problems in elementary school among low-income boys: The role of teacher-child relationships+Collins, Brian Andrew; O'Connor, Erin Eileen; Supplee, Lauren; et al.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH+2017::A comparison of GEE and random effects models for distinguishing heterogeneity, nonstationarity and state dependence in a collection of short binary event series+Crouchley, R.; Davies, R.

Hysteretic Poisson INGARCH model for integer-valued time series,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17703855,DEC 2017,30,0,"This study proposes a new model for integer-valued time series-the hysteretic Poisson integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic (INGARCH) model-which has an integrated hysteresis zone in the switching mechanism of the conditional expectation. Our modelling framework provides a parsimonious representation of the salient features of integer-valued time series, such as discreteness, over-dispersion, asymmetry and structural change. We adopt Bayesian methods with a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme to estimate model parameters and utilize the Bayesian information criteria for model comparison. We then apply the proposed model to five real time series of criminal incidents recorded by the New South Wales Police Force in Australia. Simulation results and empirical analysis highlight the better performance of hysteresis in modelling the integer-valued time series.","time series of counts,Poisson INGARCH model,hysteresis,threshold Poisson INGARCH model,over-dispersion,Markov chain Monte Carlo","COUNT DATA,AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS,INTERVENTIONS,REGRESSION","Truong, Buu-Chau@Feng Chia Univ, Dept Stat, Taichung, Taiwan@Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Math & Stat, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam::Chen, Cathy W.

Estimation of partly linear additive hazards model with left-truncated and right-censored data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17705993,DEC 2017,48,0,"In this article, we consider an additive hazards semiparametric model for left-truncated and right-censored data where the risk function has a partly linear structure, we call it the partly linear additive hazards model. The nonlinear components are assumed to be B-splines functions, so the model can be viewed as a semiparametric model with an unknown baseline hazard function and a partly linear parametric risk function, which can model both linear and nonlinear covariate effects, hence is more flexible than a purely linear or nonlinear model. We construct a pseudo-score function to estimate the coefficients of the linear covariates and the B-spline basis functions. The proposed estimators are asymptotically normal under the assumption that the true nonlinear functions are B-spline functions whose knot locations and number of knots are held fixed. On the other hand, when the risk functions are unknown non-parametric functions, the proposed method provides a practical solution to the underlying inference problems. We conduct simulation studies to empirically examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed method and analyze a real dataset for illustration.","B-spline,left-truncation,linear and nonlinear effects,partly linear additive hazards model,right-censoring","EFFICIENT ESTIMATION,REGRESSION-ANALYSIS,RISK MODEL,TIME DATA,INFERENCE,ERRORS","Afzal, Arfan Raheen@Univ Calgary, Dept Math & Stat, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada::Dong, Cheng@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::Lu, Xuewen@Univ Calgary, Dept Math & Stat, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Afzal, Arfan Raheen@University of Calgary::Dong, Cheng@University of Missouri System@University of Missouri Columbia::Lu, Xuewen@University of Calgary",not exist,"no title+Aalen, O.+A model for nonparametric regression analysis of counting processes.+1980::An introduction to survival and event history analysis+Aalen, Odd O.; Borgan, Ornulf; Gjessing, Hakon K.+SURVIVAL AND EVENT HISTORY ANALYSIS: A PROCESS POINT OF VIEW+2008::COX REGRESSION-MODEL FOR COUNTING-PROCESSES - A LARGE SAMPLE STUDY+ANDERSEN, PK; GILL, RD+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::ASYMPTOTICS FOR SEMIPARAMETRIC ECONOMETRIC-MODELS VIA STOCHASTIC EQUICONTINUITY+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1994::Error variance estimation in semi-functional partially linear regression models+Aneiros, German; Ling, Nengxiang; Vieu, Philippe+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+JUL 3 2015::no title+Breslow, N; Day, N.+Statistical methods ancer research, vol 2.

Flexible multivariate nonlinear models for bioequivalence problems,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17706018,DEC 2017,24,0,"Modelling the concentration of a drug in the bloodstream over time is usually done using compartment models. In pharmacokinetic data, they turn into highly nonlinear mixed-effects models (NLMEMs) when we take the heterogeneity between subjects into account. Fitting of NLMEMs can be difficult and may involve complex algorithms, with convergence critically depending on the initial values and maybe requiring data transformations. In this article, we propose a flexible alternative to the usual parametric compartment models, inspired by the Multivariate SuperImposition by Translation and Rotation (MSITAR) model but adapted to be applicable in this new field. A fully parametric one-compartment NLMEM is considered for comparison. We make use of a Bayesian approach and illustrate the method on a real dataset where the interest lies in contrasting the average and individual bioequivalence of a test and reference formulation of an anti-hypertensive drug.","Bayesian modelling,Bioequivalence,nonlinear mixed-effects models,pharmacokinetics,SITAR model","MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,GROWTH","Willemsen, Sten P.@Erasmus MC, Dept Biostat, Wytemaweg 80,Room NA-2416,POB 2040, Rotterdam, Netherlands::Russo, Cibele M.@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Ciencias Matemat & Comp, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil::Lesaffre, Emmanuel@Erasmus MC, Dept Biostat, Wytemaweg 80,Room NA-2416,POB 2040, Rotterdam, Netherlands@Katholieke Univ Leuven, L BioStat, Leuven, Belgium::Leao, Dorival@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Ciencias Matemat & Comp, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Willemsen, Sten P.@Erasmus University Rotterdam@Erasmus University Medical Center::Russo, Cibele M.@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Lesaffre, Emmanuel@KU Leuven@Erasmus University Rotterdam@Erasmus University Medical Center::Leao, Dorival@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Inst Cien Matematicas Computacao, ICMC/USP@D-8320-2017","New approach to assess bioequivalence parameters using generalized gamma mixed-effect model (model-based asymptotic bioequivalence test)+Chen, Yuh-Ing; Huang, Chi-Shen+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 28 2014::SITAR-a useful instrument for growth curve analysis+Cole, Tim J.; Donaldson, Malcolm D.

When relative and absolute information matter: Compositional predictor with a total in generalized linear models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17710398,DEC 2017,30,2,"The analysis of compositional data (CoDa) consists in the study of the relative importance of parts of a whole rather than the size of the whole because absolute information is either unavailable or not of interest. On the other hand, when absolute and relative information are both relevant, research hypotheses concern both. This article introduces a model including both the logratios used in CoDa and a total variable carrying absolute information as predictors in an otherwise standard statistical model. It shows how logratios can be tailored to the researchers' hypotheses and alternative ways of computing the total. The interpretational advantages with respect to traditional approaches are presented and the equivalence and invariance properties are proven. A sequence of nested models is presented to test the relevance of relative and absolute information. The approach can be applied to dependent metric, binary, ordinal or count variables. Two illustrations are provided, the first on tourist expenditure and satisfaction and the second on solid waste management and floating population.","Compositional data,Generalized linear model,isometric logratio transformation,T-space","TOURIST EXPENDITURE COMPOSITION,DETERMINANTS,PATTERNS,ZEROS","Coenders, Germa@Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona, Spain::Martin-Fernandez, Josep A.@Univ Girona, Dept Comp Sci Appl Math & Stat, Girona, Spain::Ferrer-Rosell, Berta@Univ Lleida, Dept Business Adm, Lleida, Spain","Coenders, Germa@Universitat de Girona::Martin-Fernandez, Josep A.@Universitat de Girona::Ferrer-Rosell, Berta@Universitat de Lleida","Ferrer-Rosell, Berta@J-8552-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5554-0782::Coenders, Germa@A-4294-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5204-6882","The statistical analysis of compositional data+Aitchison, J.+MONOGRAPHS STAT APPL+1986::Dealing with zeros+Antoni Martin-Fernandez, Josep; Palarea-Albaladejo, Javier; Olea, Ricardo Antonio+COMPOSITIONAL DATA ANALYSIS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+2011::The mathematics of compositional analysis+Barcelo-Vidal, C.; Martin-Fernandez, J.A.+Aust.

"Statistical contributions to bioinformatics: Design, modelling, structure learning and integration",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17698255,AUG 2017,155,0,"The advent of high-throughput multi-platform genomics technologies providing whole-genome molecular summaries of biological samples has revolutionalized biomedical research. These technologiees yield highly structured big data, whose analysis poses significant quantitative challenges. The field of bioinformatics has emerged to deal with these challenges, and is comprised of many quantitative and biological scientists working together to effectively process these data and extract the treasure trove of information they contain. Statisticians, with their deep understanding of variability and uncertainty quantification, play a key role in these efforts. In this article, we attempt to summarize some of the key contributions of statisticians to bioinformatics, focusing on four areas: (1) experimental design and reproducibility, (2) preprocessing and feature extraction, (3) unified modelling and (4) structure learning and integration. In each of these areas, we highlight some key contributions and try to elucidate the key statistical principles underlying these methods and approaches. Our goals are to demonstrate major ways in which statisticians have contributed to bioinformatics, encourage statisticians to get involved early in methods development as new technologies emerge, and to stimulate future methodological work based on the statistical principles elucidated in this article and utilizing all available information to uncover new biological insights.","bioinformatics,epigenetics,experimental design,genomics,preprocessing,proteomics,regularization,reproducible research,statistical modelling","GENE-SET ANALYSIS,DNA COPY-NUMBER,COMPARATIVE GENOMIC HYBRIDIZATION,FUNCTIONAL MIXED MODELS,RETRACTED ARTICLE.

"The need for statistical contributions to bioinformatics at scale, with illustration to mass spectrometry",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17708519,AUG 2017,35,0,"In their article, Morris and Baladandayuthapani clearly evidence the influence of statisticians in recent methodological advances throughout the bioinformatics pipeline and advocate for the expansion of this role. The latest acquisition platforms, such as next generation sequencing (genomics/transcriptomics) and hyphenated mass spectrometry (proteomics/metabolomics), output raw datasets in the order of gigabytes; it is not unusual to acquire a terabyte or more of data per study. The increasing computational burden this brings is a further impediment against the use of statistically rigorous methodology in the pre-processing stages of the bioinformatics pipeline. In this discussion I describe the mass spectrometry pipeline and use it as an example to show that beneath this challenge lies a two-fold opportunity: (a) Biological complexity and dynamic range is still well beyond what is captured by current processing methodology; hence, potential biomarkers and mechanistic insights are consistently missed; (b) Statistical science could play a larger role in optimizing the acquisition process itself. Data rates will continue to increase as routine clinical omics analysis moves to large-scale facilities with systematic, standardized protocols. Key inferential gains will be achieved by borrowing strength across the sum total of all analyzed studies, a task best underpinned by appropriate statistical modelling.","computational statistics,sparse signal processing,mass spectrometry,proteomics,metabolomics","MS-BASED PROTEOMICS,PROTEIN QUANTIFICATION,LC-MS,ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS,LABEL-FREE,IDENTIFICATION,MODEL,NORMALIZATION,METABOLOMICS,FRAMEWORK","Dowsey, Andrew W.@Univ Bristol, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol, Avon, England@Univ Bristol, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Vet Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","Dowsey, Andrew W.@University of Bristol",not exist,"BLAME IT ON THE ANTIBODIES+Baker, Monya+NATURE+MAY 21 2015::Probabilistic Mixture Regression Models for Alignment of LC-MS Data+Befekadu, Getachew K.; Tadesse, Mahlet G.; Tsai, Tsung-Heng; et al.+IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS+SEP-OCT 2011::A flexible statistical model for alignment of label-free proteomics data - incorporating ion mobility and product ion information+Benjamin, Ashlee M.; Thompson, J.

Bayesian varying coefficient mixed-effects joint models with asymmetry and missingness,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16678543,JUN 2017,31,0,"Longitudinal and survival data are often collected from clinical studies. Mixed-effects joint models are commonly used for the analysis of such data. Nevertheless, the following issues may arise in longitudinal survival data analysis: (a) most joint models assume a simple parametric mixed-effects model for longitudinal outcome, which may obscure the important relationship between response and covariates; (b) clinical data often exhibits asymmetry so that symmetric assumption for model errors may lead to biased estimation of parameters; (c) response may be missing and missingness may be informative. There is little work concerning all of these issues simultaneously. We develop a Bayesian varying coefficient mixed-effects joint model with skewness and missingness to study the simultaneous influence of these features. The proposed methods are applied to an AIDS clinical data. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the method.","Bayesian inference,Competing risks,longitudinal data,varying coefficient mixed-effects models,missing data,proportional hazard models,asymmetric distribution,survival data","SKEW T-DISTRIBUTION,SURVIVAL-DATA,LONGITUDINAL MEASUREMENTS,NONIGNORABLE NONRESPONSE,BINARY RESPONSES,DISTRIBUTIONS,REGRESSION,OUTCOMES","Lu, Tao@Univ Nevada, Dept Math & Stat, Reno, NV 89557 USA::Cai, Chunyan@Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Ctr Clin & Translat Sci, Biostat Epidemiol Res Design Core, Houston, TX 77030 USA::Lu, Minggen@Univ Nevada, Sch Community Hlth Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA::Zhang, Jun@Shenzhen Univ, Inst Stat Sci, Coll Math & Stat, Shen Zhen Hong Kong Joint Res Ctr Appl Stat Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China::Dong, Guang-Hui@Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Prevent Med, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China::Wang, Min@Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Math Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Lu, Tao@University of Nevada Reno@Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE)::Cai, Chunyan@University of Texas System@University of Texas Health Science Center Houston::Lu, Minggen@University of Nevada Reno@Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE)::Zhang, Jun@Shenzhen University::Dong, Guang-Hui@Sun Yat Sen University::Wang, Min@Michigan Technological University","Zhang, Jun@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4332-5182::Wang, Min@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9233-7844","On fundamental skew distributions+Arellano-Valle, RB; Genton, MG+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+SEP 2005::Distributions generated by perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on a multivariate skew t-distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::Robust likelihood methods based on the skew-t and related distributions+Azzalini, Adelchi; Genton, Marc G.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2008::MARGINAL REGRESSION FOR REPEATED BINARY DATA WITH OUTCOME SUBJECT TO NON-IGNORABLE NONRESPONSE+BAKER, SG+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1995::A pattern-mixture model for longitudinal binary responses with nonignorable nonresponse+Birmingham, J; Fitzmaurice, GM+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2002::A Bayesian semiparametric joint hierarchical model for longitudinal and survival data+Brown, ER; Ibrahim, JG+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2003::The Muscatine children's obesity data reanalysed using pattern mixture models+Ekholm, A; Skinner, C+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1998::A joint model for longitudinal measurements and survival data in the presence of multiple failure types+Elashoff, Robert M.; Li, Gang; Li, Ning+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2008::no title+Eubank, R.

We introduce HINAR as a generalization of the classical Poisson-based INAR models whose innovations follow a Hermite distribution. In order to assess trends and seasonality in these time series, we fit different models with time-dependent parameters by specifying proper functions. Using real world examples, we illustrate how to estimate parameters by maximum likelihood and validate the fitted models. We also show a detailed method to forecast. Our proposed model supposes a good solution for studying discrete time series when the counts have many zeros, low counts and moderate overdispersion. This model has been applied to the analysis of fallen cattle registered at a local scale as part of the development of a veterinary syndromic surveillance system.","cattle fallen stock,Hermite distribution,INAR models,Time dependent coefficients,veterinary syndromic surveillance","MODELS,SERIES,DISTRIBUTIONS","Fernandez-Fontelo, Amanda@Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Matemat, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain::Fontdecaba, Sara@Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Barcelona, Spain::Alba, Anna@IRTA, Ctr Recerca Sanitat Anim CReSA, Campus UAB, Bellaterra, Spain@Univ Minnesota, Coll Vet Med, Dept Vet Populat Med, St Paul, MN 55108 USA::Puig, Pedro@Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Matemat, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Fernandez-Fontelo, Amanda@Autonomous University of Barcelona::Fontdecaba, Sara@Polytechnic University of Catalonia::Alba, Anna@University of Minnesota System@Autonomous University of Barcelona@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@IRTA::Puig, Pedro@Autonomous University of Barcelona","Puig, Pedro@K-4414-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6607-9642::FERNANDEZ-FONTELO, AMANDA@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0822-6915","Exploring the Surveillance Potential of Mortality Data: Nine Years of Bovine Fallen Stock Data Collected in Catalonia (Spain)+Alba, Anna; Dorea, Fernanda C.; Arinero, Lucas; et al.+PLOS ONE+APR 15 2015::AN INTEGER-VALUED PTH-ORDER AUTOREGRESSIVE STRUCTURE (INAR(P)) PROCESS+ALZAID, AA; ALOSH, M+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+JUN 1990::The integer-valued autoregressive (INAR()) model+Du, J.

We provide an analysis of the validity and efficiency of the model estimates for a number of payment populations and overpayment scenarios.

Subject-specific modelling of paired comparison data: A lasso-type penalty approach,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X17693086,JUN 2017,52,1,"In traditional paired comparison models heterogeneity in the population is simply ignored and it is assumed that all persons or subjects have the same preference structure. In the models considered here the preference of an object over another object is explicitly modelled as depending on subject-specific covariates, therefore allowing for heterogeneity in the population. Since by construction the models contain a large number of parameters we propose to use penalized estimation procedures to obtain estimates of the parameters. The used regularized estimation approach penalizes the differences between the parameters corresponding to single covariates. It enforces variable selection and allows to find clusters of objects with respect to covariates. We consider simple binary but also ordinal paired comparisons models. The method is applied to data from a pre-election study from Germany.","BTLLasso,Paired comparison,Bradley-Terry-Luce model,lasso,heterogeneity","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,BRADLEY-TERRY MODELS,VARIABLE SELECTION,ORACLE PROPERTIES,RIDGE-REGRESSION,LUCE MODELS,RESPONSES,PREDICTION,LIKELIHOOD,RANKINGS","Schauberger, Gunther@Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Stat, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Tutz, Gerhard@Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Stat, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Schauberger, Gunther@University of Munich::Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich",not exist,"ANALYSIS OF ORDINAL PAIRED COMPARISON DATA+AGRESTI, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1992::Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::L 1 penalized continuation ratio models for ordinal response prediction using high-dimensional datasets+Archer, K.

A general framework for functional regression modelling,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16681317,FEB 2017,113,4,"Researchers are increasingly interested in regression models for functional data. This article discusses a comprehensive framework for additive (mixed) models for functional responses and/or functional covariates based on the guiding principle of reframing functional regression in terms of corresponding models for scalar data, allowing the adaptation of a large body of existing methods for these novel tasks. The framework encompasses many existing as well as new models. It includes regression for generalized' functional data, mean regression, quantile regression as well as generalized additive models for location, shape and scale (GAMLSS) for functional data. It admits many flexible linear, smooth or interaction terms of scalar and functional covariates as well as (functional) random effects and allows flexible choices of basesparticularly splines and functional principal componentsand corresponding penalties for each term. It covers functional data observed on common (dense) or curve-specific (sparse) grids. Penalized-likelihood-based and gradient-boosting-based inference for these models are implemented in R packages <sans-serif>refund</sans-serif> and <sans-serif>FDboost</sans-serif>, respectively. We also discuss identifiability and computational complexity for the functional regression models covered.

Penalized complexity priors for degrees of freedom in Bayesian P-splines,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16659154,DEC 2016,31,3,"Bayesian penalized splines (P-splines) assume an intrinsic Gaussian Markov random field prior on the spline coefficients, conditional on a precision hyper-parameter tau. Prior elicitation of tau is difficult. To overcome this issue, we aim to building priors on an interpretable property of the model, indicating the complexity of the smooth function to be estimated. Following this idea, we propose penalized complexity (PC) priors for the number of effective degrees of freedom. We present the general ideas behind the construction of these new PC priors, describe their properties and show how to implement them in P-splines for Gaussian data.","Bayesian P-splines,degrees of freedom,penalized complexity priors,penalized spline regression","OGLIO RIVER,MODELS,SPECIFICATION,PENALTIES,INFERENCE","Ventrucci, Massimo .@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy::Rue, Havard@NTNU, Dept Math Sci, Trondheim, Norway","Ventrucci, Massimo .@University of Bologna::Rue, Havard@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)",not exist,"Nitrogen balance and fate in a heavily impacted watershed (Oglio River, Northern Italy): in quest of the missing sources and sinks+Bartoli, M.; Racchetti, E.; Delconte, C.

Sequential regression measurement error models with application,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16663065,DEC 2016,27,0,"Sequential regression approaches can be used to analyze processes in which covariates are revealed in stages. Such processes occur widely, with examples including medical intervention, sports contests and political campaigns. The naive sequential approach involves fitting regression models using the covariates revealed by the end of the current stage, but this is only practical if the number of covariates is not too large. An alternative approach is to incorporate the score (linear predictor) from the model developed at the previous stage as a covariate at the current stage. This score takes into account the history of the process prior to the stage under consideration. However, the score is a function of fitted parameter estimates and, therefore, contains measurement error. In this article, we propose a novel technique to account for error in the score. The approach is demonstrated with application to the sprint event in track cycling and is shown to reduce bias in the estimated effect of the score and avoid unrealistically extreme predictions.","logistic regression,measurement error,sequential regression,staged processes,track cycling","LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,COX REGRESSION,SIMULATION,MORTALITY,EVENTS,RULE","Moffatt, Joanne L.@Univ Salford, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England::Scarf, Phil@Univ Salford, Salford Business Sch, Salford, Lancs, England","Moffatt, Joanne L.@University of Salford::Scarf, Phil@University of Salford",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+MATLAB+2007::Bootstrap model selection had similar performance for selecting authentic and noise variables compared to backward variable elimination: a simulation study+Austin, Peter C.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+OCT 2008::no title+Carroll,, R.

Adding flexibility to Markov Switching models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16672025,DEC 2016,35,1,"Very often time series are subject to abrupt changes in the level, which are generally represented by Markov Switching (MS) models, assuming that the level is constant within a certain state (regime). This is not a realistic framework because in the same regime the level could change with minor jumps with respect to a change of state; this is a typical situation in many economic time series such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or the volatility of financial markets. We propose to make the state flexible, introducing a very general model which provides oscillations of the level of the time series within each state of the MS model; these movements are driven by a forcing variable. The new model allows for consideration of extreme jumps in a parsimonious way, without the adoption of a large number of regimes (in our examples the two-state MS models are used). Moreover, this model increases the interpretability and in particular the out-of-sample performance with respect to the most used alternative models. This approach can be applied in several fields, also using unobservable data. We show its advantages in three distinct applications, extending particular MS models, which involve macroeconomic variables, volatilities of financial markets and conditional correlations.","abrupt changes,goodness of fit,Hamilton filter,smoothed changes,time-varying parameters","AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY,ASSET RETURNS,REGIME,VOLATILITY,HETEROSCEDASTICITY,GARCH","Otranto, Edoardo@Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Piazza Pugliatti 1, I-98122 Messina, Italy@CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy","Otranto, Edoardo@University of Messina",not exist,"Modeling the Dependence of Conditional Correlations on Market Volatility+Bauwens, Luc; Otranto, Edoardo+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 2 2016::Multivariate Markov switching dynamic conditional correlation GARCH representations for contagion analysis+Billio, M; Caporin, M.+JISS+2005::Periodic autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity+Bollerslev, T; Ghysels, E+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1996::GENERALIZED AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY+BOLLERSLEV, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1986::Estimation and comparison of multiple change-point models+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 1998::COMPARING PREDICTIVE ACCURACY+DIEBOLD, FX; MARIANO, RS+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1995::Markov switching in GARCH processes and mean-reverting stock-market volatility+Dueker, MJ+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1997::Testing and Evaluating Dynamic Correlations for Asset Allocation+Engle, R.; Colacito, R.+Journal of Business and Economic Statistics+2006::Dynamic conditional correlation: A simple class of multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models+Engle, R+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2002::no title+Franses, Philip H; van Dijk, Dick.+Non-linear Time Series Models in Empirical Finance+2000::Forecasting realized volatility with changing average levels+Gallo, Giampiero M.; Otranto, Edoardo+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JUL-SEP 2015::ON THE RELATION BETWEEN THE EXPECTED VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF THE NOMINAL EXCESS RETURN ON STOCKS+GLOSTEN, LR; JAGANNATHAN, R; RUNKLE, DE+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+DEC 1993::Modeling the conditional distribution of interest rates as a regime-switching process+Gray, SF+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+SEP 1996::A new approach to Markov-switching GARCH models+Haas, M.; Mittnik, S.; Paolella, M.S.+Journal of Financial Econometrics+2004::Analysis of time series subject to changes in regime+Hamilton, J.D.+Econometrics+1990::A NEW APPROACH TO THE ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY TIME-SERIES AND THE BUSINESS-CYCLE+HAMILTON, JD+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1989::AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND CHANGES IN REGIME+HAMILTON, JD; SUSMEL, R+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP-OCT 1994::no title+Harvey, A.C.+Forecasting, structural time series models, and the Kalman filter+1990::Testing the equality of prediction mean squared errors+Harvey, D; Leybourne, S; Newbold, P+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JUN 1997::DYNAMIC LINEAR-MODELS WITH MARKOV-SWITCHING+KIM, CJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1994::Improving GARCH volatility forecasts with regime-switching GARCH+Klaassen, Franc+EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS+MAR 2002::MARKOV REGIME MODELS FOR MIXED DISTRIBUTIONS AND SWITCHING REGRESSIONS+LINDGREN, G+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1978::IS THE CORRELATION IN INTERNATIONAL EQUITY RETURNS CONSTANT - 1960-1990+LONGIN, F; SOLNIK, B+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+FEB 1995::no title+Markowitz, H.+Portfolio Selection: Efficient Diversification of Investments+1959::CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY IN ASSET RETURNS - A NEW APPROACH+NELSON, DB+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1991::Asset allocation using flexible dynamic correlation models with regime switching+Otranto, Edoardo+QUANTITATIVE FINANCE+2010::A time varying hidden Markov model with latent information+Otranto, Edoardo+STATISTICAL MODELLING+DEC 2008::Regime switching for dynamic correlations+Pelletier, D+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR-APR 2006::Model-Free Prediction and Regression: A Transformation-Based Approach to Inference+Politis, DN+MODEL-FREE PREDICTION AND REGRESSION: A TRANSFORMATION-BASED APPROACH TO INFERENCE+2015::No-VaS transformations: Flexible inference for volatility forecasting+Politis, DN; Thomakos, DD.+Recent Advances and Future Directions in Causality, Prediction, and Specification Analysis: Essays in Honor of Halbert L.

A multivariate single-index model for longitudinal data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16655633,OCT 2016,30,0,"Index measures are commonly used in medical research and clinical practice, primarily for quantification of health risks in individual subjects or patients. The utility of an index measure is ultimately contingent on its ability to predict health outcomes. Construction of medical indices has largely been based on heuristic arguments, although the acceptance of a new index typically requires objective validation, preferably with multiple outcomes. In this article, we propose an analytical tool for index development and validation. We use a multivariate single-index model to ascertain the best functional form for risk index construction. Methodologically, the proposed model represents a multivariate extension of the traditional single-index models. Such an extension is important because it assures that the resultant index simultaneously works for multiple outcomes. The model is developed in the general framework of longitudinal data analysis. We use penalized cubic splines to characterize the index components while leaving the other subject characteristics as additive components. The splines are estimated directly by penalizing nonlinear least squares, and we show that the model can be implemented using existing software. To illustrate, we examine the formation of an adiposity index for prediction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in children. We assess the performance of the method through a simulation study.","mixed effect model,multivariate setting,penalizing nonlinear least squares,P-spline,single-index model","QUASI-NEWTON METHODS,MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,DIMENSION REDUCTION,BLOOD-PRESSURE,ALGORITHMS,REGRESSION","Wu, Jingwei@Temple Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Coll Publ Hlth, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA::Tu, Wanzhu@Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Biostat, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Wu, Jingwei@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Temple University::Tu, Wanzhu@Indiana University System@Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis",not exist,"CONVERGENCE OF SINGLE-RANK QUASI-NEWTON METHODS+BROYDEN, CG+MATHEMATICS OF COMPUTATION+1970::The Relationship of Body Mass and Fat Distribution With Incident Hypertension Observations From the Dallas Heart Study+Chandra, Alvin; Neeland, Ian J.; Berry, Jarett D.; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY+SEP 9 2014::Bayesian analysis for penalized spline regression using WinBUGS+Crainiceanu, CM; Ruppert, D; Wand, MP+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+OCT 2005::Simple fitting of subject-specific curves for longitudinal data+Durban, M; Harezlak, J; Wand, MP; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 2005::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Comparison of the release of adipokines by adipose tissue, adipose tissue matrix, and Adipocytes from visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissues of obese humans+Fain, JN; Madan, AK; Hiler, ML; et al.+ENDOCRINOLOGY+MAY 2004::A NEW APPROACH TO VARIABLE METRIC ALGORITHMS+FLETCHER, R+COMPUTER JOURNAL+1970::Abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue compartments - Association with metabolic risk factors in the Framingham Heart Study+Fox, Caroline S.; Massaro, Joseph M.; Hoffmann, Udo; et al.+CIRCULATION+JUL 3 2007::A FAMILY OF VARIABLE-METRIC METHODS DERIVED BY VARIATIONAL MEANS+GOLDFARB, D+MATHEMATICS OF COMPUTATION+1970::OPTIMAL SMOOTHING IN SINGLE-INDEX MODELS+HARDLE, W; HALL, P; ICHIMURA, H+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1993::INVESTIGATING SMOOTH MULTIPLE-REGRESSION BY THE METHOD OF AVERAGE DERIVATIVES+HARDLE, W; STOKER, TM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1989::BEST LINEAR UNBIASED ESTIMATION AND PREDICTION UNDER A SELECTION MODEL+HENDERSON, CR+BIOMETRICS+1975::no title+Hinkle, D E; Wiersma, W; Jurs, S G.+Applied Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences+2003::SEMIPARAMETRIC LEAST-SQUARES (SLS) AND WEIGHTED SLS ESTIMATION OF SINGLE-INDEX MODELS+ICHIMURA, H+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1993::SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION FOR DIMENSION REDUCTION+LI, KC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1991::NEWTON-RAPHSON AND EM ALGORITHMS FOR LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS FOR REPEATED-MEASURES DATA+LINDSTROM, MJ; BATES, DM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1988::A statistical perspective on ill-posed inverse problems+O'Sullivan, F.

Bayesian dynamic modelling to assess differential treatment effects on panic attack frequencies,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16650777,OCT 2016,44,3,"To represent the complex structure of intensive longitudinal data of multiple individuals, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian Dynamic Model (BDM). This BDM is a generalized linear hierarchical model where the individual parameters do not necessarily follow a normal distribution. The model parameters can be estimated on the basis of relatively small sample sizes and in the presence of missing time points. We present the BDM and discuss the model identification, convergence and selection. The use of the BDM is illustrated using data from a randomized clinical trial to study the differential effects of three treatments for panic disorder. The data involves the number of panic attacks experienced weekly (73 individuals, 10-52 time points) during treatment. Presuming that the counts are Poisson distributed, the BDM considered involves a linear trend model with an exponential link function. The final model included a moving average parameter and an external variable (duration of symptoms pre-treatment). Our results show that cognitive behavioural therapy is less effective in reducing panic attacks than serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors or a combination of both. Post hoc analyses revealed that males show a slightly higher number of panic attacks at the onset of treatment than females.","time series analysis,longitudinal data,count data,multilevel models,missing data","AR(1) MODEL,DISORDER,THERAPY","Krone, Tanja@Univ Groningen, Fac Psychol, Dept Psychometr & Stat, Grote Kruisstr 2-1, NL-9712 TS Groningen, Netherlands::Albers, C.

Semi-parametric frailty model for clustered interval-censored data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16655631,OCT 2016,55,0,"The shared frailty model is a popular tool to analyze correlated right-censored time-to-event data. In the shared frailty model, the latent frailty is assumed to be shared by the members of a cluster and is assigned a parametric distribution, typically a gamma distribution due to its conjugacy. In the case of interval-censored time-to-event data, the inclusion of frailties results in complicated intractable likelihoods. Here, we propose a flexible frailty model for analyzing such data by assuming a smooth semi-parametric form for the conditional time-to-event distribution and a parametric or a flexible form for the frailty distribution. The results of a simulation study suggest that the estimation of regression parameters is robust to misspecification of the frailty distribution (even when the frailty distribution is multimodal or skewed). Given sufficiently large sample sizes and number of clusters, the flexible approach produces smooth and accurate posterior estimates for the baseline survival function and for the frailty density, and it can correctly detect and identify unusual frailty density forms. The methodology is illustrated using dental data from the Signal Tandmobiel (R) study.","Bayesian,interval censoring,P-splines,shared frailty","PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL,BAYESIAN P-SPLINES,FAILURE TIME MODEL,HETEROGENEOUS POPULATIONS,ERROR DISTRIBUTION,REGRESSION,DISTRIBUTIONS,ALGORITHMS","Yavuz, Aysun Cetinyurek@Univ Liege, Fac Sci Sociales, Pl Orateurs,3,Quartier Agora Bat B31, B-4000 Liege, Belgium::Lambert, Philippe@Univ Liege, Fac Sci Sociales, Pl Orateurs,3,Quartier Agora Bat B31, B-4000 Liege, Belgium@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium","Yavuz, Aysun Cetinyurek@University of Liege::Lambert, Philippe@Universite Catholique Louvain@University of Liege","Cetinyurek Yavuz, Aysun@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4024-8775","HETEROGENEITY IN SURVIVAL ANALYSIS+AALEN, OO+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 1988::Examples in which misspecification of a random effects distribution reduces efficiency, and possible remedies+Agresti, A; Caffo, B; Ohman-Strickland, P+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 2004::On adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms+Atchade, YF; Rosenthal, JS+BERNOULLI+OCT 2005::Analysis of clustered and interval censored data from a community-based study in asthma+Bellamy, SL; Yi, L; Ryan, LM; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 15 2004::Hazard regression for interval-censored data with penalized spline+Cai, TX; Betensky, RA+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2003::A Monte Carlo EM algorithm for generalized linear mixed models with flexible random effects distribution+Chen, JL; Zhang, DW; Davidian, M+BIOSTATISTICS+SEP 2002::The semi-parametric Pareto model for regression analysis of survival times+Clayton, D; Cuzick, J.+Proceedings of the Centenary Session of the International Statistical Institute+1985::MODEL FOR ASSOCIATION IN BIVARIATE LIFE TABLES AND ITS APPLICATION IN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL-STUDIES OF FAMILIAL TENDENCY IN CHRONIC DISEASE INCIDENCE+CLAYTON, DG+BIOMETRIKA+1978::Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics: A comparative review+Cowles, MK; Carlin, BP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::III-posed problems with counts, the composite link model and penalized likelihood+Eilers, Paul H.

Multi-state regression models taking competing risks into account are a good example of suitable approaches. In this work, multi-state structured additive regression (STAR) models combined with penalized splines (P-splines) are proposed to evaluate peritoneal dialysis programmes. These models are very flexible since they may consider smooth estimates of baseline transition intensities and the inclusion of time-varying and smooth covariate effects at each transition. A key issue in survival analysis is the quantification of the time-dependent predictive accuracy of a given regression model, which is typically assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC)'based methodologies. The main objective of the present study is to adapt the concept of time-dependent ROC curve, and their corresponding area under the curve (AUC), to a multi-state competing risks framework. All statistical methodologies discussed in this work were applied to PD survival data. Using a multi-state competing risks framework, this study explored the effects of major clinical covariates on survival such as age, sex, diabetes and previous renal replacement therapy. Such multi-state model was composed of one transient state (peritonitis) and several absorbing states (death, transfer to haemodialysis and renal transplantation). The application of STAR models combined with time-dependent ROC curves revealed important conclusions not previously reported in the nephrology literature when using standard statistical methodologies. For practical application, all the statistical methods proposed in this article were implemented in R and we wrote and made available a script named as NestedCompRisks.","time-dependent ROC curve,competing risks,multi-state models,peritoneal dialysis,STAR model,survival analysis","OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVES,MAJOR CLINICAL COMPLICATION,PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL,SURVIVAL,REGRESSION,CANCER,PERFORMANCE,PATIENT,SPLINES","Teixeira, Laetitia@Univ Porto, Inst Biomed Sci Abel Salazar, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira, P-4050313 Oporto, Portugal@Univ Porto, ISPUP EPIUnit, Oporto, Portugal::Cadarso-Suarez, Carmen@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Sch Med, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Unit Biostat, Santiago De Compostela, Spain::Rodrigues, Anabela@Univ Porto, Inst Biomed Sci Abel Salazar, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira, P-4050313 Oporto, Portugal@CHP Hosp Geral de Santo Antonio, Dept Nephrol, Oporto, Portugal::Mendonca, Denisa@Univ Porto, Inst Biomed Sci Abel Salazar, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira, P-4050313 Oporto, Portugal@Univ Porto, ISPUP EPIUnit, Oporto, Portugal","Teixeira, Laetitia@Universidade do Porto::Cadarso-Suarez, Carmen@University of Santiago De Compostela::Rodrigues, Anabela@Universidade do Porto::Mendonca, Denisa@Universidade do Porto","Mendonca, Denisa@K-5561-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4835-8944::Teixeira, Laetitia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9276-3683::Soares Rodrigues, Anabela@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8818-2141","PREDICTORS OF LONG-TERM SURVIVAL ON PERITONEAL DIALYSIS IN SOUTH INDIA: A MULTICENTER STUDY+Abraham, Georgi; Kumar, Vishnu; Nayak, Karopadi Shivanand; et al.+PERITONEAL DIALYSIS INTERNATIONAL+JAN-FEB 2010::NEAREST-NEIGHBOR ESTIMATION OF A BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTION UNDER RANDOM CENSORING+AKRITAS, MG+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1994::Interpretability and importance of functionals in competing risks and multistate models+Andersen, Per Kragh; Keiding, Niels+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 20 2012::no title+Belitz, C.; Brezger, A.; Kneib, T.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lang, S.; Umlauf, N</span>.+BayesX: Software for Bayesian Inference in Structured Additive Regression Models+2012::no title+Beyersmann, J; Allignol, A; Schumacher, M.+Competing risks and multistate models with R+2012::Estimating and comparing time-dependent areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for censored event times with competing risks+Blanche, Paul; Dartigues, Jean-Francois; Jacqmin-Gadda, Helene+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2013::Generalized structured additive regression based on Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 24 2006::Flexible hazard ratio curves for continuous predictors in multi-state models: an application to breast cancer data+Cadarso-Suarez, Carmen; Meira-Machado, Luis; Kneib, Thomas; et al.+STATISTICAL MODELLING+OCT 2010::Assessment of performance of survival prediction models for cancer prognosis+Chen, Hung-Chia; Kodell, Ralph L.; Cheng, Kuang Fu; et al.+BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY+JUL 23 2012::PERITONITIS REMAINS THE MAJOR CLINICAL COMPLICATION OF PERITONEAL DIALYSIS: THE LONDON, UK, PERITONITIS AUDIT 2002-2003+Davenport, Andrew+PERITONEAL DIALYSIS INTERNATIONAL+MAY-JUN 2009::no title+Davison, A.

Bayesian semiparametric density ratio modelling with applications to medical malpractice reform,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16641793,AUG 2016,56,0,"This study examines the efficacy of tort reforms instituted throughout the country during the last decade, improving upon existing semiparametric density ratio estimation (DRE) methodologies in the process. DRE is a well-known semiparametric modelling technique that has been used for well over two decades. Although the approach has been demonstrated to be extremely useful in statistical modelling, it has suffered from one main limitationthe methodology has thus far not been capable of modelling individual-level heterogeneity. We address this issue by presenting a novel adaptation of DRE to model individual level heterogeneity. We do so by marginalizing the associated empirical likelihood function involving density ratios to provide an overall distribution of the entire population despite having extremely limited initial information about each individual in the dataset. We apply this approach to medical malpractice loss data from the previous decade to quantify the probability of changes in tort losses. Our results demonstrate the success of a number of recently implemented malpractice reforms. Comparisons to existing DRE methods, as well as standard regression methods, illustrate the efficacy of our approach.","Bayesian computation,Density ratio estimation,medical malpractice reform,semiparametric modelling,tort reform","GERM-CELL DATA,EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD,DEFENSIVE MEDICINE,REGRESSION,INFERENCE","Dayaratna, Kevin D.@Heritage Fdn, Ctr Data Anal, 214 Massachusetts Ave NE, Washington, DC 20002 USA::Kedem, Benjamin@Univ Maryland, Dept Math, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Dayaratna, Kevin D.@Unknow::Kedem, Benjamin@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park",not exist,"no title+no author+Judicial Hellholes 2014-2015+2014::Multi-task learning for HIV therapy screening+Bickel, S; Bogojeska, J; Lengauer, T.+Proc 25th Int Conf Mach Learn-ICML'08.+2008::Compelling evidence makes the case for a market-driven health care system+Capretta, J; Dayaratna, KD.+Heritage Foundation Backgrounder+2013::no title+no author+The Effects of Tort Reform: Evidence from the States+2004::Health care and medical malpractice reform: The necessity of reform in the current debate+Cornyn, J; Meese, E.+Heritage Foundation Lecture+2010::no title+Crain, N.

Partitioned conditional generalized linear models for categorical responses,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16644874,AUG 2016,3,2,"In categorical data analysis, several regression models have been proposed for hierarchically structured responses, such as the nested logit model, the two-step model or the partitioned conditional model for partially ordered set. The specifications of these models are heterogeneous and they have been formally defined for only two or three levels in the hierarchy. Here, we introduce the class of partitioned conditional generalized linear models (PCGLMs) that encompasses all these models and is defined for any number of levels in the hierarchy. The hierarchical structure of these models is fully specified by a partition tree of categories. Using the genericity of the recently introduced (r,F,Z) specification of generalized linear models (GLMs) for categorical responses, it is possible to use different link functions and explanatory variables for each partitioning step. PCGLMs thus constitute a very flexible framework for modelling hierarchically structured categorical responses including partially ordered responses.","Specification of GLMs,Hasse diagram,Hierarchical structure among categories,partially ordered variable,partition tree",,"Peyhardi, Jean@Univ Montpellier, Inst Montpellierain Alexander Grothendieck, F-34095 Montpellier, France::Trottier, Catherine@Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Inst Montpellierain Alexander Grothendieck, F-34199 Montpellier, France::Guedon, Yann@CIRAD, Ameliorat Genet & Adaptat Plantes, F-34095 Montpellier, France@Inria, Virtual Plants, F-34095 Montpellier, France","Peyhardi, Jean@Universite de Montpellier@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)::Trottier, Catherine@Universite de Montpellier@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)@Universite Paul-Valery::Guedon, Yann@CIRAD@Inria",not exist,"no title+Greene, W.

This mixture generalizes the CUB model to the multivariate case by taking into account the association among answers of the same individual to the items of a questionnaire.

Regularized regression for categorical data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16642560,JUN 2016,141,2,"In the last two decades, regularization techniques, in particular penalty-based methods, have become very popular in statistical modelling. Driven by technological developments, most approaches have been designed for high-dimensional problems with metric variables, whereas categorical data has largely been neglected. In recent years, however, it has become clear that regularization is also very promising when modelling categorical data. A specific trait of categorical data is that many parameters are typically needed to model the underlying structure. This results in complex estimation problems that call for structured penalties which are tailored to the categorical nature of the data. This article gives a systematic overview of penalty-based methods for categorical data developed so far and highlights some issues where further research is needed. We deal with categorical predictors as well as models for categorical response variables. The primary interest of this article is to give insight into basic properties of and differences between methods that are important with respect to statistical modelling in practice, without going into technical details or extensive discussion of asymptotic properties.","boosting,categorical data,fused lasso,group lasso,multinomial model,proportional odds model,regression trees","VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS,LINEAR-MIXED MODELS,IMPLICIT VARIABLE SELECTION,MULTINOMIAL LOGIT-MODELS,LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS,PAIRED-COMPARISON DATA,GROUP LASSO,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,EFFECT MODIFIERS,BOOSTING ALGORITHMS","Tutz, Gerhard@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, Munich, Germany::Gertheiss, Jan@Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Appl Stochast & Operat Res, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany","Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich::Gertheiss, Jan@TU Clausthal",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of ordinal categorical data+2010::Examples in which misspecification of a random effects distribution reduces efficiency, and possible remedies+Agresti, A; Caffo, B; Ohman-Strickland, P+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 2004::ANALYSIS OF ORDINAL PAIRED COMPARISON DATA+AGRESTI, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1992::MULTIVARIATE BINARY DISCRIMINATION BY KERNEL METHOD+AITCHISON, J; AITKEN, CGG+BIOMETRIKA+1976::A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::Consistency of the group Lasso and multiple kernel learning+Bach, Francis R.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+JUN 2008::A Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm for Linear Inverse Problems+Beck, Amir; Teboulle, Marc+SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES+2009::Simultaneous Factor Selection and Collapsing Levels in ANOVA+Bondell, Howard D.; Reich, Brian J.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2009::SCIENCE, STATISTICS, AND PAIRED COMPARISONS+BRADLEY, RA+BIOMETRICS+1976::no title+Breiman, L.; Friedman, J.

Discussion: Deterioration of performance of the lasso with many predictors,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16642643,JUN 2016,11,1,"Oracle inequalities provide probability loss bounds for the lasso estimator at a deterministic choice of the regularization parameter and are commonly cited as theoretical justification for the lasso and its ability to handle high-dimensional settings. Unfortunately, in practice, the regularization parameter is not selected to be a deterministic quantity, but is instead chosen using a random, data-dependent procedure, often making these inequalities misleading in their implications. We discuss general results and demonstrate empirically for data using categorical predictors that the amount of deterioration in performance of the lasso as the number of unnecessary predictors increases can be far worse than the oracle inequalities suggest, but imposing structure on the form of the estimates can reduce this deterioration substantially.","deterioration,Oracle inequalities",SELECTION,"Flynn, Cheryl J.@AT&T Labs Res, New York, NY USA::Hurvich, Clifford M.@NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, 44 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA::Simonoff, Jeffrey S.@NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, 44 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA","Flynn, Cheryl J.@AT&T::Hurvich, Clifford M.@New York University::Simonoff, Jeffrey S.@New York University",not exist,"Statistical significance in high-dimensional linear models+Buehlmann, Peter+BERNOULLI+SEP 2013::Statistics for High-Dimensional Data: Methods, Theory and Applications+Buehlmann, Peter; van de Geer, Sara+STATISTICS FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA: METHODS, THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+2011::NEAR-IDEAL MODEL SELECTION BY l(1) MINIMIZATION+Candes, Emmanuel J.; Plan, Yaniv+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2009::A new perspective on least squares under convex constraint+Chatterjee, S.+Preprint arXiv: 1402. 0830.+2014::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Efficiency for Regularization Parameter Selection in Penalized Likelihood Estimation Of Misspecified Models+Flynn, Cheryl J.; Hurvich, Clifford M.; Simonoff, Jeffrey S.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2013::On the sensitivity of the lasso to the number of predictor variables+Flynn, CJ; Hurvich, CM; Simonoff, JS.+Preprint arXiv: 1403. 4544.+2016::A Survey of L-1 Regression+Vidaurre, Diego; Bielza, Concha; Larranaga, Pedro+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2013::Tuning parameter selectors for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation method+Wang, Hansheng; Li, Runze; Tsai, Chih-Ling+BIOMETRIKA+AUG 2007::Regularization Parameter Selections via Generalized Information Criterion+Zhang, Yiyun; Li, Runze; Tsai, Chin-Ling+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2010::On the ""degrees of freedom"" of the lasso+Zou, Hui; Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Robert+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2007"

We focus on predictors though the issues raised also apply to responses.

The framework consists of estimating a time-varying coefficient function that is modelled as a linear combination of time-invariant functions with time-varying coefficients. The model uses extrinsic information to inform the structure of the penalty, while the estimation procedure exploits the equivalence between penalized least squares estimation and a linear mixed model representation. The process is empirically evaluated with several simulations and it is applied to analyze the neurocognitive impairment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients and its association with longitudinally-collected magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) curves.","functional data analysis,Longitudinal data,LongPEER estimate,structured penalty,generalized singular value decomposition","LINEAR-MODELS,REGRESSION,ESTIMATORS,BRAIN","Kundu, Madan G.@Novartis Pharmaceut Corp Oncol, E Hanover, NJ USA::Harezlak, Jaroslaw@Indiana Univ, RM Fairbanks Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA::Randolph, Timothy W.@Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Biostat & Biomath Program, Seattle, WA USA","Kundu, Madan G.@Novartis::Harezlak, Jaroslaw@Indiana University Bloomington@Indiana University System::Randolph, Timothy W.@Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center",not exist,"no title+Bjorck, A.+Numerical Methods for Least Squares Problems+1996::Prediction in functional linear regression+Cai, T.

Using a latent variable model with non-constant factor loadings to examine PM2.5 constituents related to secondary inorganic aerosols,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X15627004,APR 2016,46,0,"Factor analysis is a commonly used method of modelling correlated multivariate exposure data. Typically, the measurement model is assumed to have constant factor loadings. However, from our preliminary analyses of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) PM2.5 fine speciation data, we have observed that the factor loadings for four constituents change considerably in stratified analyses. Since invariance of factor loadings is a prerequisite for valid comparison of the underlying latent variables, we propose a factor model that includes non-constant factor loadings that change over time and space using P-spline penalized with the generalized cross-validation (GCV) criterion. The model is implemented using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and we select the multiple spline smoothing parameters by minimizing the GCV criterion with Newton's method during each iteration of the EM algorithm. The algorithm is applied to a one-factor model that includes four constituents.

"Generalized multiple indicators, multiple causes measurement error models",STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X16638478,APR 2016,23,1,"Generalized Multiple Indicators, Multiple Causes Measurement Error Models (G-MIMIC ME) can be used to study the effects of an unobservable latent variable on a set of outcomes when the causes of the latent variables are unobserved. The errors associated with the unobserved causal variables can be due to either bias recall or day-to-day variability. Another potential source of error, the Berkson error, is due to individual variations that arise from the assignment of group data to individual subjects. In this article, we accomplish the following: (a) extend the classical linear MIMIC models to allow both Berkson and classical measurement errors where the distributions of the outcome variables belong in the exponential family, (b) develop likelihood based estimation methods using the MC-EM algorithm and (c) estimate the variance of the classical measurement error associated with the approximation of the amount of radiation dose received by atomic bomb survivors at the time of their exposure. The G-MIMIC ME model is applied to study the effect of genetic damage, a latent construct based on exposure to radiation, and the effect of radiation dose on physical indicators of genetic damage.","atomic bomb survivor data,Berkson error,Generalized linear models,instrumental variables,measurement error,MIMIC models","ATOMIC-BOMB SURVIVORS,CHROMOSOME-ABERRATIONS,EM ALGORITHM","Tekwe, Carmen D.@Texas A&M Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, 226 SPH Adm Bldg, College Stn, TX USA::Carter, Randy L.@SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biostat, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA::Cullings, Harry M.@Radiat Effects Res Fdn, Dept Stat, Hiroshima, Japan","Tekwe, Carmen D.@Texas A&M Health Science Center@Texas A&M University System::Carter, Randy L.@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo::Cullings, Harry M.@Radiation Effects Research Foundation - Japan","Tekwe, Carmen@W-4737-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1857-2416","A Monte Carlo implementation of the EM algorithms and the poor man's data augmentation algorithms+[Anonymous].+Journal of the American Statistical Association+1990::Analysis of chromosome aberrations in atomic bomb survivors for dose assessment: Studies at the radiation effects research foundation from 1968 to 1993+Awa, A+STEM CELLS+1997::ON ERRORS-IN-VARIABLES FOR BINARY REGRESSION-MODELS+CARROLL, RJ; SPIEGELMAN, CH; LAN, KKG; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+1984::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::1977 RIETZ LECTURE - BOOTSTRAP METHODS - ANOTHER LOOK AT THE JACKKNIFE+EFRON, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::Biomarkers of genetic damage for cancer epidemiology+Fenech, M+TOXICOLOGY+DEC 27 2002::no title+Fuller, W.

Robust regression for highly corrupted response by shifting outliers,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X15624040,FEB 2016,30,0,"Outlying observations are often disregarded at the sacrifice of degrees of freedom or downsized via robust loss functions (e.g., Huber's loss) to reduce the undesirable impact on data analysis. In this article, we treat the outlying status of each observation as a parameter and propose a penalization method to automatically adjust the outliers. The proposed method shifts the outliers towards the fitted values, while preserve the non-outlying observations. We also develop a generally applicable algorithm in the iterative fashion to estimate model parameters and demonstrate the connection with the maximum likelihood based estimation procedure in the case of least squares estimation. We establish asymptotic property of the resulting parameter estimators under the condition that the proportion of outliers does not vanish as sample size increases. We apply the proposed outlier adjustment method to ordinary least squares and lasso-type penalization procedure and demonstrate its empirical value via numeric studies. Furthermore, we study applicability of the proposed method to two robust estimators, Huber's robust estimator and Huberized lasso, and demonstrate its noticeable improvement of model fit in the presence of extremely large outliers.","case-specific parameter,extreme outliers,Huber's estimator,robust lasso,robust linear model","VARIABLE SELECTION,LINEAR-REGRESSION,IDENTIFICATION,LIKELIHOOD,LASSO","Jung, Yoonsuh@Univ Waikato, Dept Stat, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand::Lee, Seung Pil@Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Int Sport & Leisure, Yongin, South Korea::Hu, Jianhua@Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Jung, Yoonsuh@University of Waikato::Lee, Seung Pil@Hankuk University Foreign Studies::Hu, Jianhua@UTMD Anderson Cancer Center@University of Texas System",not exist,"FINDING OUTLIERS THAT MATTER+ANDREWS, DF; PREGIBON, D+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1978::FITTING OF POWER-SERIES, MEANING POLYNOMIALS, ILLUSTRATED ON BAND-SPECTROSCOPIC DATA+BEATON, AE; TUKEY, JW+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::no title+Bloomfield, P.; Steiger, W.

Statistical modelling of gained university credits to evaluate the role of pre-enrolment assessment tests: An approach based on quantile regression for counts,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X15596087,FEB 2016,36,2,"Considering the case of the School of Economics of the University of Florence, the paper investigates whether the pre-enrolment assessment test is an effective tool to predict student performance. The analysis is tailored to evaluate the additional information yielded by the test beyond the background characteristics of the candidates already available from administrative records, such as the high school type and final grade. The student performance is measured by the number of gained credits after one year, which is a count variable with an irregular distribution and a peak in zero. These features pose a challenge in statistical modelling, which is solved by a two-part model with a logit specification for the zeros, while positive values are analyzed by quantile regression for counts. To disentangle direct and indirect effects of background variables, the result of the pre-enrolment assessment test is treated as an intermediate variable in a regression chain graph. The results show that the pre-enrolment test adds some information to predict student performance, which can be exploited for tutoring.","Hurdle model,quantile regression,regression chain graph,two-part model,zero-inflated counts","HEALTH-CARE,PERFORMANCE,FERTILITY,STUDENTS,SUCCESS","Grilli, Leonardo@Univ Florence, Dept Stat Comp Sci Applicat G Parenti, I-50121 Florence, Italy::Rampichini, Carla@Univ Florence, Dept Stat Comp Sci Applicat G Parenti, I-50121 Florence, Italy::Varriale, Roberta@Italian Natl Stat Inst ISTAT, Rome, Italy","Grilli, Leonardo@University of Florence::Rampichini, Carla@University of Florence::Varriale, Roberta@Unknow","Grilli, Leonardo@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3886-7705","A new indicator for higher education student performance+Adelfio, G.; Boscaino, G.; Capursi, V.+Higher Educ.+2014::A General Multivariate Latent Growth Model With Applications to Student Achievement+Bianconcini, Silvia; Cagnone, Silvia+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+APR 2012::Student outcomes at university in Australia: A quantile regression approach+Birch, E.R.; Miller, P.W.+Aust.

Functional linear mixed models for irregularly or sparsely sampled data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X15617594,FEB 2016,34,10,"We propose an estimation approach to analyse correlated functional data, which are observed on unequal grids or even sparsely. The model we use is a functional linear mixed model, a functional analogue of the linear mixed model. Estimation is based on dimension reduction via functional principal component analysis and on mixed model methodology. Our procedure allows the decomposition of the variability in the data as well as the estimation of mean effects of interest, and borrows strength across curves. Confidence bands for mean effects can be constructed conditionally on estimated principal components. We provide R-code implementing our approach in an online appendix. The method is motivated by and applied to data from speech production research.","functional additive mixed models,Dependent functional data,functional principal component analysis,penalized splines,speech production","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,SPLINES","Cederbaum, Jona@Univ Munich, Fac Math Comp Sci & Stat, Dept Stat, Ludwigstr 33, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Pouplier, Marianne@Univ Munich, Fac Languages & Literature, Dept Phonet & Speech Proc, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Hoole, Phil@Univ Munich, Fac Languages & Literature, Dept Phonet & Speech Proc, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Greven, Sonja@Univ Munich, Fac Math Comp Sci & Stat, Dept Stat, Ludwigstr 33, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Cederbaum, Jona@University of Munich::Pouplier, Marianne@University of Munich::Hoole, Phil@University of Munich::Greven, Sonja@University of Munich",not exist,"Linguistic pitch analysis using functional principal component mixed effect models+Aston, John A.

Emulating global climate change impacts on crop yields,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14568248,DEC 2015,39,4,"The potential effects of climate change on the environment and society are many. In order to effectively quantify the uncertainty associated with these effects, highly complex simulation models are run with detailed representations of ecosystem processes. These models are computationally expensive and can involve a computer run of several days. Computationally cheaper models can be obtained from large ensembles of simulations using statistical emulation. The purpose of this article is to construct a cheaper computational model (emulator) from simulations of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL), which is a dynamic global vegetation and crop model. This article focuses on statistical emulation of potential crop yields from LPJmL and an emulator is constructed using a combination of ordinary least squares, principal component analysis and weighted least squares methods. For five climate models, under cross-validation, the percentage of variance explained ranges from 60 to 88% for the rainfed crops and 62 to 93% for the irrigated crops. The emulator can be used to predict potential crop yield change under any future climate scenarios and management options.","crop yield,CO2 fertilization effect,principal components,distance weighted regression","MODEL CALIBRATION,FOOD-PRODUCTION,PRODUCTIVITY,SCENARIOS","Oyebamiji, Oluwole K.@Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England::Edwards, Neil R.@Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England::Holden, Philip B.@Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England::Garthwaite, Paul H.@Open Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England::Schaphoff, Sibyll@Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Res Domain Earth Syst Anal, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany::Gerten, Dieter@Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Res Domain Earth Syst Anal, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany","Oyebamiji, Oluwole K.@Open University - UK::Edwards, Neil R.@Open University - UK::Holden, Philip B.@Open University - UK::Garthwaite, Paul H.@Open University - UK::Schaphoff, Sibyll@Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung::Gerten, Dieter@Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung","Garthwaite, Paul@A-3664-2009","A global assessment of the effects of climate policy on the impacts of climate change+Arnell, N.

Subject-specific Bradley-Terry-Luce models with implicit variable selection,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X15571817,DEC 2015,30,3,"The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for paired comparison data is able to obtain a ranking of the objects that are compared pairwise by subjects. The task of each subject is to make preference decisions in favour of one of the objects. This decision is binary when subjects prefer either the first object or the second object, but can also be ordinal when subjects make their decisions on more than two preference categories. Since subject-specific covariates, which reflect characteristics of the subject, may affect the preference decision, it is essential to incorporate subject-specific covariates into the model. However, the inclusion of subject-specific covariates yields a model that contains many parameters and thus estimation becomes challenging. To overcome this problem, we propose a procedure that is able to select and estimate only relevant variables.","boosting,Bradley-Terry-Lucemodel,paired comparison,subject-specific covariate,variable selection","PAIRED-COMPARISON EXPERIMENTS,REGRESSION,RANKINGS,PACKAGE,TIES","Casalicchio, Giuseppe@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, Ludwigstr 33, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Tutz, Gerhard@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, Ludwigstr 33, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Schauberger, Gunther@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, Ludwigstr 33, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Casalicchio, Giuseppe@University of Munich::Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich::Schauberger, Gunther@University of Munich",not exist,"ANALYSIS OF ORDINAL PAIRED COMPARISON DATA+AGRESTI, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1992::Hierarchical modeling of paired comparison data+Bockenholt, U+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 2001::RANK ANALYSIS OF INCOMPLETE BLOCK DESIGNS .1.

Managing nonignorable missing data with clustered multinomial responses,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X15573606,DEC 2015,25,0,"Clustered multinomial responses are common in public health studies. In this situation, the baseline logit random effects model is usually suggested as a general modelling approach. When nonignorable missing outcomes exist, naive methods such as complete case analysis or likelihood methods ignoring missing information may distort the conclusions that are drawn. While methods to deal with binary and ordinal outcomes have been proposed, no easily implementable method is specifically available for missing clustered nominal responses. Joint modelling is usually one of the available choices but has high complexity in terms of likelihood. The numerical integration of both missing data and random effects is challenging. In this study, we have derived a closed form of likelihood. A simplified likelihood is also proposed, which is an extension of a previous study. One advantage is that both methods are easily implemented with commonly used software. We illustrate our proposed methods using the Global Youth Tobacco Survey and compare the results obtained by naive methods that ignore missing data with the results obtained using the proposed methods. Our approaches restore the parameter estimates and predicted probability of each category to an acceptable extent.

Model selection and clustering in stochastic block models based on the exact integrated complete data likelihood,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X15577017,DEC 2015,46,12,"The stochastic block model (SBM) is a mixture model for the clustering of nodes in networks. The SBM has now been employed for more than a decade to analyze very different types of networks in many scientific fields, including biology and the social sciences. Recently, an analytical expression based on the collapsing of the SBM parameters has been proposed, in combination with a sampling procedure that allows the clustering of the vertices and the estimation of the number of clusters to be performed simultaneously. Although the corresponding algorithm can technically accommodate up to 10 000 nodes and millions of edges, the Markov chain, however, tends to exhibit poor mixing properties, that is, low acceptance rates, for large networks. Therefore, the number of clusters tends to be highly overestimated, even for a very large number of samples. In this article, we rely on a similar expression, which we call the integrated complete data log likelihood, and propose a greedy inference algorithm that focuses on maximizing this exact quantity. This algorithm incurs a smaller computational cost than existing inference techniques for the SBM and can be employed to analyze large networks (several tens of thousands of nodes and millions of edges) with no convergence problems. Using toy datasets, the algorithm exhibits improvements over existing strategies, both in terms of clustering and model selection. An application to a network of blogs related to illustrations and comics is also provided.","greedy inference,integrated classification likelihood,networks,random graphs,stochastic block models","SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,MIXTURE,INFERENCE,GRAPHS","Come, Etienne@Univ Paris Est, IFSTTAR, GRETTIA, Noisy Le Grand, France::Latouche, Pierre@Univ Paris 01, Lab SAMM, 90 Rue Tolbiac, F-75634 Paris 13, France","Come, Etienne@IFSTTAR::Latouche, Pierre@Unknow",not exist,"The political blogosphere and the 2004 US election+Adamic, L; Glance, N.+P WWW WORKSH WEBL EC+2005::Mixed member- ship stochastic block models for relational data with application to protein- protein interactions+Airoldi, E.

Thinning-based models in the analysis of integer-valued time series: A review,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X15584701,DEC 2015,117,13,"This article aims at providing a comprehensive survey of recent developments in the field of integer-valued time series modelling, paying particular attention to models obtained as discrete counterparts of conventional autoregressive moving average and bilinear models, and based on the concept of thinning. Such models have proven to be useful in the analysis of many real-world applications ranging from economy and finance to medicine. We review the literature of the most relevant thinning operators proposed in the analysis of univariate and multivariate integer-valued time series with either finite or infinite support. Finally, we also outline and discuss possible directions of future research.","time series,autocorrelation function(ACF),counts,thinning operators","BINOMIAL AUTOREGRESSIVE PROCESSES,INAR(1) PROCESSES,COUNT DATA,LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,SELF-DECOMPOSABILITY,MARKOV-PROCESSES,AR(1) MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS,DEPENDENCE,MARGINS","Scotto, Manuel G.@Univ Aveiro, CIDMA, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal@Univ Aveiro, Dept Math, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal::Weiss, Christian H.@Univ Hamburg, Dept Math & Stat, Hamburg, Germany::Gouveia, Sonia@Univ Aveiro, Dept Math, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal@Univ Aveiro, CIDMA, IEETA, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal","Scotto, Manuel G.@Universidade de Aveiro::Weiss, Christian H.@University of Hamburg::Gouveia, Sonia@Universidade de Aveiro","Gouveia, Sonia@H-4512-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0375-7610::Scotto, Manuel@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8427-2684","Integer-valued moving average (INMA) process+Al-Osh, M.; Alzaid, A.

Validating predictors of therapeutic success: A causal inference approach,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X15586286,DEC 2015,12,0,"In personalized medicine medical decisions, practices and/or products are tailored to the individual patient. The idea is to provide the right patient with the right drug at the right dose at the right time. However, our current lack of ability to predict an individual patient's treatment success for most diseases and conditions is a major challenge to achieve the goal of personalized medicine. In the present work, we argue that many of the techniques often used to evaluate predictors of therapeutic success may not be able to answer the relevant scientific questions and we propose a new validation strategy based on causal inference. The methodology is illustrated using data from a clinical trial in opiate/heroin addiction.

Selection and fusion of categorical predictors with L-0-Type penalties,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14553366,OCT 2015,32,1,"In regression modelling, categorical covariates have to be coded. Depending on the number of categorical covariates and on the number of levels they have, the number of coefficients can become huge. To reduce the model complexity, coefficients of similar categories should be fused and coefficients of non-influential categories should be set to zero. To this end, Lasso-type penalties on the differences of coefficients are a standard approach. However, the clustering/selection performance of this approach is sometimes poor-especially when the adaptive weights are badly conditioned or not existing. In some situations, there is no incentive to cluster similar categories. To overcome this, a L-0 penalty on the differences of coefficients is proposed, whereby the L-0 'norm' is defined as the number of non-zero entries in a vector. The proposed penalty favours to find clusters of categories that share the same effect on the response variable while the estimation accuracy is comparable to Lasso-type penalties. Numerical experiments within the framework of generalized linear models are promising. For illustration, data on the unemployment rates in Germany is analyzed.","adaptive Lasso,best subset selection,GLMs,model selection","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,SPARSE REPRESENTATION,ORACLE PROPERTIES,LASSO,REGULARIZATION,LIKELIHOOD","Oelker, Margret-Ruth@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Poessnecker, Wolfgang@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Tutz, Gerhard@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Oelker, Margret-Ruth@University of Munich::Poessnecker, Wolfgang@University of Munich::Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich",not exist,"Regularization of wavelet approximations+Antoniadis, A; Fan, JQ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::Simultaneous Factor Selection and Collapsing Levels in ANOVA+Bondell, Howard D.; Reich, Brian J.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2009::MODEL SELECTION AND AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) - THE GENERAL-THEORY AND ITS ANALYTICAL EXTENSIONS+BOZDOGAN, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::Optimally sparse representation in general (nonorthogonal) dictionaries via l(1) minimization+Donoho, DL; Elad, M+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+MAR 4 2003::no title+Fahrmeir, L.; Tutz, G.+Multivariate statistical modelling based on generalized linear models+2001::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::A note on the complexity of lp minimization+Ge, D; Jiang, X; Ye, Y.+Math.

Analyzing bivariate ordinal data with CUB margins,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14558770,OCT 2015,51,4,"Statistical modelling for ordinal data has received a considerable attention in the literature, and a consolidated theory relying on Generalized Linear Model approach has been developed. In this article, we present an innovative technique for modelling bivariate ordinal data. In particular, we consider the method introduced by Plackett for constructing a one-parameter bivariate distribution from given margins, and we apply it in order to represent correlated ordinal variables which individually follows a CUB model. This is a univariate mixture distribution defined by the convex Combination of a Uniform and a shifted Binomial distribution whose parameters may be related to rater's covariates. The article shows how the bivariate distribution can be defined and how its characterizing parameter, which describes the association between the component random variables, can be related to the subject's covariates. The proposed approach is applied to the study of two key drivers of extra virgin olive oil consumption in Italy. The technique allows a representation of the data whose meaning can be easily interpreted providing useful information for management support.","Ordinal data,Plackett distribution,CUB models,food quality","MULTIVARIATE CATEGORICAL RESPONSES,VIRGIN OLIVE OILS,CONSUMERS,MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS,PREFERENCES","Corduas, Marcella@Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, I-80138 Naples, Italy","Corduas, Marcella@University of Naples Federico II",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of ordinal categorical data+2010::On a copula model with CUB margins, QdS+Andreis, F; Ferrari, PA.+Journal of Methodological and Applied Statistics+2013::Detecting semiotically expressed humor in diasporic tv productions+Balirano, G.; Corduas, M.+Int.

Expectile and quantile regression-David and Goliath?,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14561155,OCT 2015,45,14,"Recent interest in modern regression modelling has focused on extending available ( mean) regression models by describing more general properties of the response distribution. An alternative approach is quantile regression where regression effects on the conditional quantile function of the response are assumed. While quantile regression can be seen as a generalization of median regression, expectiles as alternative are a generalized form of mean regression.

Generally, quantiles provide a natural interpretation even beyond the 0.5 quantile, the median. A comparable simple interpretation is not available for expectiles beyond the 0.5 expectile, the mean. Nonetheless, expectiles have some interesting properties, some of which are discussed in this article. We contrast the two approaches and show how to get quantiles from a fine grid of expectiles. We compare such quantiles from expectiles with direct quantile estimates regarding efficiency. We also look at regression problems where both quantile and expectile curves have the undesirable property that neighbouring curves may cross each other. We propose a modified method to estimate non-crossing expectile curves based on splines. In an application, we look at the expected shortfall, a risk measure used in finance, which requires both expectiles and quantiles for estimation and which can be calculated easily with the proposed methods in the article.","Expected shortfall,least asymmetrically weighted squares,non-crossing,penalized splines,semiparametric","VARYING COEFFICIENT MODELS,SMOOTHING SPLINES,P-SPLINES,CURVES,MONOTONICITY,SHORTFALL,RISK,CARE","Waltrup, Linda Schulze@Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Sobotka, Fabian@Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany::Kneib, Thomas@Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany::Kauermann, Goeran@Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Waltrup, Linda Schulze@University of Munich::Sobotka, Fabian@University of Gottingen::Kneib, Thomas@University of Gottingen::Kauermann, Goeran@University of Munich",not exist,"P-splines quantile regression estimation in varying coefficient models+Andriyana, Y.; Gijbels, I.; Verhasselt, A.+TEST+MAR 2014::Quantile regression with monotonicity restrictions using P-splines and the L-1-norm+Bollaerts, Kaatje; Eilers, Paul H.

Modelling volatility using a non-homogeneous martingale model for processes with constant mean on count data,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14565358,OCT 2015,21,0,"In this article a non-homogeneous martingale model is proposed to model volatility in a stochastic time series of count data with constant mean. The approach is derived from a general non-homogeneous birth-and-death process, in which the mean and the variance of population size can vary as a function of time. This model can be important in modelling early warning signals that there is going to be a change of state in a complex system. The net reproduction ratio obtained from fitting a non-homogeneous birth-death model can be used as an additional tool to compare this model with a model where there is no change in the mean over the observation period. These models and procedures are illustrated with quarterly Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus prevalence data registered since 2001 from three Acute Trusts of hospitals of the National Health Service in Great Britain.","count data,martingale,net reproduction ratio,non-homogeneous birth-death process,variance,volatility","RESISTANT-STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS,INFECTION,RISK","van den Broek, Jan@Univ Utrecht, Fac Vet Med, NL-3584 CL Utrecht, Netherlands","van den Broek, Jan@Utrecht University",not exist,"Climate volatility deepens poverty vulnerability in developing countries+Ahmed, SA; Diffenbaugh, NS; Hertel, TW.+Environmental Research Letters+2009::no title+Bailey, N.

(1998) introduced a rich family of models for discrete longitudinal data called acyclic probabilistic finite automata. These may be represented as directed graphs that embody context-specific conditional independence relations. Here, the approach is developed from a statistical perspective. It is shown here that likelihood ratio tests may be constructed using standard contingency table methods, a model selection procedure that minimizes a penalized likelihood criterion is described, and a way to extend the models to incorporate covariates is proposed. The methods are applied to a small-scale dataset. Finally, it is shown that the models generalize certain subclasses of conventional undirected and directed graphical models.","acyclic probabilistic finite automata,graphical model context-specific,state merging,conditional independence,Markov,chain event graph","CHAIN EVENT GRAPHS,FINITE-STATE MACHINES,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,INFERENCE,AUTOMATA","Edwards, David@Aarhus Univ, Ctr Quantitat Genet & Genom, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark::Ankinakatte, Smitha@Mangalore Univ, Dept Stat, Mangalore, India","Edwards, David@Aarhus University::Ankinakatte, Smitha@Mangalore University",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::no title+Ankinakatte, S; Edwards, D.+Modelling discrete longitudinal data using acyclic probabilistic finite automata+no time::Refining a Bayesian Network using a Chain Event Graph+Barclay, L.

Bayesian bivariate quantile regression,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14551247,AUG 2015,18,1,"Quantile regression (QR) has become a widely used tool to study the impact of covariates on quantiles of a response distribution. QR provides a detailed description of the conditional response when considering a dense set of quantiles, without assuming a closed form for its distribution. The Bayesian version of QR, which can be implemented by considering the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD) as an auxiliary error distribution, is an attractive alternative to other methods because it returns knowledge on the whole parameter distribution instead of solely point estimations. While for the univariate case there has been a lot of development in the last few years, multivariate responses have only been treated to a little extent in the literature, especially in the Bayesian case. By using a multivariate version of the location scale mixture representation for the ALD, we are able to apply inference techniques developed for multivariate Gaussian models on multivariate quantile regression and make thus the impact of covariates on the quantiles of more than one dependent variable feasible. The model structure also facilitates the determination of conditional correlations between bivariate responses on different quantile levels after adjusting for covariate effects.","Bayesian quantile regression,structured additive Regression,seemingly unrelated regression,Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations",SPLINES,"Waldmann, Elisabeth@Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England::Kneib, Thomas@Univ Gottingen, Chair Stat & Econometry, Gottingen, Germany","Waldmann, Elisabeth@University of Liverpool::Kneib, Thomas@University of Gottingen",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+R:A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2011::no title+Belitz, C; Brezger, A; Kneib, T<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lang, S; Umlauf, N</span>.+BayesX: Software for Bayesian inference in structured additive regression models+2013::Generalized structured additive regression based on Bayesian P-splines+Brezger, A; Lang, S+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 24 2006::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Estimating extreme bivariate quantile regions+Einmahl, John H.

Eliciting prior distributions for extra parameters in some generalized linear models,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14553374,AUG 2015,23,1,"To elicit an informative prior distribution for a normal linear model or a gamma generalized linear model (GLM), expert opinion must be quantified about both the regression coefficients and the extra parameters of these models. The latter task has attracted comparatively little attention. In this article, we introduce two elicitation methods that aim to complete the prior structure of the normal and gamma GLMs. First, we develop a method of assessing a conjugate prior distribution for the error variance in normal linear models. The method quantifies an expert's opinions through assessments of a median and conditional medians. Second, we propose a novel method for eliciting a lognormal prior distribution for the scale parameter of gamma GLMs. Given the mean value of a gamma distributed response variable, the method is based on conditional quartile assessments. It can also be used to quantify an expert's opinion about the prior distribution for the shape parameter of any gamma random variable, if the mean of the distribution has been elicited or is assumed to be known. In the context of GLMs, the mean value is determined by the regression coefficients. Interactive graphics is the medium through which assessments for the two proposed methods are elicited. Examples illustrating use of the methods are given. Computer programs that implement both methods are available.","Elicitation,subjective prior distribution,normal linear model,gamma distribution,generalized linear model,interactive graphical software","PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,ELICITATION,REGRESSION,OPINION","Elfadaly, Fadlalla G.@Open Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt::Garthwaite, Paul H.@Open Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England","Elfadaly, Fadlalla G.@Cairo University@Open University - UK::Garthwaite, Paul H.@Open University - UK","Garthwaite, Paul@A-3664-2009","An elicitation method for multivariate normal distributions+Al-Awadhi, SA; Garthwaite, PH+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1998::no title+Al-Awadhi, SA.+Elicitation of prior distribution for a multivariate normal distribution+1997::Prior distribution assessment for a multivariate normal distribution: an experimental study+Al-Awadhi, SA; Garthwaite, PH+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JAN 2001::A progress report on the training of probability assessors+Alpert, M.; Raiffa, H.+Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases+1969::A fundamental, eco-hydrological basis for niche segregation in plant communities+Araya, Yoseph N.; Silvertown, Jonathan; Gowing, David J.; et al.+NEW PHYTOLOGIST+2011::A new perspective on priors for generalized linear models+Bedrick, EJ; Christensen, R; Johnson, W+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::Conjugate priors for generalized linear models+Chen, MH; Ibrahim, JG+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2003::Use of expert knowledge in evaluating costs and benefits of alternative service provisions: A case study+Garthwaite, Paul H.; Chilcott, James B.; Jenkinson, David J.; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE+SUM 2008::Prior distribution elicitation for generalized linear and piecewise-linear models+Garthwaite, Paul H.; Al-Awadhi, Shafeeqah A.; Elfadaly, Fadlalla G.; et al.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JAN 1 2013::ELICITATION OF PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR VARIABLE-SELECTION PROBLEMS IN REGRESSION+GARTHWAITE, PH; DICKEY, JM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1992::Statistical methods for eliciting probability distributions+Garthwaite, PH; Kadane, JB; O'Hagan, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2005::QUANTIFYING EXPERT OPINION IN LINEAR-REGRESSION PROBLEMS+GARTHWAITE, PH; DICKEY, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1988::COGNITIVE-PROCESSES AND ASSESSMENT OF SUBJECTIVE-PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS+HOGARTH, RM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1975::ON BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS USING JEFFREYS PRIOR+IBRAHIM, JG; LAUD, PW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1991::INTERACTIVE ELICITATION OF OPINION FOR A NORMAL LINEAR-MODEL+KADANE, JB; DICKEY, JM; WINKLER, RL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1980::Experiences in elicitation+Kadane, JB; Wolfson, LJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+1998::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF THE 2-PARAMETER GAMMA-DISTRIBUTION+MILLER, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+1980::no title+O'Hagan, A; Buck, CE; Daneshkhah, A.+Uncertain Judgements: Eliciting Experts' Probabilities+2006::no title+Pratt, J.W.; Raiffa, H.; Schlaifer, R.+Introduction to Statistical Decision Theory+1995::SCALE-PARAMETERS - A BAYESIAN TREATMENT+SWEETING, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1981::Generalized linear models: scale parameters, outlier accommodation and prior distributions+West, M.+Bayesian Statistics+1985::DYNAMIC GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS AND BAYESIAN FORECASTING+WEST, M; HARRISON, PJ; MIGON, HS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::Representation of water table dynamics in a land surface scheme.

Longitudinal mixed-effects models for latent cognitive function,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14555607,AUG 2015,38,2,"A mixed-effects regression model with a bent-cable change-point predictor is formulated to describe potential decline of cognitive function over time in the older population. For the individual trajectories, cognitive function is considered to be a latent variable measured through an item response theory model given longitudinal test data. Individual-specific parameters are defined for both cognitive function and the rate of change over time, using the change-point predictor for non-linear trends. Bayesian inference is used, where the Deviance Information Criterion and the L-criterion are investigated for model comparison. Special attention is given to the identifiability of the item response parameters. Item response theory makes it possible to use dichotomous and polytomous test items, and to take into account missing data and survey-design change during follow-up. This will be illustrated in an application where data stem from the Cambridge City over-75s Cohort Study.","bent-cable,change point,cognition,growth-curve model,item response theory (IRT),longitudinal data analysis","ITEM RESPONSE MODELS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,REGRESSION,INFERENCE,POINTS,CHOICE","van den Hout, Ardo@UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England::Fox, Jean-Paul@Univ Twente, Fac Behav Sci, OMD, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands::Muniz-Terrera, Graciela@MRC, Unit Lifelong Hlth & Ageing, London, England","van den Hout, Ardo@University College London@University of London::Fox, Jean-Paul@University of Twente::Muniz-Terrera, Graciela@Unknow","Fox, Jean-Paul@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0058-1496","Latent Markov model for longitudinal binary data: An application to the performance evaluation of nursing homes+Bartolucci, F; Lupparelli, M; Montanari, GE.+Annals of Applied Statistics+2009::Approaches for statistical inference+Carlin, Bradley P.; Louis, Thomas A.+BAYESIAN METHODS FOR DATA ANALYSIS, THIRD EDITION+2009::Bent-cable regression theory and applications+Chiu, G; Lockhart, R; Routledge, R+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2006::no title+Cohen, P.+Applied Data Analytic Techniques for Turning Points Research+2008::Item response models for longitudinal quality of life data in clinical trials+Douglas, JA+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 15 1999::MINI-MENTAL STATE - PRACTICAL METHOD FOR GRADING COGNITIVE STATE OF PATIENTS FOR CLINICIAN+FOLSTEIN, MF; FOLSTEIN, SE; MCHUGH, PR+JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH+1975::Bayesian Item Response Modeling: Theory and Applications+Fox, JP+BAYESIAN ITEM RESPONSE MODELING: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+2010::Bayesian estimation of a multilevel IRT model using Gibbs sampling+Fox, JP; Glas, CAW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2001::PREDICTIVE APPROACH TO MODEL SELECTION+GEISSER, S; EDDY, WF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::Model choice: A minimum posterior predictive loss approach+Gelfand, AE; Ghosh, SK+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1998::ILLUSTRATION OF BAYESIAN-INFERENCE IN NORMAL DATA MODELS USING GIBBS SAMPLING+GELFAND, AE; HILLS, SE; RACINEPOON, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1990::BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE - ASYMPTOTICS AND EXACT CALCULATIONS+GELFAND, AE; DEY, DK+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1994::no title+Gelman, A.; Carlin, J.

Dirichlet Lasso: A Bayesian approach to variable selection,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14551245,JUN 2015,21,2,"Selection of the most important predictor variables in regression analysis is one of the key problems statistical research has been concerned with for long time. In this article, we propose the methodology, Dirichlet Lasso (abbreviated as DLASSO) to address this issue in a Bayesian framework. In many modern regression settings, large set of predictor variables are grouped and the coefficients belonging to any one of these groups are either all redundant or all important in predicting the response; we say in those cases that the predictors exhibit a group structure. We show that DLASSO is particularly useful where the group structure is not fully known. We exploit the clustering property of Dirichlet Process priors to infer the possibly missing group information. The Dirichlet Process has the advantage of simultaneously clustering the variable coefficients and selecting the best set of predictor variables. We compare the predictive performance of DLASSO to Group Lasso and ordinary Lasso with real data and simulation studies. Our results demonstrate that the predictive performance of DLASSO is almost as good as that of Group Lasso when group label information is given; and superior to the ordinary Lasso for missing group information. For high dimensional data (e.g., genetic data) with missing group information, DLASSO will be a powerful approach of variable selection since it provides a superior predictive performance and higher statistical accuracy.","Bayesian Lasso,Dirichlet process prior,Group lasso,Gibbs sampling,M-H algorithm","ORACLE PROPERTIES,REGRESSION,SHRINKAGE,PRIORS","Das, Kiranmoy@Indian Stat Inst, Bayesian & Interdisciplinary Res Unit, Kolkata 700108, India::Sobel, Marc@Temple Univ, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Das, Kiranmoy@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute::Sobel, Marc@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Temple University",not exist,"General methods for monitoring convergence of iterative simulations+Brooks, SP; Gelman, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 1998::The local Dirichlet process+Chung, Yeonseung; Dunson, David B.+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+FEB 2011::A Bayesian Framework for Functional Mapping through Joint Modeling of Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data.+Das, Kiranmoy; Li, Runze; Huang, Zhongwen; et al.+International journal of plant genomics+2012::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Bayesian multiple comparisons using Dirichlet process priors+Gopalan, R; Berry, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1998::no title+no author+Bayesian Nonparametrics: Principles and Practice+2010::ProteinLasso: A Lasso regression approach to protein inference problem in shotgun proteomics+Huang, Ting; Gong, Haipeng; Yang, Can; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY+APR 2013::Approximate Dirichlet process computing in finite normal mixtures: Smoothing and prior information+Ishwaran, H; James, LF+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2002::Gibbs sampling methods for stick-breaking priors+Ishwaran, H; James, LF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Penalized Regression, Standard Errors, and Bayesian Lassos+Kyung, Minjung; Gill, Jeff; Ghosh, Malay; et al.+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2010::The Bayesian lasso for genome-wide association studies+Li, Jiahan; Das, Kiranmoy; Fu, Guifang; et al.+BIOINFORMATICS+FEB 15 2011::Bayesian Semiparametric Multiple Shrinkage+MacLehose, Richard F.; Dunson, David B.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2010::Bayesian methods for highly correlated exposure data+MacLehose, Richard F.; Dunson, David B.; Herring, Amy H.; et al.+EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAR 2007::Retrospective Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Dirichlet process hierarchical models+Papaspiliopoulos, Omiros; Roberts, Gareth O.+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2008::The Bayesian Lasso+Park, Trevor; Casella, George+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2008::Hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric models with applications+Teh, Y.

Two Cholesky-log-GARCH models for multivariate volatilities,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14551246,JUN 2015,31,2,"Parsimonious estimation of high-dimensional covariance matrices is of fundamental importance in multivariate statistics. Typical examples occur in finance, where the instantaneous dependence among several asset returns should be taken into account. Multivariate GARCH processes have been established as a standard approach for modelling such data. However, the majority of GARCH-type models are either based on strong assumptions that may not be realistic or require restrictions that are often too hard to be satisfied in practice. We consider two alternative decompositions of time-varying covariance matrices Sigma(t). The first is based on the modified Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrices and second relies on the hyperspherical parametrization of the standard Cholesky factor of their correlation matrices R-t. Then, we combine each Cholesky factor with the log-GARCH models for the corresponding time-varying volatilities and use a quasi maximum likelihood approach to estimate the parameters. Using log-GARCH models is quite natural for achieving the positive definiteness of Sigma t and this is a novelty of this work. Application of the proposed methodologies to two real financial datasets reveals their usefulness in terms of parsimony, ease of implementation and stresses the choice of the appropriate models using familiar data-driven processes such as various forms of the exploratory data analysis and regression.","Cholesky decomposition,Covariance matrix,GARCH model,hyperspherical coordinates,volatility","AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY,LONGITUDINAL DATA,REGRESSION-ANALYSIS,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,GENERALIZED ARCH,HETEROSCEDASTICITY,LASSO","Pedeli, Xanthi@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens, Greece::Fokianos, Konstantinos@Univ Cyprus, Dept Math & Stat, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus::Pourahmadi, Mohsen@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Pedeli, Xanthi@Athens University of Economics & Business::Fokianos, Konstantinos@University of Cyprus::Pourahmadi, Mohsen@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System",not exist,"no title+Alexander, C.+Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis+2001::GENERALIZED AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY+BOLLERSLEV, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1986::A CAPITAL-ASSET PRICING MODEL WITH TIME-VARYING COVARIANCES+BOLLERSLEV, T; ENGLE, RF; WOOLDRIDGE, JM+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+FEB 1988::MODELING THE COHERENCE IN SHORT-RUN NOMINAL EXCHANGE-RATES - A MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZED ARCH MODEL+BOLLERSLEV, T+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1990::Estimation of covariance matrix via the sparse Cholesky factor with lasso+Chang, Changgee; Tsay, Ruey S.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 2010::A Dynamic Multivariate Heavy-Tailed Model for Time-Varying Volatilities and Correlations+Creal, Drew; Koopman, Siem Jan; Lucas, Andre+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 2011::Large time-varying covariance matrices with applications to finance+Dellaportas, P; Pourahmadi, M.+Technical Report+2004::Cholesky-GARCH models with applications to finance+Dellaportas, Petros; Pourahmadi, Mohsen+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUL 2012::Dynamic conditional correlation: A simple class of multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models+Engle, R+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2002::MULTIVARIATE SIMULTANEOUS GENERALIZED ARCH+ENGLE, RF; KRONER, KF+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+MAR 1995::AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSCEDASTICITY WITH ESTIMATES OF THE VARIANCE OF UNITED-KINGDOM INFLATION+ENGLE, RF+ECONOMETRICA+1982::ASSET PRICING WITH A FACTOR-ARCH COVARIANCE STRUCTURE - EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES FOR TREASURY BILLS+ENGLE, RF; NG, VK; ROTHSCHILD, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL-AUG 1990::no title+Francq, C.; Zakoian, J.-M.+GARCH Models: Structure, Statistical Inference and Financial Applications .+2010::GARCH models without positivity constraints: Exponential or log GARCH?+Francq, Christian; Wintenberger, Olivier; Zakoiean, Jean-Michel+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2013::Modelling persistence of conditional variances: a comment+Geweke, J.+Econometric Reviews+1986::Semiparametric Mean-Covariance Regression Analysis for Longitudinal Data+Leng, Chenlei; Zhang, Weiping; Pan, Jianxin+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2010::Semiparametric and nonparametric regression analysis of longitudinal data+Lin, DY; Ying, Z+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Cholesky stochastic volatility models for highdimensional time series.+Lopes, HF; McCulloch, RE; Tsay, R.+Technical Report+2012::Nonparametric regression of covariance structures in longitudinal studies+Pan, J; Ye, H; Li, R.+MIMS Preprint+2009::On modelling mean-covariance structures in longitudinal studies+Pan, JX; Mackenzie, G+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2003::Maximum likelihood estimation of generalised linear models for multivariate normal covariance matrix+Pourahmadi, M+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2000::Joint mean-covariance models with applications to longitudinal data: Unconstrained parameterisation+Pourahmadi, M+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1999::Covariance Estimation: The GLM and Regularization Perspectives+Pourahmadi, Mohsen+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2011::Parameterizing correlations: a geometric interpretation+Rapisarda, F.; Brigo, D.; Mercurio, F.+IMA Journal of Management Mathematics+Jan. 2007::The Most General Methodology to Create a Valid Correlation Matrix for Risk Management and Option Pricing Purposes+Rebonato, R.; Jackel, P.+Journal of Risk+2000::Multivariate GARCH models+Silvennoinen, Annastiina; Terasvirta, Timo.+HDB FINANCIAL TIME S+2009::Regression shrinkage and selection via the Lasso+Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::no title+Tsay, R.

The model may be extended to allow for multiple functional predictors, time varying coefficients, and missing or unequally spaced data.

The functional linear array model,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14566913,JUN 2015,59,14,"The functional linear array model (FLAM) is a unified model class for functional regression models including function-on-scalar, scalar-on-function and function-on-function regression. Mean, median, quantile as well as generalized additive regression models for functional or scalar responses are contained as special cases in this general framework. Our implementation features a broad variety of covariate effects, such as, linear, smooth and interaction effects of grouping variables, scalar and functional covariates. Computational efficiency is achieved by representing the model as a generalized linear array model. While the array structure requires a common grid for functional responses, missing values are allowed. Estimation is conducted using a boosting algorithm, which allows for numerous covariates and automatic, data-driven model selection. To illustrate the flexibility of the model class we use three applications on curing of resin for car production, heat values of fossil fuels and Canadian climate data (the last one in the electronic supplement). These require function-on-scalar, scalar-on-function and function-on-function regression models, respectively, as well as additional capabilities such as robust regression, spatial functional regression, model selection and accommodation of missings. An implementation of our methods is provided in the R add-on package FDboost.","boosting,functional data analysis,smoothing,structured additive regression,varying coefficient models","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,ADDITIVE-MODELS,STABILITY SELECTION,QUANTILE REGRESSION,MIXED MODELS,P-SPLINES,PREDICTION","Brockhaus, Sarah@Univ Munich, Inst Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Scheipl, Fabian@Univ Munich, Inst Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Hothorn, Torsten@Univ Zurich, Abt Biostat, Inst Epidemiol Biostat & Pravent, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland::Greven, Sonja@Univ Munich, Inst Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Brockhaus, Sarah@University of Munich::Scheipl, Fabian@University of Munich::Hothorn, Torsten@University of Zurich::Greven, Sonja@University of Munich",not exist,"FDboost: boosting functional regression models+Brockhaus, S.+R package version 0. 0-7+2014::Boosting algorithms: Regularization, prediction and model fitting+Buehlmann, Peter; Hothorn, Torsten+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2007::Boosting with the L-2 loss: Regression and classification+Buhlmann, P; Yu, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2003::Quantile regression when the covariates are functions+Cardot, H; Crambes, C; Sarda, P+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+OCT 2005::Modeling Repeated Functional Observations+Chen, Kehui; Mueller, Hans-Georg+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2012::Conditional quantile analysis when covariates are functions, with application to growth data+Chen, Kehui; Mueller, Hans-Georg+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2012::no title+Crainiceanu, C.; Reiss, P.; Goldsmith, J.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Huang, L.; Huo, L.; Scheipl, F</span>.+refund: Regression with Functional Data+2014::Generalized linear array models with applications to multidimensional smoothing+Currie, ID; Durban, M; Eilers, PHC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::MULTILEVEL FUNCTIONAL PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS+Di, Chong-Zhi; Crainiceanu, Ciprian M.; Caffo, Brian S.; et al.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2009::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Identifying Risk Factors for Severe Childhood Malnutrition by Boosting Additive Quantile Regression+Fenske, Nora; Kneib, Thomas; Hothorn, Torsten+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2011::Regression when both response and predictor are functions+Ferraty, F.; Van Keilegom, I.; Vieu, P.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2012::no title+Ferraty, F.; Vieu, P.+Nonparametric Functional Data Analysis+2006::Conditional Quantiles for Dependent Functional Data with Application to the Climatic EL Nino Phenomenon+Ferraty, F.; Rabhi, A.; Vieu, P.+Sankhya: Special Issue on Quantile Regression and Related Methods+2005::Nonparametric regression on functional data: Inference and practical aspects+Ferraty, Frederic; Mas, Andre; Vieu, Philippe+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2007::Additive prediction and boosting for functional data+Ferraty, Frederic; Vieu, Philippe+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 15 2009::Greedy function approximation: A gradient boosting machine+Friedman, JH+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2001::Penalized scalar-on-functions regression with interaction term+Fuchs, Karen; Scheipl, Fabian; Greven, Sonja+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 2015::Variable selection in generalized functional linear models+Gertheiss, Jan; Maity, Arnab; Staicu, Ana-Maria+STAT+2013::Penalized Functional Regression+Goldsmith, Jeff; Bobb, Jennifer; Crainiceanu, Ciprian M.; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2011::Longitudinal functional principal component analysis+Greven, Sonja; Crainiceanu, Ciprian; Caffo, Brian; et al.+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2010::Penalized solutions to functional regression problems+Harezlak, Jaroslaw; Coull, Brent A.; Laird, Nan M.; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 15 2007::A Framework for Unbiased Model Selection Based on Boosting+Hofner, Benjamin; Hothorn, Torsten; Kneib, Thomas; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2011::Conditional transformation models+Hothorn, T; Kneib, T; Buhlmann, P.+Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology)+2013::no title+Hothorn, T.; Buhlmann, P.; Kneib, T.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Schmid, M.; Hofner, B</span>.+mboost: Model-Based Boosting.

Bayesian-multiplicative treatment of count zeros in compositional data sets,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14535524,APR 2015,10,18,"Compositional count data are discrete vectors representing the numbers of outcomes falling into any of several mutually exclusive categories. Compositional techniques based on the log-ratio methodology are appropriate in those cases where the total sum of the vector elements is not of interest. Such compositional count data sets can contain zero values which are often the result of insufficiently large samples. That is, they refer to unobserved positive values that may have been observed with a larger number of trials or with a different sampling design. Because the log-ratio transformations require data with positive values, any statistical analysis of count compositions must be preceded by a proper replacement of the zeros. A Bayesian-multiplicative treatment has been proposed for addressing this count zero problem in several case studies. This treatment involves the Dirichlet prior distribution as the conjugate distribution of the multinomial distribution and a multiplicative modification of the non-zero values. Different parameterizations of the prior distribution provide different zero replacement results, whose coherence with the vector space structure of the simplex is stated. Their performance is evaluated from both the theoretical and the computational point of view.","Dirichlet distribution,discrete composition,log-ratio transformations,posterior estimate,zero replacement",,"Martin-Fernandez, Josep-Antoni@Univ Girona, Dept Comp Sci Appl Math & Stat, E-17071 Girona, Spain::Hron, Karel@Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, Olomouc, Czech Republic@Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geoinformat, Olomouc, Czech Republic::Templ, Matthias@Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geoinformat, Olomouc, Czech Republic@Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Stat & Probabil Theory, Vienna, Austria::Filzmoser, Peter@Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geoinformat, Olomouc, Czech Republic@Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Stat & Probabil Theory, Vienna, Austria::Palarea-Albaladejo, Javier@Biomath & Stat Scotland, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Martin-Fernandez, Josep-Antoni@Universitat de Girona::Hron, Karel@Palacky University Olomouc::Templ, Matthias@Palacky University Olomouc@Vienna University of Technology::Filzmoser, Peter@Palacky University Olomouc@Vienna University of Technology::Palarea-Albaladejo, Javier@James Hutton Institute","Martin-Fernandez, Josep-Antoni@B-9208-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2366-1592::Palarea-Albaladejo, Javier@J-5591-2013","Biplots of compositional data+Aitchison, J; Greenacre, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2002::Compositional data analysis: Where are we and where should we be heading?+Aitchison, J; Egozcue, JJ+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+OCT 2005::no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::River Murray water quality monitoring program: Phytoplankton data trend analysis 1980-2008+Croome, R; Wheaton, L; Henderson, B<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Oliver, R</span>.+Technical Report, MDFRC Publication 06/2011, 81+2011::Groups of parts and their balances in compositional data analysis+Egozcue, JJ; Pawlowsky-Glahn, V+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+OCT 2005::Isometric logratio transformations for compositional data analysis+Egozcue, JJ; Pawlowsky-Glahn, V; Mateu-Figueras, G; et al.+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+APR 2003::Les elements aleatoires de nature quelconque dans un espace distancie+FRECHET, M.+Ann.

Sparse principal balances,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14535525,APR 2015,24,2,"Compositional data analysis deals with situations where the relevant information is contained only in the ratios between the measured variables, and not in the reported values. This article focuses on high-dimensional compositional data (in the sense of hundreds or even thousands of variables), as they appear in chemometrics (e.g., mass spectral data), proteomics or genomics. The goal of this contribution is to perform a dimension reduction of such data, where the new directions should allow for interpretability. An approach named principal balances turned out to be successful for low dimensions. Here, the concept of sparse principal component analysis is proposed for constructing principal directions, the so-called sparse principal balances. They are sparse (contain many zeros), build an orthonormal basis in the sample space of the compositional data, are efficient for dimension reduction and are applicable to high-dimensional data.","principal component analysis,compositional data,isometric logratio transformation,sparseness","COMPOSITIONAL DATA-ANALYSIS,ROUNDED ZEROS,STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,MARKOV-CHAINS,MISSING DATA,REGRESSION,DISTRIBUTIONS","Mert, Mehmet Can@Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Stat & Probabil Theory, A-1040 Vienna, Austria::Filzmoser, Peter@Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Stat & Probabil Theory, A-1040 Vienna, Austria::Hron, Karel@Palacky Univ, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, Fac Sci, CR-77147 Olomouc, Czech Republic@Palacky Univ, Dept Geoinformat, Fac Sci, CR-77147 Olomouc, Czech Republic","Mert, Mehmet Can@Vienna University of Technology::Filzmoser, Peter@Vienna University of Technology::Hron, Karel@Palacky University Olomouc",not exist,"THE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITIONAL DATA+AITCHISON, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::Mathematical Foundations of Compositional Data Analysis+Barcelo-Vidal, C; Martin-Fernandez, JA; Pawlowsky-Glahn, V.+P IAMG 01 7 ANN C IN+2001::no title+Blatt, H; Middleton, GV; Murray, RC.+Origin of sedimentary rocks+1972::EXPLAINING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CASELLA, G; GEORGE, EI+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::Groups of parts and their balances in compositional data analysis+Egozcue, JJ; Pawlowsky-Glahn, V+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+OCT 2005::Isometric logratio transformations for compositional data analysis+Egozcue, JJ; Pawlowsky-Glahn, V; Mateu-Figueras, G; et al.+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+APR 2003::A new class of skewed multivariate distributions with applications to regression analysis+Ferreira, Jose T.

Regression with compositional response having unobserved components or below detection limit values,STATISTICAL MODELLING,10.1177/1471082X14535527,APR 2015,21,4,"The typical way to deal with zeros and missing values in compositional data sets is to impute them with a reasonable value, and then the desired statistical model is estimated with the imputed data set, e.g., a regression model. This contribution aims at presenting alternative approaches to this problem within the framework of Bayesian regression with a compositional response. In the first step, a compositional data set with missing data is considered to follow a normal distribution on the simplex, which mean value is given as an Aitchison affine linear combination of some fully observed explanatory variables. Both the coefficients of this linear combination and the missing values can be estimated with standard Gibbs sampling techniques. In the second step, a normally distributed additive error is considered superimposed on the compositional response, and values are taken as 'below the detection limit' (BDL) if they are 'too small' in comparison with the additive standard deviation of each variable. Within this framework, the regression parameters and all missing values (including BDL) can be estimated with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Both methods estimate the regression coefficients without need of any preliminary imputation step, and adequately propagate the uncertainty derived from the fact that the missing values and BDL are not actually observed, something imputation methods cannot achieve.","Bayesian regression,compositional regression,missing values,nondetects,MCMC","NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,MIXTURES,SIMPLEX","van den Boogaart, Karl Gerald@Helmholtz Inst Freiberg Resources Technol, Dept Modelling & Valuat, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany@Tech Univ Bergakad Freiberg, Inst Stochast, D-09596 Freiberg, Germany::Tolosana-Delgado, Raimon@Helmholtz Inst Freiberg Resources Technol, Dept Modelling & Valuat, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany::Templ, Matthias@Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Stat & Probabil Theory, A-1040 Vienna, Austria","van den Boogaart, Karl Gerald@Technical University Freiberg::Tolosana-Delgado, Raimon@Unknow::Templ, Matthias@Vienna University of Technology",not exist,"LOG CONTRAST MODELS FOR EXPERIMENTS WITH MIXTURES+AITCHISON, J; BACONSHONE, J+BIOMETRIKA+1984::THE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITIONAL DATA+AITCHISON, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::KERNEL DENSITY-ESTIMATION FOR COMPOSITIONAL DATA+AITCHISON, J; LAUDER, IJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1985::no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::Compositional differential calculus on the simplex+Barcelo-Vidal, Carles; Antoni Martin-Fernandez, Josep; Mateu-Figueras, Gloria+COMPOSITIONAL DATA ANALYSIS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+2011::Gaussian kernels for density estimation with compositional data+Chacon, J.
