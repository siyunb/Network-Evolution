Spherical harmonics in quadratic forms for testing multivariate normality,TEST,10.1007/BF02595825,JUN 2001,19,3,"We study two statistics for testing goodness of fit to the null hypothesis of multivariate normality, based on averages over the standardized sample of multivariate spherical harmonics, radial functions and their products. These statistics (of which one was studied in the two-dimensional case in Quiroz and Dudley, 1991) have, as limiting distributions, linear combinations of chi-squares. In arbitrary dimension, we obtain closed form expressions for the coefficients that describe the limiting distributions, which allow us to produce Monte Carlo approximate limiting quantiles. We also obtain Monte Carlo approximate finite sample size quantiles and evaluate the power of the statistics presented against several alternatives of interest. A power comparison with other relevant statistics is included. The statistics proposed are easy to compute (with Fortran code available from the authors) and their finite sample quantiles converge relatively rapidly, with increasing sample size, to their limiting values, a behaviour that could be explained by the large number of orthogonal functions used in the quadratic forms involved.","empirical processes,hypothesis testing,multivariate normality,spherical harmonics",,"Manzotti, A@Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Comp Cientifico & Estadist, Caracas 1080, Venezuela@Univ Simon Bolivar, CESMA, Caracas 1080, Venezuela@Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Matemat, Caracas 1080, Venezuela::Quiroz, AJ@Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Comp Cientifico & Estadist, Caracas 1080, Venezuela@Univ Simon Bolivar, CESMA, Caracas 1080, Venezuela@Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Matemat, Caracas 1080, Venezuela","Manzotti, A@Simon Bolivar University@Simon Bolivar University@Simon Bolivar University::Quiroz, AJ@Simon Bolivar University@Simon Bolivar University@Simon Bolivar University","Quiroz, Adolfo@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4033-3400","LIMIT-THEOREMS FOR U-PROCESSES+ARCONES, MA; GINE, E+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+JUL 1993::A consistent test for multivariate normality based on the empirical characteristic function+Baringhaus, L.; Henze, N.+Metrika+1988::Data driven smooth tests for bivariate normality+Bogdan, M+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 1999::ADAPTIVE SMOOTHING AND DENSITY-BASED TESTS OF MULTIVARIATE NORMALITY+BOWMAN, AW; FOSTER, PJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::TESTING FOR NORMALITY IN ARBITRARY DIMENSION+CSORGO, S+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1986::Consistency of some tests for multivariate normality+Csorgo, S.+Metrika+1989::no title+Dudley, R.

The test is a generalization of the Girone-Cifarelli test (see Girone 1964, and Cifarelli 1974, 1975) which has been shown to be occasionally more powerful than other nonparametric tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The test is based on a measure of dissimilarity between the sequences of ranks corresponding to the samples drawn from the two populations. The test can be adapted to verify the hypothesis of equality against one-sided and two-sided alternatives. Exact and asymptotic critical values of the test are provided.

This extended model, inspired in sequentially planned decision procedures (Schmitz, 1993), is formulated in Section I and tries to exploit the reduction of costs produced by longer periods dedicated to the same activity. Following the method by Whittle (1980), Section 2 introduces a retirement option with a variable reward M, and Section 3 extends Gittins indexes to this case. Another relevant conclusion is that the optimal period of activity for each project does not depend on the retirement reward M. Finally, we show that the optimal strategy is to choose the project with the highest Gittins index.","multi-armed bandit processes,Gittins index",GITTINS INDEX,"Ibarrola, P@Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Dept Estad & IO, Madrid 28040, Spain@Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Estadist & IO, E-28040 Madrid, Spain::Velez, R@Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Dept Estad & IO, Madrid 28040, Spain@Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Estadist & IO, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Ibarrola, P@Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED)@Complutense University of Madrid::Velez, R@Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED)@Complutense University of Madrid",not exist,"Multi-armed bandits with switching penalties+Asawa, M; Teneketzis, D+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+MAR 1996::SWITCHING COSTS AND THE GITTINS INDEX+BANKS, JS; SUNDARAM, RK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1994::no title+FROSTIG E+4 PROOFS GITTINS MUL+1999::no title+Gihman, I.

Relative hazard rate estimation for right censored and left truncated data,TEST,10.1007/BF02595406,JUN 2005,17,4,In medical research differences among treatment groups are a common focus of study. The concept of relative hazard rate is a tool for comparing two groups in terms of their difference in risk rates. A kernel estimator is proposed in the case where both samples are subject to left truncation and right censoring and an iid representation is obtained in this setup. The asymptotic distribution and the asymptotic mean squared error of the estimator are obtained.

Convergence of the optimal m-estimator over a parametric family of m-estimators,TEST,10.1007/BF02595407,JUN 2005,25,3,"We consider a method to select an optimal M-estimator over a family of M-estimators of a parameter. Assuming that there exists an estimate of the mean square error for each element of this family of estimators, a natural estimator to consider is the M-estimator in the class which minimizes the considered estimates of the mean square errors. It is shown that under regularity conditions, this M-estimator is asymptotically normal and its asymptotic mean square error is equal to the infimum of the asymptotic mean square errors of the M-estimators in the class. We see how this method works in two different situations.

Nonstationary multivariate process modeling through spatially varying coregionalization,TEST,10.1007/BF02595775,DEC 2004,0,111,"Models for the analysis of multivariate spatial data are receiving increased attention these days. In many applications it will be preferable to work with multivariate spatial processes to specify such models. A critical specification in providing these models is the cross covariance function. Constructive approaches for developing valid cross-covariance functions offer the most practical strategy for doing this. These approaches include separability, kernel convolution or moving average methods, and convolution of covariance functions. We review these approaches but take as our main focus the computationally manageable class referred to as the linear model of coregionalization (LMC). We introduce a fully Bayesian development of the LMC. We offer clarification of the connection between joint and conditional approaches to fitting such models including prior specifications. However, to substantially enhance the usefulness of such modelling we propose the notion of a spatially varying LMC (SVLMC) providing a very rich class of multivariate nonstationary processes with simple interpretation. We illustrate the use of our proposed SVLMC with application to more than 600 commercial property transactions in three quite different real estate markets, Chicago, Dallas and San Diego. Bivariate nonstationary process models are developed for income from and selling price of the property.","cross-covariance function,linear model of coregionalization,matric-variate Wishart spatial process,prior parametrization,spatial range,spatially varying process model",,"Gelfand, AE@Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA@Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Matemat, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Connecticut, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Schmidt, AM@Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA@Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Matemat, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Connecticut, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Banerjee, S@Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA@Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Matemat, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Connecticut, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Sirmans, CF@Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA@Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Matemat, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Univ Connecticut, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Gelfand, AE@Duke University@Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@University of Connecticut::Schmidt, AM@Duke University@Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@University of Connecticut::Banerjee, S@Duke University@Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@University of Connecticut::Sirmans, CF@Duke University@Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@University of Connecticut","Schmidt, Alexandra@O-2301-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6448-6367",

The problem of simultaneous selection of two subsets, one containing population associated with the smallest theta - value and other containing population with the largest theta - value with probability at least a pre-specified value P* ((1)/(k(k-1))) < P* < 1) is considered when the data are censored.

Tests of independence and randomness based on the empirical copula process,TEST,10.1007/BF02595777,DEC 2004,40,105,"Deheuvels (1981a) described a decomposition of the empirical copula process into a finite number of asymptotically mutually independent sub-processes whose joint limiting distribution is tractable under the hypothesis that a multivariate distribution is equal to the product of its margins. It is proved here that this result can be extended to the serial case and that the limiting processes have the same joint distribution as in the non-serial setting. As a consequence, linear rank statistics have the same asymptotic distribution in both contexts. It is also shown how these facts can be exploited to construct simple statistics for detecting dependence graphically and testing it formally. Simulations are used to explore the finite-sample behavior of these statistics, which are found to be powerful against various types of alternatives.","Copula,Cramer-von Mises statistic,empirical process,Mobius inversion formula,pseudo-observations,semi-parametric models,serial dependence,tests of independence","SERIAL INDEPENDENCE,NONPARAMETRIC TEST,KENDALLS PROCESS,RANK-TESTS,DEPENDENCE","Genest, C@Univ Laval, Dept Math & Stat, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@HEC, Serv Enseignement Methodes Quantitat Gest, Montreal, PQ, Canada::Remillard, B@Univ Laval, Dept Math & Stat, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@HEC, Serv Enseignement Methodes Quantitat Gest, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Genest, C@Laval University@University of Montreal@HEC Montreal::Remillard, B@Laval University@University of Montreal@HEC Montreal",not exist,"On Kendall's process+Barbe, P; Genest, C; Ghoudi, K; et al.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 1996::DISTRIBUTION FREE TESTS OF INDEPENDENCE BASED ON SAMPLE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION+BLUM, JR; KIEFER, J; ROSENBLAT, M+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1961::Chaos, fractals and statistics+Chatterjee, S.; Yilmaz, M.+Statist.

Effect of outliers on forecasting temporally aggregated flow variables,TEST,10.1007/BF02595778,DEC 2004,24,3,"Economic time series are of two types: stock and flows, and may be available at different levels of aggregation (for instance, monthly or quarterly). The economist., in many situations, is interested in forecasting the aggregated observations. The forecast function, in this case, can be based either on the disaggregated series or the aggregated series. The forecasts based on the disaggregated data are at least as efficient, in terms of mean squared forecast errors, as the forecasts based on temporally aggregated observations when the data generating process (DGP) is a known ARIMA process. However, the effect of outliers on both forecast functions is not known. In this paper, we consider the effect of additive and innovation outliers on forecasting aggregated values based on aggregated and disaggregated models when the DGP is a known ARIMA process and the presence of the outliers is ignored. Results when the model is not known and tests applied for the detection of outliers are derived through simulation.","additive outliers,innovation outliers,forecasting,temporal aggregation","TIME-SERIES MODELS,ADDITIVE OUTLIERS,PARAMETERS","Hotta, LK@Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Stat, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil@Massey Univ, Palmerston North, New Zealand::Pereira, PLV@Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Stat, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil@Massey Univ, Palmerston North, New Zealand::Ota, R@Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Stat, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil@Massey Univ, Palmerston North, New Zealand","Hotta, LK@Universidade Estadual de Campinas@Massey University::Pereira, PLV@Universidade Estadual de Campinas@Massey University::Ota, R@Universidade Estadual de Campinas@Massey University","Hotta, Luiz@D-4985-2012::Valls Pereira, Pedro L.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3709-9564","BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF SOME OUTLIER PROBLEMS IN TIME-SERIES+ABRAHAM, B; BOX, GEP+BIOMETRIKA+1979::no title+AHSANULLAH M+P BUSINESS ECON STAT+1984::no title+BOX GEP+TIME SERIES ANAL+1976::ESTIMATION OF TIME-SERIES PARAMETERS IN THE PRESENCE OF OUTLIERS+CHANG, I; TIAO, GC; CHEN, C+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1988::FORECASTING TIME-SERIES WITH OUTLIERS+CHEN, C; LIU, LM+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JAN 1993::JOINT ESTIMATION OF MODEL PARAMETERS AND OUTLIER EFFECTS IN TIME-SERIES+CHEN, C; LIU, LM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Diagnosing shocks in time series+de Jong, P; Penzer, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1998::OUTLIERS IN TIME SERIES+FOX, AJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::TEMPORAL AGGREGATION AND SYSTEMATIC-SAMPLING IN STRUCTURAL TIME-SERIES MODELS+GONZALEZ, P+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JUN 1992::DIAGNOSTIC CHECKING OF UNOBSERVED-COMPONENTS TIME-SERIES MODELS+HARVEY, AC; KOOPMAN, SJ+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 1992::MONITORING AND ADJUSTING FORECASTS IN THE PRESENCE OF ADDITIVE OUTLIERS+HILLMER, S+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1984::The effect of aggregation on prediction in autoregressive integrated moving-average models+Hotta, LK; Cardosc Neto, J.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1993::ROBUST ESTIMATION OF POWER SPECTRA+KLEINER, B; MARTIN, RD; THOMSON, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1979::THE EFFECT OF ADDITIVE OUTLIERS ON THE FORECASTS FROM ARIMA MODELS+LEDOLTER, J+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1989::no title+LEDOLTER J+P BUS ECON STAT SECT+1987::Detecting possibly non-consecutive outliers in industrial time series+Luceno, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::FORECASTING TEMPORALLY AGGREGATED VECTOR ARMA PROCESSES+LUTKEPOHL, H+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+APR-JUN 1986::no title+LUTKEPOHL H+LECT NOTES ECON MATH+1987::no title+NOTTA L+INT J FORECASTING+1993::MODELING AND FORECASTING LINEAR-COMBINATIONS OF TIME-SERIES+PINO, FA; MORETTIN, PA; MENTZ, RP+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1987::no title+SCHMID W+J TIME SER ANAL+1996::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::Temporal aggregation in the arima process+Stram, D.O.; Wei, W.W.S.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1986::REALLOCATION OUTLIERS IN TIME-SERIES+WU, LSY; HOSKING, JRM; RAVISHANKER, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1993"
One- and two-sample prediction based on doubly censored exponential data and prior information,TEST,10.1007/BF02595779,DEC 2004,14,20,"On the basis of a doubly censored sample from an exponential lifetime distribution, the problem of predicting the lifetimes of the unfailed items (one-sample prediction), as well as a second independent future sample from the same distribution (two-sample prediction), is addressed in a Bayesian setting. A class of conjugate prior distributions, which includes Jeffreys' prior as a special case, is considered. Explicit expressions for predictive densities and survivals are derived. Assuming squared-error loss, Bayes predictive estimators are obtained in closed forms (in particular, the estimator of the number of failures in a specified future time interval is given analytically). Bayes prediction limits and predictive estimators tinder absolute-error loss can readily be computed using iterative methods. As applications, the total duration time in a life test and the failure time of a k-out-of-n system may be predicted. As an illustration, a numerical example is also included.","Bayes predictive estimators,Bayes prediction limits,failure time data,order statistics,Type UU censoring",,"Fernandez, AJ@Univ La Laguna, Dept Estad Invest Operat & COmputac, San Cristobal la Laguna 38271, Spain","Fernandez, AJ@Universidad de la Laguna","Fernandez, Arturo@I-2177-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2646-0905","no title+BARLOW RE+HDB STAT+1988::Estimation of a linear function of the parameters of an exponential distribution from doubly censored samples+Elfessi, A+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+DEC 15 1997::Estimation and Hypothesis Testing for Exponential Lifetime Models with Double Censoring and Prior Information+Fernandez, A.

This problem is solved for a class of random fields with reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm equivalent to the norm of a Sobolev space of an appropriate fractional order. More specifically, functional reconstruction and extrapolation formulae are derived from generalized wavelet-based orthogonal expansions of the input and output random fields in the class considered (see Angulo and Ruiz-Medina, 1999, for the ordinary case). In the Gaussian and ordinary case, the results derived also provide sample-path functional reconstruction and extrapolation fomulae.

On intrinsic priors for nonnested models,TEST,10.1007/BF02595781,DEC 2004,23,7,"Model selection problems involving nonnested models are considered. Bayes factor based solution to these problems needs prior distributions for the parameters in the alternative models. When the prior information on these parameters is vague default priors are available but, unfortunately, these priors are usually improper which yields a calibration problem that makes the Bayes factor to be defined up to a multiplicative constant. Intrinsic priors have been introduced for solving this difficulty. While these priors are well established for nested models, their construction for nonnested models is still an open problem.

In this latter setting this paper studies the system of functional equations that defines the intrinsic priors. It is shown that the solutions to these equations are obtained from the solutions to a single homogeneous linear functional equation. The Bayes factors associated with these solutions are analyzed. Some illustrative examples are provided and, in particular, location, scale, and location-scale models are considered.","Bayes factor,intrinsic priors,nonnested models,Schroder equation","BAYES FACTORS,HYPOTHESES,SELECTION","Cano, JA@Univ Murcia, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-30001 Murcia, Spain@Univ Granada, Dept Stat, E-18071 Granada, Spain::Kessler, M@Univ Murcia, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-30001 Murcia, Spain@Univ Granada, Dept Stat, E-18071 Granada, Spain::Moreno, E@Univ Murcia, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-30001 Murcia, Spain@Univ Granada, Dept Stat, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Cano, JA@University of Murcia@University of Granada::Kessler, M@University of Murcia@University of Granada::Moreno, E@University of Murcia@University of Granada","Kessler, Mathieu@L-7580-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0196-5811","Testing precise hypotheses+Berger, J.

Intermittent estimation of stationary time series,TEST,10.1007/BF02595785,DEC 2004,27,8,"Let {X-n}(n=0)(infinity) be a stationary real-valued time series with unknown distribution. Our goal is to estimate the conditional expectation of Xn+1 based on the observations X-i, 0 less than or equal to i less than or equal to n in a strongly consistent way. Bailey and Ryabko proved that this is not possible even for ergodic binary time series if one estimates at all values of n. We propose a very simple algorithm which will make prediction infinitely often at carefully selected stopping times chosen by our rule. We show that under certain conditions our procedure is strongly (pointwise) consistent, and L-2 consistent without any condition. An upper bound on the growth of the stopping times is also presented in this paper.","nonparametric estimation,stationary processes","UNIVERSAL SCHEMES,CONSISTENCY,PREDICTION","Morvai, G@Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Grp Informat & Elect, H-1521 Budapest, Hungary@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel::Weiss, B@Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Grp Informat & Elect, H-1521 Budapest, Hungary@Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","Morvai, G@Hungarian Academy of Sciences@Hebrew University of Jerusalem::Weiss, B@Hungarian Academy of Sciences@Hebrew University of Jerusalem","Morvai, Gusztav@H-8854-2012","UNIVERSAL SCHEMES FOR PREDICTION, GAMBLING AND PORTFOLIO SELECTION+ALGOET, P+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+APR 1992::Universal schemes for learning the best nonlinear predictor given the infinite past and side information+Algoet, P+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+MAY 1999::THE STRONG LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS FOR SEQUENTIAL DECISIONS UNDER UNCERTAINTY+ALGOET, PH+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+MAY 1994::no title+ASH R+REAL ANAL PROPBABILI+1972::no title+BAILEY DH+THESIS STANFORD U+1976::no title+COVER T+ELEMENTS INFORMATION+1991::Open problems in information theory+Cover, T.M.+1975 IEEE JOINT WORK+1975::The consistency of the BIC Markov order estimator+Csiszar, I; Shields, PC+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2000::Large-scale typicality of Markov sample paths and consistency of MDL order estimators+Csiszar, I+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+JUN 2002::no title+Gray, R.

Families of distributions arising from distributions of order statistics,TEST,10.1007/BF02602999,JUN 2004,70,158,"Consider starting from a symmetric distribution F on R and generating a family of distributions from it by employing two parameters whose role is to introduce skewness and to vary tail weight. The proposal in this paper is a simple generalisation of the use of the collection of order statistic distributions associated with F for this purpose; an alternative derivation of this family of distributions is as the result of applying the inverse probability integral transformation to the beta distribution. General properties of the proposed family of distributions are explored. It is argued that two particular special cases are especially attractive because they appear to provide the most tractable instances of families with power and exponential tails; these are the skew t distribution and the log F distribution, respectively. Limited experience with fitting the distributions to data in their four-parameter form, with location and scale parameters added, is described; and hopes for their incorporation into complex modelling situations expressed. Extensions to the multivariate case and to R+ are discussed; and links are forged between the distributions underlying the skew t and log F distributions and Tadikamalla and Johnson's L-U family.","Beta distribution,log F distribution,LU distribution,order statistics,probability integral transform,skew t distribution","GENERALIZED EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTIONS,T-DISTRIBUTION,BETA DISTRIBUTION,MULTIVARIATE T,F DISTRIBUTION,MODELS,GAMMA,REGRESSION,VARIABLES,WEIBULL","Jones, MC@Open Univ, Dept Stat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England","Jones, MC@Open University - UK","Jones, Chris@A-3687-2009","no title+Arnold, B.

On the association between a random parameter and an observable,TEST,10.1007/BF02603002,JUN 2004,16,7,"The association between an observable and a random parameter characterizes their joint distribution given the marginal distributions. It has been shown to be incorporated in the (log-)odds ratio function. The association is inherent in each of the conditional distributions and hence determines the learning process formalized in Bayes' theorem. The paper focuses on two applications. Commonly used measures of dependence; especially Kullback-Leibler distances between densities of interest are identified and interpreted as expected values of the log-odds ratio function. Frequently Bayesian inference is based on the maximization of an expected utility. If the utility of a probability density is defined by the logarithmic score function; the expected utility can often be decomposed approximately into a term of ""fit"" and a term of ""model complexity"". The log-odds ratio parameterization of probability densities reveals that ""model complexity"" again can be defined as an expected value of the log-odds ratio function; i.e., as a measure of dependence between the observable and the random parameter. The ideas are illustrated throughout with examples from the class of conjugate exponential families.","odds ratio,expected information,expected utility,hypothesis testing,model choice,model complexity",INFORMATION,"van der Linde, A@Univ Bremen, Inst Stat, FB 3, D-28834 Bremen, Germany","van der Linde, A@University of Bremen",not exist,"The Choice of Variables in Probabilistic Classification+Bernardo, J.

Averages of Hill estimators,TEST,NO DOI,JUN 2004,16,7,Averaging Hill's estimators leads to a reduction in the volatility of Hill's plot. We deal with a generalization of the procedure proposed by Resnick and Starica (1997); and propose alternatives; asymptotically equivalent at the respective optimal levels; but with more interesting sample paths. Asymptotic normality is derived for intermediate levels where the asymptotic bias may be non-null. A simulation study completes the asymptotic results and shows the advantages of the proposed estimators in the problem of choosing the number of the top order statistics to be used in the estimation of the tail index.,"heavy tails,Hill estimator,regular variation,asymptotic efficiency,simulation","EXTREME-VALUE ESTIMATION,TAIL INDEX ESTIMATION,SAMPLE FRACTION","Martins, MJ@Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Sup Agron, Dept Matemat, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lisbon, DEIO, Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lisbon, CEAUL, Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Sup Agron, Dept Matemat, Lisbon, Portugal::Gomes, MI@Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Sup Agron, Dept Matemat, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lisbon, DEIO, Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lisbon, CEAUL, Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Sup Agron, Dept Matemat, Lisbon, Portugal::Neves, MM@Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Sup Agron, Dept Matemat, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lisbon, DEIO, Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lisbon, CEAUL, Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Sup Agron, Dept Matemat, Lisbon, Portugal","Martins, MJ@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa::Gomes, MI@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa::Neves, MM@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa","Gomes, Ivette@N-4326-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2903-6993::Neves, Manuela@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2468-3857::Martins, Maria Joao@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1328-7579","Tail index estimation, pareto quantile plots, and regression diagnostics+Beirlant, J; Vynckier, P; Teugels, JL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::Using a bootstrap method to choose the sample fraction in tail index estimation+Danielsson, J; de Haan, L; Peng, L; et al.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+FEB 2001::OPTIMAL CHOICE OF SAMPLE FRACTION IN EXTREME-VALUE ESTIMATION+DEKKERS, ALM; DEHAAN, L+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+NOV 1993::A bootstrap-based method to achieve optimality in estimating the extreme-value index+Draisma, G.; de Haan, L.; Peng, L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Pereira, T.

The prior imposed on the wavelet coefficients is based upon a Pareto distribution. We introduce weak Besov spaces that enable us to measure the sparsity of each estimated signal. At first, we establish a. relationship between the parameters of the prior and the parameters of the weak Besov space in which the realizations built from the prior lie. Subsequently, we exhibit a thresholding rule which threshold at each resolution level depends on the prior parameters.

A procedure for outlier identification in data sets from continuous distributions,TEST,10.1007/BF02603008,JUN 2004,16,0,"We propose a procedure, based on sums of reciprocals of p-values, for the identification of outliers in univariate or multivariate data sets coming from continuous distributions. Using results of Csorgo (1990), we find the limiting distribution of the relevant statistic for completely specified models. By simulations, we obtain approximate quartiles for the asymptotic distribution (which does not depend on the specific model or the dimension where the data live) and for the finite sample distribution in different dimensions of our statistic when parameters are estimated; for the multivariate Gaussian model and a multivariate double exponential model with independent coordinates. Monte Carlo evaluation shows that the procedure proposed is effective in the identification of outliers, and that it is sensitive to sample size, a feature seldom found in outlier identification methods.","outlier identification,St. Petersburg paradox,continuous distributions",,"Balakrishnan, N@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON, Canada@Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Comp Cient & Estadist, Caracas 1080, Venezuela::Quiroz, AJ@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON, Canada@Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Comp Cient & Estadist, Caracas 1080, Venezuela","Balakrishnan, N@McMaster University@Simon Bolivar University::Quiroz, AJ@McMaster University@Simon Bolivar University","Quiroz, Adolfo@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4033-3400","no title+ARNOLD BC+LECT NOTES STAT+1959::Maximum likelihood estimation of Laplace parameters based on Type-II censored samples+Balakrishnan, N; Cutler, CD.+Statistical theory and applications. papers in honor of Herbert A.

Statistics and causal inference: A review,TEST,10.1007/BF02595718,DEC 2003,0,46,"This paper aims at assisting empirical researchers benefit from recent advances in causal inference. The paper stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, and the conditional nature of causal claims inferred from nonexperimental studies. These emphases are illustrated through a brief survey of recent results, including the control of confounding, the assessment of causal effects, the interpretation of counterfactuals, and a symbiosis between counterfactual and graphical methods of analysis.","structural equation models,confounding,noncompliance,graphical methods,counterfactuals",,"Pearl, J@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Comp Sci, Cognit Syst Lab, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Pearl, J@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles",not exist,

A Bayesian semiparametric analysis for additive hazard models with censored observations,TEST,10.1007/BF02595719,DEC 2003,26,3,"The hazard function, also called the risk function or intensity function, is usually used to model survival data or other waiting times, such as unemployment times. In contrast to the proportional hazard model, the additive risk model assumes that the hazard function is the sum of, rather than the product of, the baseline hazard function and a non-negative function of covariates. We propose to introduce the covariates into the model through a Gamma hazard function, while the baseline hazard function is left unspecified. Following the Bayesian paradigm, we obtain an approximation to the posterior distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. The subject-specific survival estimation is also studied. A real example using unemployment data is provided.","additive risk models,hierarchical models,MCMC methods,non-proportional hazards,predictive distributions,survival data,unemployment data","GIBBS SAMPLER,RISK MODEL,REGRESSION,DISTRIBUTIONS","Beamonte, E@Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ, E-46003 Valencia, Spain@Univ Valencia, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-46003 Valencia, Spain::Bermudez, JD@Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ, E-46003 Valencia, Spain@Univ Valencia, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-46003 Valencia, Spain","Beamonte, E@University of Valencia@University of Valencia::Bermudez, JD@University of Valencia@University of Valencia","Bermudez, Jose@L-1147-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4699-5923","no title+AALEN OO+MODEL NONPARAMETRIC+1980::A LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL FOR THE ANALYSIS OF LIFE TIMES+AALEN, OO+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 1989::no title+BEAMONTE E+THESIS U VALENCIA+1998::Training and the time to find a job in Israel+Beenstock, M+APPLIED ECONOMICS+AUG 1996::no title+BEST NG+CODA MANUAL VERSION+1995::ADDITIVE AND MULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR RELATIVE SURVIVAL RATES+BUCKLEY, JD+BIOMETRICS+1984::EXPLAINING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CASELLA, G; GEORGE, EI+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation methods in econometrics+Chib, S; Greenberg, E+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 1996::no title+Cox, DR; Oakes, D.+Analysis of Survival Data+1984::PARTIAL LIKELIHOOD+COX, DR+BIOMETRIKA+1975::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::no title+DeGroot, M.+Optimal Statistical Decisions+1970::PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS, UNEMPLOYMENT-INSURANCE, AND THE DURATION OF UNEMPLOYMENT+FOLLMANN, DA; GOLDBERG, MS; MAY, L+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 1990::no title+GAMERMAN D+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1991::SAMPLING-BASED APPROACHES TO CALCULATING MARGINAL DENSITIES+GELFAND, AE; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::STOCHASTIC RELAXATION, GIBBS DISTRIBUTIONS, AND THE BAYESIAN RESTORATION OF IMAGES+GEMAN, S; GEMAN, D+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+1984::no title+GEWEKE J+J ECONOMETRICS+1998::no title+Gilks, W.; Richardson, S.; Spiegelhalter, D.+Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice+1996::CONTESTED TENDER OFFERS - AN ESTIMATE OF THE HAZARD FUNCTION+JAGGIA, S; THOSAR, S+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1995::Two-sample goodness-of-fit tests for additive risk models with censored observations+Kim, JH; Lee, SY+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::Additive hazards regression with current status data+Lin, DY; Oakes, D; Ying, ZL+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1998::SEMIPARAMETRIC ANALYSIS OF THE ADDITIVE RISK MODEL+LIN, DY; YING, ZL+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1994::A PARTLY PARAMETRIC ADDITIVE RISK MODEL+MCKEAGUE, IW; SASIENI, PD+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::Semiparametric Bayesian analysis of survival data+Sinha, D; Dey, DK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::BAYESIAN COMPUTATION VIA THE GIBBS SAMPLER AND RELATED MARKOV-CHAIN MONTE-CARLO METHODS+SMITH, AFM; ROBERTS, GO+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1993::MARKOV-CHAINS FOR EXPLORING POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS+TIERNEY, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1994"

Robust trend parameters in a multivariate spatial linear model,TEST,10.1007/BF02595724,DEC 2003,15,4,"This article gives a robust estimator of the trend parameters in multivariate spatial linear models. This estimator is presented as an alternative to the classical one which is obtained by using cokriging. The goal focuses on improving predictions of spatial variables when data contain both atypical and high influence observations. The procedure consists of extending robust methods used in linear regression models to the multivariate spatial context. The resulting estimator belongs to the class of GM-estimators and then, it is a bounded influence estimator and it has good robust properties, in particular, a high breakdown point and a high efficiency. An illustrative example is given to show how the proposed estimator works.","cokriging,atypical observations,high leverage points,tessellation","REGRESSION,ESTIMATOR","Militino, AF@Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Pamplona 31006, Spain::Palacios, MB@Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Pamplona 31006, Spain::Ugarte, MD@Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Pamplona 31006, Spain","Militino, AF@Universidad Publica de Navarra::Palacios, MB@Universidad Publica de Navarra::Ugarte, MD@Universidad Publica de Navarra","Ugarte, Maria Dolores@J-8834-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3505-8400::Palacios, MB@K-3763-2014::Militino, Ana F@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0631-3919::Palacios, M.

On discrete Multivariate distributions symmetric in frequencies,TEST,10.1007/BF02595725,DEC 2003,21,2,In this paper we describe a new class of discrete multivariate distributions which verify that their probability mass function is invariant when their univariate variables are permuted. These distributions may be generated by a multivariate extension of the Gauss function F-2(1) with matrix argument. A methodology that permits the fit of these distributions to real data is developed. A fit of a distribution for bivariate real data is shown and is compared with fits obtained by means of other usual bivariate distributions generated by extensions of the Gauss function.,"Gaussian hypergeometric function,multivariate discrete distributions,zonal polynomials,medical data","LATENT ROOTS,MATRIX","Rodriguez, J@Univ Jaen, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Jaen 23071, Spain::Conde, A@Univ Jaen, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Jaen 23071, Spain::Saez, AJ@Univ Jaen, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Jaen 23071, Spain::Olmo, MJ@Univ Jaen, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Jaen 23071, Spain","Rodriguez, J@Universidad de Jaen::Conde, A@Universidad de Jaen::Saez, AJ@Universidad de Jaen::Olmo, MJ@Universidad de Jaen","Rodriguez-Avi, Jose@I-2468-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1673-9876::Saez-Castillo, Antonio Jose@B-5948-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9795-9610::Conde Sanchez, Antonio@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0450-1585","no title+Balakrishnan, N.; Kotz, S.; Johnson, N.

Some new formulae for posterior expectations and Bartlett corrections,TEST,NO DOI,DEC 2003,16,6,"Some new accurate approximations for posterior expectations and Bartlett corrections are derived. These approximations are modifications of formulae based on signed root log-likelihood ratios obtained in Sweeting (1996) and are designed to address two problems that arise in the practical application of these formulae in the multiparameter case. The first problem is a computational one associated with inversion of signed root log-likelihood ratios. The second concerns the form of the posterior expectation formula, which is not in a particularly convenient form for the computation of predictive densities. The theory is illustrated by two examples.","approximate Bayesian inference,Bayesian Bartlett correction,higher-order asymptotics,Laplace approximation,predictive distribution,signed root log-likelihood ratio","MARGINAL TAIL PROBABILITIES,DATA AUGMENTATION,CENSORED-DATA,APPROXIMATIONS,INFERENCE","Sweeting, MEJ@UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England@Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England::Kharroubi, SA@UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England@Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England","Sweeting, MEJ@University College London@University of London@University of Sheffield::Kharroubi, SA@University College London@University of London@University of Sheffield",not exist,"no title+BARNDORFFNIELSE.OE+ASYMPTOTIC TECHNIQUE+1989::no title+CRAWFORD DE+INSULATION CURCUITS+1970::APPROXIMATIONS OF MARGINAL TAIL PROBABILITIES FOR A CLASS OF SMOOTH FUNCTIONS WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN AND CONDITIONAL INFERENCE+DICICCIO, TJ; MARTIN, MA+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1991::AN ACCURATE METHOD FOR APPROXIMATE CONDITIONAL AND BAYESIAN-INFERENCE ABOUT LINEAR-REGRESSION MODELS FROM CENSORED-DATA+DICICCIO, TJ; FIELD, CA+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1991::APPROXIMATIONS OF MARGINAL TAIL PROBABILITIES AND INFERENCE FOR SCALAR PARAMETERS+DICICCIO, TJ; FIELD, CA; FRASER, DAS+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1990::SIMPLE METHOD FOR REGRESSION-ANALYSIS WITH CENSORED DATA+SCHMEE, J; HAHN, GJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1979::Approximate Bayesian computation based on signed roots of log-density ratios (with discussion)+Sweeting, T.J.+Bayesian Statistics+1996::no title+SWEETING TJ+BAYESIAN STAT+1992::A FRAMEWORK FOR BAYESIAN AND LIKELIHOOD APPROXIMATIONS IN STATISTICS+SWEETING, TJ+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1995::no title+SWEETING TJ+J ROY STAT SOC+1992::THE CALCULATION OF POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS BY DATA AUGMENTATION+TANNER, MA; WING, HW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1987::no title+Tanner, MA.+Tools for statistical inference: methods for the exploration of posterior distributions and likelihood functions+1996::FULLY EXPONENTIAL LAPLACE APPROXIMATIONS TO EXPECTATIONS AND VARIANCES OF NONPOSITIVE FUNCTIONS+TIERNEY, L; KASS, RE; KADANE, JB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1989::ACCURATE APPROXIMATIONS FOR POSTERIOR MOMENTS AND MARGINAL DENSITIES+TIERNEY, L; KADANE, JB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1986::A MONTE-CARLO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EM ALGORITHM AND THE POOR MANS DATA AUGMENTATION ALGORITHMS+WEI, GCG; TANNER, MA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1990::POSTERIOR COMPUTATIONS FOR CENSORED REGRESSION DATA+WEI, GCG; TANNER, MA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1990"
Resampling-based multiple testing for microarray data analysis,TEST,10.1007/BF02595811,JUN 2003,60,217,"The burgeoning field of genomics has revived interest in multiple testing procedures by raising new methodological and computational challenges. For example, microarray experiments generate large multiplicity problems in which thousands of hypotheses are tested simultaneously. Westfall and Young (1993) propose resampling-based p-value adjustment procedures which are highly relevant to microarray experiments. This article discusses different criteria for error control in resampling-based multiple testing, including (a) the family wise error rate of Westfall and Young (1993) and (b) the false discovery rate developed by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), both from a frequentist viewpoint; and (c) the positive false discovery rate of Storey (2002a), which has a Bayesian motivation. We also introduce our recently developed fast algorithm for implementing the minP adjustment to control family-wise error rate. Adjusted p-values for different approaches are applied to gene expression data from two recently published microarray studies. The properties of these procedures for multiple testing are compared.","multiple testing,family-wise error rate,false discovery rate,adjusted p-value,fast algorithm,minP,microarray","FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES,OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ARRAYS,PATTERNS,CONFIDENCE,DISTRIBUTIONS,STATISTICS,VARIANCE,CANCER,RATES","Ge, YC@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Div Genet & Bioinformat, Parkville, Vic, Australia::Dudoit, S@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Div Genet & Bioinformat, Parkville, Vic, Australia::Speed, TP@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Div Genet & Bioinformat, Parkville, Vic, Australia","Ge, YC@University of California Berkeley@University of California System@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@Walter & Eliza Hall Institute::Dudoit, S@University of California Berkeley@University of California System@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@Walter & Eliza Hall Institute::Speed, TP@University of California Berkeley@University of California System@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@Walter & Eliza Hall Institute","Speed, Terence@B-8085-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5403-7998","Distinct types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identified by gene expression profiling+Alizadeh, AA; Eisen, MB; Davis, RE; et al.+NATURE+FEB 3 2000::Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays+Alon, U; Barkai, N; Notterman, DA; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+JUN 8 1999::John W.

Suitable truncated beta distributions are used throughout in a common conjugate prior structure to obtain the Bayes estimates for the proportion of a ""sensitive"" attribute in the population of interest. The results of this common conjugate prior approach are contrasted with those of Winkler and Franklin's (1979), in which non-conjugate priors have been used in the context of Warner's model. The results are illustrated numerically in several cases and exemplified further with data reported in Liu and Chow (1976) concerning incidents of induced abortions.","Bayesian estimation,beta distribution,maximum likelihood estimator",,"Bar-Lev, SK@Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel@IUPUI, Dept Math Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA::Bobovich, E@Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel@IUPUI, Dept Math Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA::Boukai, B@Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel@IUPUI, Dept Math Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Bar-Lev, SK@University of Haifa@Indiana University System@Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis::Bobovich, E@University of Haifa@Indiana University System@Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis::Boukai, B@University of Haifa@Indiana University System@Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis",not exist,"no title+Berger, JO.+Statistical decision theory and bayesian analysis+1980::Using randomized response from a complex survey to estimate a sensitive proportion in a dichotomous finite population+Chaudhuri, A+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1 2001::no title+Chaudhuri, A.; Mukerjee, R.+Randomized Response: Theory and Techniques+1988::Procuring honest responses indirectly+Chua, TC; Tsui, AK+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1 2000::NOTE ON RANDOMIZED RESPONSE TECHNIQUE+DEVORE, JL+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1977::Do they lie?+Diskin, A.; Felsenthal, D.+International Political Science Review+1981::COMPARISON OF 2 RANDOMIZED RESPONSE SURVEY METHODS WITH CONSIDERATION FOR LEVEL OF RESPONDENT PROTECTION+FLIGNER, MA; POLICELLO, GE; SINGH, J+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1977::no title+Fox, J.A.; Tacy, P.E.+Randomized Response : A Method for Sensitive Survey+1986::UNRELATED QUESTION RANDOMIZED RESPONSE MODEL - THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK+GREENBERG, BG; ABULELA, ALA; SIMMONS, WR; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::no title+HOROVITZ DG+INT STAT REV+1976::The unrelated question randomized response model+Horvitz, D.G; Shah, B.V.; Simmons, W.R.+P SOC STAT SECT AM S+1967::A TEST FOR DETECTING UNTRUTHFUL ANSWERING IN RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE PROCEDURES+LAKSHMI, DV; RAGHAVARAO, D+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 1992::EFFICIENCY OF MULTIPLE TRIAL RANDOMIZED RESPONSE TECHNIQUE+LIU, PT; CHOW, LP+BIOMETRICS+1976::ON MOORS RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE MODEL+MANGAT, NS; SINGH, R; SINGH, S; et al.+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1993::AN ALTERNATIVE RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE PROCEDURE+MANGAT, NS; SINGH, R+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1990::Randomized response revisited+Padmawar, VR; Vijayan, K+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 2000::ESTIMATION PROBLEM IN WARNERS RANDOMIZED RESPONSE TECHNIQUE+RAGHAVARAO, D+BIOMETRICS+1978::A note on RR techniques+Singh, J.+Proceedings of the survey research method section of the American Statistical Association+1976::A note on maximum likelihood estimation from randomized response models+Singh, J.+P SOC STAT SECT AM S+1978::RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE - A SURVEY TECHNIQUE FOR ELIMINATING EVASIVE ANSWER BIAS+WARNER, SL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1965::WARNER RANDOMIZED RESPONSE MODEL - BAYESIAN-APPROACH+WINKLER, RL; FRANKLIN, LA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979"

Power and sample size calculation for 2x2 tables under multinomial sampling with random loss,TEST,10.1007/BF02595816,JUN 2003,15,0,"Multinomial sampling, in which the total number of sampled subjects is fixed, is probably one of the most commonly used sampling schemes in categorical data analysis. When we apply multinomial sampling to collect subjects who are subject to a random exclusion from our data analysis, the number of subjects falling into each comparison group is random and can be small with a positive probability. Thus, the application of the traditional statistics derived from large sample theory for testing equality between two independent proportions can sometimes be theoretically invalid. On the other hand, using Fisher's exact test can always assure that the true type I error is less than or equal to a nominal a-level. Thus, we discuss here power and sample size calculation based on this exact test. For a desired power at a given a-level, we develop an exact sample size calculation procedure, that accounts for a random loss of sampled subjects, for testing equality. between two independent proportions under multinomial sampling. Because the exact sample size calculation procedure requires intensive computations when the underlying required sample size is large, we also present an approximate sample size formula using large sample theory. On the basis of Monte Carlo simulation, we note that the power of using this approximate sample size formula generally agrees well with the desired power on the basis of the exact test. Finally, we propose a trial-and-error procedure using the approximate sample size as an initial estimate and Monte Carlo simulation to expedite the procedure for searching the minimum required sample size.","sample size determination,Fisher's exact test,multinomial sampling,power","PROPORTIONS,TRIALS","Lui, KJ@San Diego State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, San Diego, CA 92182 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biostat, Los Angeles, CA USA::Cumberland, WG@San Diego State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, San Diego, CA 92182 USA@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biostat, Los Angeles, CA USA","Lui, KJ@California State University System@San Diego State University@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System::Cumberland, WG@California State University System@San Diego State University@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"ON THE POWER FUNCTION OF THE EXACT TEST FOR THE 2X2 CONTINGENCY TABLE+BENNETT, BM; HSU, P+BIOMETRIKA+1960::no title+Bishop, Y.

Bayesian approach to parameter estimation of the generalized pareto distribution,TEST,NO DOI,JUN 2003,13,14,"Several methods have been used for estimating the parameters of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), namely maximum likelihood (ML), the method of moments (MOM) and the probability-weighted moments (PWM). It is known that for these estimators to exist, certain constraints have to be imposed on the range of the shape parameter, k, of the GPD. For instance, PWM and ML estimators only exist for k > -0.5 and k less than or equal to 1, respectively. Moreover, and particularly for small sample sizes, the most efficient method to apply in any practical situation highly depends on a previous knowledge of the most likely values of k. This clearly suggests the use of Bayesian techniques as a way of using prior information on k. In the present work, we address the issue of estimating the parameters of the GPD from a Bayesian point of view. The proposed approach is compared via a simulation study with ML, PWM and also with the elemental percentile method (EPM) which was developed by Castillo and Hadi (1997). The estimation procedure is then applied to two real data sets.","elemental percentile method,Gibbs sampling,generalized Pareto distribution,maximum likelihood,peaks over threshold,probability-weighted moments",,"Bermudez, PD@Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Estatist & Invest Operac, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal::Turkman, MAA@Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Estatist & Invest Operac, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal","Bermudez, PD@Universidade de Lisboa::Turkman, MAA@Universidade de Lisboa","de Zea Bermudez, Patricia@G-8027-2015::Amaral Turkman, Maria Antonia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7564-7154","BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION AND PREDICTION FOR PARETO DATA+ARNOLD, BC; PRESS, SJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1989::no title+Beirlant, J.; Teugels, J.; Vynckier, P.+Practical analysis of extreme values+1996::no title+BERMUDEZ PD+7 CEAUL U LISB+2001::no title+Best, N.

Spatial-temporal nonlinear filtering based on hierarchical statistical models - Discussion,TEST,10.1007/BF02595708,DEC 2002,0,5,"A hierarchical statistical model is made up generically of a data model, a process model, and occasionally a prior model for all the unknown parameters. The process model, known as the state equations in the filtering literature, is where most of the scientist's physical/chemical/biological knowledge about the problem is used. In the case of a dynamically changing configuration of objects moving through a spatial domain of interest, that knowledge is summarized through equations of motion with random perturbations. In this paper, our interest is in dynamically filtering noisy observations on these objects, where the state equations are nonlinear. Two recent methods of filtering, the Unscented Particle filter (UPF) and the Unscented Kalman filter, are presented and compared to the better known Extended Kalman filter. Other sources of nonlinearity arise when we wish to estimate nonlinear functions of the objects positions; it is here where the UPF shows its superiority, since optimal estimates and associated variances are straightforward to obtain. The longer computing time needed for the UPF is often not a big issue, with the ever faster processors that are available. This paper is a review of spatial-temporal nonlinear filtering, and we illustrate it in a Command and Control setting where the objects are highly mobile weapons, and the nonlinear function of object locations is a two-dimensional surface known as the danger-potential field.","battlespace,danger-potential field,Kalman filter,particle filter,resampling,scaled unscented transformation,sequential importance sampler,unscented particle filter",,"Irwin, ME@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Cressie, N@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Johannesson, G@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Irwin, ME@Ohio State University::Cressie, N@Ohio State University::Johannesson, G@Ohio State University","Cressie, Noel@B-8858-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0274-8050",
A semiparametric model for compositional data analysis in presence of covariates on the simplex,TEST,10.1007/BF02595709,DEC 2002,28,1,"Compositional data occur as natural realizations of multivariate observations comprising element proportions of some whole quantity. Such observations predominate in disciplines like geology, biology, ecology, economics and chemistry. Due to unit sum constraint on compositional data, specialized statistical methods are required for analyzing these data. Dirichlet distributions were originally used to study compositional data even though this family of distribution is not appropriate (see Aitchison, 1986) because of their extreme independence properties. Aitchison (1982) endeavored to provide a viable alternative to existing methods by employing Logistic Normal distribution to analyze such constrained data. However this family does not include the Dirichlet class and is therefore unable to address the issue of extreme independence. In this paper generalized Lionville family is investigated to model compositional data which includes covariates. This class permits distributions that admit negative or mixed correlation and also contains non-Dirichlet distributions with non-positive correlation and overcomes deficits in the Dirichlet class. Semiparametric Bayesian methods are proposed to estimate the probability density. Predictive distributions are used to assess performance of the model. The methods are illustrated on a real data set.","compositional data,Markov chain Monte Carlo methods,posterior predictive distribution,semiparametric density estimation","SURVIVAL-DATA,LIOUVILLE DISTRIBUTIONS,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS","Iyengar, M@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA@SmithKline Beecham Pharm, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA::Dey, DK@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA@SmithKline Beecham Pharm, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA","Iyengar, M@University of Connecticut@GlaxoSmithKline::Dey, DK@University of Connecticut@GlaxoSmithKline",not exist,"A GENERAL-CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE SIMPLEX+AITCHISON, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1985::THE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITIONAL DATA+AITCHISON, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike+1998::SOME PARAMETRIC MODELS ON THE SIMPLEX+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, OE; JORGENSEN, B+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 1991::no title+BHANSALI RJ+BIOMETRIKA+1977::COVARIANCE ANALYSIS OF CENSORED SURVIVAL DATA+BRESLOW, N+BIOMETRICS+1974::SEDIMENTATION IN AN ARCTIC LAKE+COAKLEY, JP; RUST, BR+JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY+1968::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::no title+Devroye, L.+Non -Uniform Random Variate Generation+1986::no title+EDWARDS J+TREATISE INTEGRAL CA+1922::DYNAMIC MODELING AND PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION FOR DISCRETE-TIME SURVIVAL-DATA+FAHRMEIR, L+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1994::no title+GELFAND A+BIOMETRICS+1995::no title+GELFAND AE+P 4 VAL INT M BAYES+1992::no title+GUPTA R+J MULTIVARIATE ANAL+1987::MULTIVARIATE LIOUVILLE DISTRIBUTIONS .3.+GUPTA, RD; RICHARDS, DS+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 1992::no title+GUPTA RD+PROBABILITY MATH STA+1992::MONTE-CARLO SAMPLING METHODS USING MARKOV CHAINS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+HASTINGS, WK+BIOMETRIKA+1970::Box-Cox transformations in Bayesian analysis of compositional data+Iyengar, M; Dey, DK+ENVIRONMETRICS+NOV-DEC 1998::EQUATION OF STATE CALCULATIONS BY FAST COMPUTING MACHINES+METROPOLIS, N; ROSENBLUTH, AW; ROSENBLUTH, MN; et al.+JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS+1953::GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS+NELDER, JA; WEDDERBURN, RW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-GENERAL+1972::no title+RAFTERY A+P 4 VAL INT M BAY ST+1992::DEPENDENCE PROPERTIES OF GENERALIZED LIOUVILLE DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE SIMPLEX+RAYENS, WS; SRINIVASAN, C+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1994::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::Semiparametric Bayesian analysis of survival data+Sinha, D; Dey, DK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES FOR CERTAIN GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+WEDDERBURN, RWM+BIOMETRIKA+1976::no title+West, M.+Bayesian Forecasting &amp; Dynamic Models+1989::no title+Whittaker, E.

The curse of dimensionality induced by our approach is overridden by means of fractal dimension considerations. We give asymptotics for a kernel type nonparametric predictor linking the rates of convergence with the fractal dimension of the functional process.

Moreover, we are able to achieve a high efficiency relatively to the classical Hill estimator, provided we may have access to a larger number of top order statistics than the number needed for optimal estimation through the Hill estimator.","statistical theory of extremes,semi-parametric estimation",,"Caeiro, F@Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, DEIO, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lisbon, CEAUL, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Nova Lisboa, FCT, Dept Matemat, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal::Gomes, MI@Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, DEIO, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lisbon, CEAUL, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Nova Lisboa, FCT, Dept Matemat, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal","Caeiro, F@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade Nova de Lisboa::Gomes, MI@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade de Lisboa@Universidade Nova de Lisboa","Gomes, Ivette@N-4326-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2903-6993::Caeiro, Frederico@G-2205-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8628-7281","Tail index estimation and an exponential regression model+Beirlant, J.; Dierckx, G.; Goegebeur, Y.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Matthys, G</span>.+Extremes+1999::Selecting the optimal sample fraction in univariate extreme value estimation+Drees, H; Kaufmann, E+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+JUL 15 1998::Estimating a tail exponent by modelling departure from a Pareto distribution+Feuerverger, A; Hall, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::no title+Geluk, J.

Conditioning on uncertain event: Extensions to Bayesian inference,TEST,10.1007/BF02595712,DEC 2002,18,2,"In this paper the alternative procedure for updating probabilities (that is, to calculate the posterior distribution from the prior distribution) proposed by Richard Jeffrey is considered, which allows the addition of new information to the prior distribution under more circumstances than with the Bayesian conditioning. A predictivistic approach for the Jeffrey's rule is introduced and a definition of conjugacy according to this rule (named Jeffrey-conjugacy) is established. Results for Jeffrey-conjugacy in the exponential family are also presented. As a by-product, these results provide full predictivistic characterizations of some predictive distributions. By using both the predictivistic Jeffrey's rule and Jeffrey-conjugacy, a forecasting procedure which is applied to the Chilean stock market data is also developed.

Key results are that the estimation procedures used in the study, provide good results in terms of biases in the estimation of the parameters, and that the biases are not changed when contaminated errors (mixtures) are considered.

On the probability of a model,TEST,10.1007/BF02595715,DEC 2002,29,1,"The posterior probabilities of K given models when improper priors are used depend on the proportionality constants assigned to the prior densities corresponding to each of the models. It is shown that this assignment can be done using natural geometric priors in multiple regression problems if the normal distribution of the residual errors is truncated. This truncation is a realistic modification of the regression models, and since it will be made far away from the mean, it has no other effect beyond the determination of the proportionality constants, provided that the sample size is not too large. In the case K = 2, the posterior odds ratio is related to the usual F statistic in ""classical"" statistics. Assuming zero-one losses the optimal selection of a regression model is achieved by maximizing the posterior probability of a submodel. It is shown that the geometric criterion obtained in this way is asymptotically equivalent to Schwarz's asymptotic Bayesian criterion, sometimes called the BIC criterion. An example of polynomial regression is used to provide numerical comparisons between the new geometric criterion, the BIC criterion and the Akaike information criterion.","Bayesian testing,geometric Bayesian inference,geometric priors,model selection,probability of a model,sharp hypotheses,variable selection","SELECTION,CRITERION","Villegas, C@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Swartz, T@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Martinez, C@Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Villegas, C@Simon Fraser University::Swartz, T@Simon Fraser University::Martinez, C@Simon Fraser University",not exist,"no title+AKAIKE H+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::On entropy maximization principle+Akaike, H.+Applications of statistics+1977::A comment on D.

Optimal cluster selection probabilities to estimate the finite population distribution function under PPS cluster sampling,TEST,10.1007/BF02595730,JUN 2002,9,3,"The estimation of the finite population distribution function under several sampling strategies based on a PPS cluster sampling, i.e., with cluster selection probabilities proportional to size, is studied. For the estimation of population means and totals, it is well-known that this type of strategies gives good results if the cluster selection probabilities are proportional to the total of the variable under study or to a related auxiliary variable over the cluster. It is proved that, for the estimation of the distribution function using cluster sampling, this solution is not good in general and, under an appropriate criteria, the optimal cluster selection probabilities that minimize the variance of the estimation, is obtained. This methodology is applied to two classical PPS sampling strategies: sampling with replacement, with the Hansen-Hurwitz estimator, and random groups sampling, with the Rao-Hartley-Cochran estimator. Finally a small simulation to compare the efficiency of this approach with other methods is presented.","finite population distribution function,selection probabilities proportional to size,optimal cluster selection probabilities,random groups",,"Mayor, JA@Univ Sevilla, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Fac Matemat, E-41012 Seville, Spain","Mayor, JA@University of Sevilla","Mayor Gallego, Jose A.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8617-7514","PROPERTIES OF ESTIMATORS OF THE FINITE POPULATION-DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION+CHAMBERS, RL; DORFMAN, AH; HALL, P+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1992::ESTIMATING DISTRIBUTION-FUNCTIONS FROM SURVEY DATA+CHAMBERS, RL; DUNSTAN, R+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1986::On the theory of sampling from finite populations+Hansen, MH; Hurwitz, WN+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1943::ESTIMATION OF DISTRIBUTION-FUNCTIONS AND MEDIANS UNDER SAMPLING WITH UNEQUAL PROBABILITIES+KUK, AYC+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1988::Estimating totals and distribution functions using auxiliary information at the estimation stage+Rao, J.N.K.+Journal of Official Statistics+1994::ON ESTIMATING DISTRIBUTION-FUNCTIONS AND QUANTILES FROM SURVEY DATA USING AUXILIARY INFORMATION+RAO, JNK; KOVAR, JG; MANTEL, HJ+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1990::SIMPLE PROCEDURE OF UNEQUAL PROBABILITY SAMPLING WITHOUT REPLACEMENT+RAO, JNK; COCHRAN, WG; HARTLEY, HO+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1962::no title+Sarndal,, C.-E.; Swensson, B.; Wretman, J.+Model assisted survey sampling+1992::Bias-calibrated estimation from sample surveys containing outliers+Welsh, AH; Ronchetti, E+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998"
Goodness-of-fit tests for location and scale families based on a weighted L-2-Wasserstein distance measure,TEST,10.1007/BF02595731,JUN 2002,14,11,"In two recent papers del Barrio et at. (1999) and del Barrio et al. (2000) consider a new class of goodness-of-fit statistics based on the L-2-Wasserstein distance. They derive the limiting distribution of these statistics and show that the normal distribution is the only location-scale family for which this limiting distribution has the ""loss of degrees of freedom"" property, due to the estimation of the unknown parameters. In this paper a weighted L-2-Wasserstein distance is considered and it is proven that these statistics retain the loss of degrees of freedom property for general classes of distributions, if applied separately to the location family and to the scale family and if the ""right"" weight function is used. These weight functions are such that the corresponding minimum distance estimators for the location parameter and the scale parameter are asymptotically efficient. Examples are discussed for both location and scale families.","goodiless-of-fit,Wasserstein distance,location family,scale family,quantile process,Brownian bridge,minimum distance estimation,limiting distributions,asymptotic efficiency,Karhunen-Loeve expansion,sum of weighted chisquares,loss of degrees of freedom",,"de Wet, T@Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa","de Wet, T@Stellenbosch University",not exist,"SOME ASYMPTOTIC THEORY FOR THE BOOTSTRAP+BICKEL, PJ; FREEDMAN, DA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::ASYMPTOTIC DISTRIBUTION OF LINEAR COMBINATIONS OF FUNCTIONS OF ORDER STATISTICS WITH APPLICATIONS TO ESTIMATION+CHERNOFF, H; GASTWIRTH, JL; JOHNS, MV+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1967::no title+Csorgo, M.; Horvath, L.+Weighted Approximations in Probability and Statistics+1993::Weighted correlation tests for scale families+Csorgo, S+TEST+JUN 2002::Tests of goodness of fit based on the L-2-Wasserstein distance+Del Barrio, E; Cuesta-Albertos, JA; Matran, C; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 1999::Contributions of empirical and quantile processes to the asymptotic theory of goodness-of-fit tests+del Barrio, E; Cuesta-Albertos, JA; Matran, C+TEST+JUN 2000::Asymptotic distributions for quadratic forms with applications to tests of fit+Dewet, T; Venter, JH.+Annals of Statistics+1973::no title+DEWET T+J MULTIVARIATE ANAL+1980::no title+DEWET T+S AFRICAN STAT J+1973::ASYMPTOTIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF QUADRATIC FUNCTIONALS OF PARTIAL SUMS+DEWET, T; VENTER, JH+SOUTH AFRICAN STATISTICAL JOURNAL+1976::EFFICIENCY AND OPTIMALITY OF QUADRATIC TESTS+GREGORY, GG+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1980::LARGE SAMPLE THEORY FOR U-STATISTICS AND TESTS OF FIT+GREGORY, GG+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1977::no title+Grenander, U.+Abstract Inference+1981::Asymptotic distributions of certain test criteria of normality+Venter, J.

Product-limit estimation for length-biased censored data,TEST,10.1007/BF02595732,JUN 2002,24,12,"Length-biased and censored data may appear when analyzing times of duration. In this work, a new empirical curve F for approximating a distribution function F tinder right-censoring and length-bias is introduced. The proposed estimate is (not equal to but) closely related to the product-limit Kaplan-Meier estimator. Strong consistency and distributional convergence is established for a general empirical parameter (gamma) over tilde = g(integral phi(1)d (F) over tilde, ..., integral phi(r)d (F) over tilde). As applications, one can obtain the corresponding large sample results for estimates of the distribution function, the cumulative hazard function, and the mean residual time function.

A biplot method for multivariate normal populations with unequal covariance matrices,TEST,10.1007/BF02595734,JUN 2002,14,4,"Some previous ideas about non-linear biplots to achieve a joint representation of multivariate normal populations and any parametric function without assumptions about the covariance matrices are extended. Usual restrictions oil the covariance matrices (such as homogeneity) are avoided. Variables are represented as curves corresponding to the directions of maximum means variation. To demonstrate the versatility of the method, the representation of variances and covariances as an example of further possible interesting parametric functions have been developed. This method is illustrated with two different data sets, and these results are compared with those obtained using two other distances for the normal multivariate case: the Mahalanobis distance (assuming a common covariance matrix for all populations) and Rao's distance, assuming a common eigenvector structure for all the covariance matrices.","multivariate normal distribution,nonlinear biplots,Siegel distance,Rao distance",DISTANCE,"Calvo, M@Univ Barcelona, Dept Estadist, Barcelona 08028, Spain::Villarroya, A@Univ Barcelona, Dept Estadist, Barcelona 08028, Spain::Oller, JM@Univ Barcelona, Dept Estadist, Barcelona 08028, Spain","Calvo, M@University of Barcelona::Villarroya, A@University of Barcelona::Oller, JM@University of Barcelona","Oller, JM@G-4284-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9643-4406::Calvo LLorca, Miguel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4016-3336","AN APPLICATION OF COMMON PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS TO CRANIAL MORPHOMETRY OF MICROTUS-CALIFORNICUS AND MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER (MAMMALIA, RODENTIA)+AIROLDI, JP; FLURY, BK+JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY+SEP 1988::Age variation in volves (Microtus californicus, M. ochrogaster) and its significance for systematic studies+Airoldi, JP; Hoffmann, RS.+Occasional papers of the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, Lawrence KS+1984::Informative geometry of probability spaces+Burbea, J.+Expo Math.+1986::no title+CALVO M+ADV DATA SCI CLASSIF+1998::A DISTANCE BETWEEN MULTIVARIATE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS BASED IN AN EMBEDDING INTO THE SIEGEL GROUP+CALVO, M; OLLER, JM+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+NOV 1990::An Explicit Solution of Information Geodesic Equations for the Multivariate Normal Model+Calvo, M.; Oller, J.M.+Stat.

Incentive contracts and strictly proper scoring rules,TEST,10.1007/BF02595735,JUN 2002,30,8,"When a, decision maker (DM) contracts with all expert to provide information, the nature of the contract call create incentives for the expert, and it is lip to the DM to ensure that the contract provides incentives that align the expert's and DM's interests. In this paper, scoring rules (and related functions) are viewed as such contracts and are reinterpreted in terms of agency theory and the theory of revelation games from economics. Although scoring rules have typically been discussed in the literature as devices for eliciting and evaluating subjective probabilities, this study relies on the fact that strictly proper scoring rules reward greater expertise as well as honest revelation. We describe conditions under which a DM call use a strictly proper scoring rule as a contract to give all expert all incentive to gather all amount of information that is optimal from the DM's perspective. The conditions we consider focus oil the expert's cost structure, and we find that the DM must have substantial knowledge of that cost structure in order to design a specific contract that provides the correct incentives. The model and analysis suggest arguments for hiring and maintaining experts in-house rather than using outside consultants.","scoring rules,agency theory,revelation games,incentives,expert information","PROBABILITY,ELICITATION,AGENCY","Clemen, RT@Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Clemen, RT@Duke University",not exist,"no title+CERVERA JL+TEST+1996::LIMITS FOR THE PRECISION AND VALUE OF INFORMATION FROM DEPENDENT SOURCES+CLEMEN, RT; WINKLER, RL+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+1985::DELEGATED INFORMATION GATHERING DECISIONS+CONROY, RM; HUGHES, JS+ACCOUNTING REVIEW+JAN 1987::no title+Cooke, R.+Experts in Uncertainty: Opinion and Subjective Probability in Science+1991::Assessing probability assessors: Calibration and refinements+DeGroot, M.

In this paper, we consider the Bayes estimates in a single factor quadratic response function, after a reparametrization from the linear model, using noninformative priors. The usual constant noninformative prior for the reparametrized model does not yield a proper posterior, thus it is desirable to consider other noninformative priors such as the Jeffreys prior and reference priors.

On the Bayesianity of Pereira-Stern tests,TEST,10.1007/BF02595698,DEC 2001,11,42,C. Pereira and J.

The related procedure is seen to be a Bayes test for specific loss functions. The nature of such loss functions and their relation to stylised inference problems are investigated.

Asymptotic properties in partial linear models under dependence,TEST,10.1007/BF02595701,DEC 2001,36,7,"Consider the regression model y(i) = zeta(i)(T) beta + m(t(i)) + epsilon(i) for i = 1,...,n. Here (zeta(i)(T), t(i))(T) is an element of R-p x [0, 1] are design points, beta is an unknown p x 1 vector of parameters, m is an unknown smooth function from [0, 1] to R and epsilon(i) are the unobserved errors. We will assume that these errors are not independent. Under suitable assumptions, we obtain expansions for the bias and the variance of a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) type regression estimator, and for an estimator of the nonparametric function m((.)). Furthermore, we prove the asymptotic normality of the first estimator. The obtained results axe a generalization of those contained in Speckman (1988), who studied a similar model with i.i.d. error variables.","bandwidth selection,kernel smoothing,mixing,partial linear models","KERNEL REGRESSION,TIME-SERIES,CONVERGENCE,ERRORS","Aneiros, G@Univ A Coruna, Fac Informat, Dept Matemat, La Coruna, Spain::Quintela, A@Univ A Coruna, Fac Informat, Dept Matemat, La Coruna, Spain","Aneiros, G@Universidade da Coruna::Quintela, A@Universidade da Coruna","Quintela-del-Rio, Alejandro@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8604-3340","no title+Brockwell, PJ; Davis, RA.+TIME SERIES THEORY M+1991::no title+DANIEL C+FITTING EQUATIONS DA+1980::CONVERGENCE OF DISTRIBUTIONS GENERATED BY STATIONARY STOCHASTIC PROCESSES+DAVYDOV, YA+THEORY OF PROBILITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS,USSR+1968::Comparison of bandwidth selectors in nonparametric regression under dependence+delRio, AQ+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 1996::no title+DENBY L+26 ATT BELL LAB+1986::no title+Doukhan, P.+LECT NOTES STAT+1994::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATES OF THE RELATION BETWEEN WEATHER AND ELECTRICITY SALES+ENGLE, RF; GRANGER, CWJ; RICE, J; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1986::no title+Fan, J.; Gijbels, I.+Local polynomial modeling and its applications+1996::TRANSFORMATIONS FOR ESTIMATION OF LINEAR MODELS WITH NESTED-ERROR STRUCTURE+FULLER, WA; BATTESE, GE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1973::ASYMPTOTIC THEORY FOR PARTLY LINEAR-MODELS+GAO, JT+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::PREDICTING USING BOX-JENKINS, NONPARAMETRIC, AND BOOTSTRAP TECHNIQUES+GARCIAJURADO, I; GONZALEZMANTEIGA, W; PRADASANCHEZ, JM; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1995::KERNELS FOR NONPARAMETRIC CURVE ESTIMATION+GASSER, T; MULLER, HG; MAMMITZSCH, V+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1985::ESTIMATING REGRESSION-FUNCTIONS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES BY THE KERNEL-METHOD+GASSER, T; MULLER, HG+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1984::ANALYSIS OF FIELD EXPERIMENTS BY LEAST-SQUARES SMOOTHING+GREEN, P; JENNISON, C; SEHEULT, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1985::Nonparametric Curve Estimation from Time Series+Gyorfi, L.; Hardle, W.; Sarda, P.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Vieu, P</span>.+LECT NOTES STAT+1990::no title+Hardle, W.+Applied Nonparametric Regression+1993::KERNEL REGRESSION ESTIMATION WITH TIME-SERIES ERRORS+HART, JD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::SPLINE SMOOTHING IN A PARTLY LINEAR-MODEL+HECKMAN, NE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1986::CHOICE OF BANDWIDTH FOR KERNEL REGRESSION WHEN RESIDUALS ARE CORRELATED+HERRMANN, E; GASSER, T; KNEIP, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1992::no title+Judge, GG; Griffiths, WE; Hill, RC<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lutkepohl, H; Lee, TC</span>.+The theory and practice of econometrics+1985::MIXING PROPERTIES OF ARMA PROCESSES+MOKKADEM, A+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+SEP 1988::Kernel estimation of regression functions+Muller, HG; Gasser, T.+LECT NOTES MATH+1979::REMARKS ON NON-PARAMETRIC ESTIMATES FOR DENSITY FUNCTIONS AND REGRESSION CURVES+NADARAYA, EA+THEORY OF PROBILITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS,USSR+1970::NONPARAMETRIC FUNCTION FITTING+PRIESTLEY, MB; CHAO, MT+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::CONVERGENCE-RATES FOR PARTIALLY SPLINED MODELS+RICE, J+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 1986::FIXED DESIGN REGRESSION FOR TIME-SERIES - ASYMPTOTIC NORMALITY+ROUSSAS, GG; TRAN, LT; IOANNIDES, DA+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+FEB 1992::no title+SCHICK A+ASYMPTOTICS NONPARAM+1999::no title+SCHICK A+J TIME SER ANAL+1998::Efficient estimation in a semiparametric additive regression model with autoregressive errors+Schick, A+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+FEB 1996::no title+Simonoff, J.

To overcome such difficulties, borrowing strength from related small areas via modeling becomes an appropriate approach.

Parametric modelling of growth curve data: An overview,TEST,10.1007/BF02595823,JUN 2001,51,114,"In the past two decades a parametric multivariate regression modelling approach for analyzing growth curve data has achieved prominence. The approach, which has several advantages over classical analysis-of-variance and general multivariate approaches, consists of postulating, fitting, evaluating, and comparing parametric models for the data's mean structure and covariance structure. This article provides an overview of the approach, using unified terminology and notation. Well established models and some developed more recently are described, with emphasis given to those models that allow for nonstationarity and for measurement times that differ across subjects and are unequally spaced. Graphical diagnostics that can assist with model postulation and evaluation are discussed, as are more formal methods for fitting and comparing models. Three examples serve to illustrate the methodology and to reveal the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various parametric models.","AIC,BIC,covariance structure,longitudinal data,mean structure,repeated measures,RLRT","LONGITUDINAL DATA,NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION,COVARIANCE STRUCTURE,CORRELATED ERRORS,REGRESSION,INFERENCE","Zimmerman, DL@Univ Basque Country, Dept Econ & Estadist, EA 3, Bilbao 48015, Spain@Univ Iowa, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Nunez-Anton, V@Univ Basque Country, Dept Econ & Estadist, EA 3, Bilbao 48015, Spain@Univ Iowa, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Zimmerman, DL@University of Basque Country@University of Iowa::Nunez-Anton, V@University of Basque Country@University of Iowa","Nunez-Anton, Vicente@H-6953-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4395-0941","NONPARAMETRIC EMPIRICAL BAYES GROWTH CURVE ANALYSIS+ALTMAN, NS;

Reference Bayesian methods for recapture models with heterogeneity,TEST,10.1007/s11749-009-0147-9,MAY 2010,37,10,"In the context of capture-recapture experiments heterogeneous capture probabilities are often perceived as one of the most challenging features to be incorporated in statistical models. In this paper we propose within a Bayesian framework a new modeling strategy for inference on the unknown population size in the presence of heterogeneity of subject characteristics. Our approach is attractive in that parameters are easily interpretable. Moreover, no parametric distributional assumptions are imposed on the latent distribution of individual heterogeneous propensities to be captured. Bayesian inference based on marginal likelihood by-passes some common identifiability issues, and a formal default prior distribution can be derived. Alternative default prior choices are considered and compared. Performance of our formal default approach is favorably evaluated with two real data sets and with a small simulation study.","Capture-recapture models,Heterogeneity,Bayesian inference,Population size,Default prior,Model choice","CAPTURE-RECAPTURE,MOMENT SEQUENCES,DISTRIBUTIONS,POPULATION,INFERENCE,PRIORS,SIZE","Farcomeni, Alessio@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy::Tardella, Luca@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy","Farcomeni, Alessio@Sapienza University Rome::Tardella, Luca@Sapienza University Rome","Farcomeni, Alessio@K-8719-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7104-5826::TARDELLA, Luca@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5703-3909","ORDERED GROUP REFERENCE PRIORS WITH APPLICATION TO THE MULTINOMIAL PROBLEM+BERGER, JO; BERNARDO, JM+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1992::no title+Bernardo, J.

We determine the sets of functions that are well estimated at the rates (log n/n) (beta/(2 beta+d)) and n (-beta/(2 beta+d)) by kernel estimators. These sets are called maxisets. Then, we characterize the maxisets associated to kernel estimators and to the Lepski procedure for the rate of convergence (log n/n) (beta/(2 beta+d)) in terms of Besov and Holder spaces of regularity beta. Using maxiset results, optimal choices for the bandwidth parameter of kernel rules are derived.

We obtain maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters using EM algorithm. We also compute the expected Fisher information matrix using the missing value principle.

Two nested families of skew-symmetric circular distributions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0111-0,NOV 2009,17,3,"In this paper, we introduce two new flexible families of unimodal circular distributions obtained by wrapping onto the unit circle two recently explored heavy-tailed distributions defined on the real line. The first, the four-parameter wrapped normal-Laplace distribution, is nested within the second, the five-parameter wrapped generalized normal-Laplace distribution. Both families contain the wrapped normal and wrapped Laplace and generalized Laplace distributions as special cases. Stochastic models for the genesis of these new distributions, which may be useful in identifying situations in which they are likely to occur, are developed. The basic properties of the new distributions are derived and model fitting by maximum likelihood discussed.

The proposed beta ARMA model includes both autoregressive and moving average dynamics, and also includes a set of regressors. We discuss parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, goodness-of-fit assessment and forecasting.

Asymptotic distributions for weighted estimators of the offspring mean in a branching process,TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0124-8,NOV 2009,17,6,"It is known that conditional least squares estimator (CLSE) of the offspring mean for the process with a stationary immigration is not asymptotically normal. In the paper, we demonstrate that for the process with non-stationary immigration it may have a normal limit distribution. Considering a discrete time branching process Z(n) with time-dependent immigration, whose mean and variance vary regularly with nonnegative exponents alpha and beta, respectively, we show that 1+2 alpha is the threshold for asymptotic normality of the estimator. It will be proved that if beta < 1+2 alpha, the estimator is asymptotically normal with two different normalizing factors, and if beta > 1+2 alpha its limiting distribution is not normal, but can be expressed in terms of certain functionals of the time-changed Wiener process. When beta=1+2 alpha, the limiting distribution depends on the behavior of the slowly varying parts of the mean and variance. We derive all possible limit distributions of the weighted CLSE based on observations {Z(r+1),Z(r+2),aEuro broken vertical bar,Z(n)} as n -> a and r=[n epsilon], 0a parts per thousand currency sign epsilon < 1. Conditions guaranteeing the strong consistency of the proposed estimator will be derived.","Branching process,Time-dependent immigration,Skorokhod space,Offspring mean,Weighted estimator,Consistency","MULTIPLICATIVE PROCESS,IMMIGRATION RATES,INFERENCE,GROWTH,LIMIT","Rahimov, I.@KFUPM, Dept Math & Stat, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia","Rahimov, I.@King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals",not exist,"Asymptotic inference for spatial autoregression and orthogonality of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck sheets+Arato, M; Pap, G; van Zuijlen, MCA+COMPUTERS &amp; MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS+JUL 2001::no title+Bingham, N.

Return level bounds for discrete and continuous random variables,TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0125-7,NOV 2009,26,3,"For a wide range of applications in hydrology and climate studies, the return level is a fundamental quantity to build dykes, propose flood planning policies, and study weather and climate phenomena linked to the behavior of the upper tail of a distribution. More precisely, z (t) is called the return level associated with a given return period t if the level z (t) is expected to be exceeded on average once every t years. To estimate this level in the independent and identically distributed setting, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) has been classically used by assuming that exceedances above a high threshold approximately follow a Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). This approximation is based on an asymptotic argument, but the rate of convergence may be slow in some cases, e.g., Gaussian variables, and the choice of an appropriate threshold difficult. As an alternative, we propose and study simple estimators of lower and upper return level bounds. This approach has several advantages. It works for both small and moderate sample sizes and for discrete and continuous random variables. In addition, no threshold selection procedure is needed. Still, there is a clear link with EVT because our bounds can be viewed as extensions of the concept of the probability weighted moments that has been classically used in hydrology. In particular, some moment conditions have to be satisfied in order to derive the asymptotic properties of our estimators. We apply our methodology to a few simulations and two climate data sets.","Discrete extremes,Empirical processes,Generalized Pareto distribution,Return level","PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED MOMENTS,EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION,ITERATED LOGARITHM,QUANTILE PROCESSES,LIMIT-THEOREMS,BERRY-ESSEEN,STATISTICS","Guillou, A.@Univ Strasbourg, IRMA, F-67084 Strasbourg, France::Naveau, P.@CNRS, IPSL, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France::Diebolt, J.@Univ Marne La Vallee, Equipe Anal & Math Appl, CNRS, F-77454 Marne La Vallee 2, France::Ribereau, P.@Univ Montpellier, Equipe Probabilites & Stat, CC 051, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France","Guillou, A.@Universite de Strasbourg@Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes::Naveau, P.@Universite Paris Saclay (ComUE)@CEA@Universite de Versailles Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Diebolt, J.@Universite Paris-Est (ComUE)@Universite Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallee@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Ribereau, P.@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)@Universite de Montpellier",not exist,"no title+BONNIN, G.; TODD, D.; PARZYBOK, T.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; YEKTA, M.; RILEY, D.; LIN, B</span>.+NOAA ATLAS 14 PRECIP+2004::no title+BONNIN, G.; TODD, D.; PARZYBOK, T.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; YEKTA, M.; RILEY, D.; LIN, B</span>.+NOAA ATLAS 14 PRECIP+2004::An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values+Coles, S.+SPRINGER SERIES STAT+2001::Likelihood-based inference for extreme value models+Coles, S.

On the low intensity bootstrap for triangular arrays of independent identically distributed random variables,TEST,10.1007/s11749-007-0077-3,AUG 2009,24,1,"In this work, we give a complete picture of the behavior of the low intensity bootstrap of linear statistics. Our setup is given by triangular arrays of independent identically distributed random variables and different normalizations related to the rates of bootstrap intensities. We show that the behavior of this low intensity bootstrap coincides with that of partial sums of a number of summands equal to the bootstrap resampling size. Agreement on the limit laws for different (small) bootstrap sizes is thus shown to be closely related to domains of attraction of alpha-stable laws. As a byproduct, we obtain local distributional properties of L,vy processes.","Bootstrap,Resampling,Low intensity,Infinitely divisible laws,Stable laws,Domains of attraction,Levy processes","LEVY PROCESSES,SAMPLE-SIZE,NORMALITY,STABILITY","del Barrio, Eustasio@Univ Valladolid, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Valladolid, Spain::Janssen, Arnold@Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Math, D-4000 Dusseldorf, Germany::Matran, Carlos@Univ Valladolid, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Valladolid, Spain","del Barrio, Eustasio@Universidad de Valladolid::Janssen, Arnold@Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf::Matran, Carlos@Universidad de Valladolid","del Barrio, Eustasio@L-1019-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3764-5411::Matran, Carlos@J-6916-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8267-3465","no title+Araujo, A; Gine, E.+The Central Limit Theorem for Real and Banach Valued Random Variables+1980::ADDITIONS AND CORRECTION TO THE BOOTSTRAP OF THE MEAN WITH ARBITRARY BOOTSTRAP SAMPLE-SIZE+ARCONES, MA; GINE, E+ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE-PROBABILITES ET STATISTIQUES+1991::THE BOOTSTRAP OF THE MEAN WITH ARBITRARY BOOTSTRAP SAMPLE-SIZE+ARCONES, MA; GINE, E+ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE-PROBABILITES ET STATISTIQUES+1989::BOOTSTRAP OF THE MEAN IN THE INFINITE VARIANCE CASE+ATHREYA, KB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1987::no title+BICKEL P+CHOICE M M OUT N BOO+2005::Resampling fewer than n observations: Gains, losses, and remedies for losses+Bickel, PJ; Gotze, F; vanZwet, WR+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1997::no title+Breiman, L.+Probability+1968::A survey of limit laws for bootstrapped sums+CSORGO, S.; ROSALSKY, A.+International Journal of Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics+2003::The asymptotic distribution of the bootstrap sample mean of an infinitesimal array+Cuesta-Albertos, JA; Matran, C+ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE-PROBABILITES ET STATISTIQUES+JAN-FEB 1998::SOME RESULTS ON THE INFLUENCE OF EXTREMES ON THE BOOTSTRAP+DEHEUVELS, P; MASON, DM; SHORACK, GR+ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE-PROBABILITES ET STATISTIQUES+1993::Necessary conditions for the bootstrap of the mean of a triangular array+del Barrio, E; Matran, C; Cuesta-Albertos, JA+ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE-PROBABILITES ET STATISTIQUES+MAY-JUN 1999::The weighted bootstrap mean for heavy-tailed distributions+del Barrio, E; Matran, C+JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PROBABILITY+APR 2000::Asymptotic stability of the bootstrap sampled mean+del Barrio, E; Cuesta-Albertos, JA; Matran, C+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+FEB 2002::no title+DELBARRIO E+RESAMPLING SCH UNPUB+2007::Stability and attraction to normality for Levy processes at zero and at infinity+Doney, RA; Maller, RA+JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PROBABILITY+JUL 2002::How do bootstrap and permutation tests work?+Janssen, A; Pauls, T+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2003::Resampling student's t-type statistics+Janssen, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 2005::BOOTSTRAP, WILD BOOTSTRAP, AND ASYMPTOTIC NORMALITY+MAMMEN, E+PROBABILITY THEORY AND RELATED FIELDS+OCT 1992::When Does the Bootstrap Work?

Benchmarked estimates in small areas using linear mixed models with restrictions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0094-x,AUG 2009,26,14,"Linear mixed models have been frequently used to provide estimates in small areas. However, when aggregating small areas within the same region, the sum of these small area estimates does not generally match up with the estimate obtained using an appropriate estimator for the larger region. Then, benchmarking the model-dependent estimates to the ones obtained at certain level of aggregation is needed. In this paper, we propose a small area estimator based on a linear mixed effects model with restrictions to guarantee the concordance between the aggregations of small area estimates and those reported by statistical agencies for larger domains using a synthetic estimator. The mean squared prediction error of the restricted estimator is also derived and its performance is evaluated through a simulation study. The procedure is applied to the 2002 Business Survey of the Basque Country, Spain.","Bootstrap,Finite population,Prediction theory","STATE-SPACE MODELS,TIME-SERIES,PREDICTION,BOOTSTRAP,ERROR","Ugarte, M.

Pseudo maximum likelihood estimates using ranked set sampling with applications to estimating correlation,TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0096-8,AUG 2009,14,0,"Suppose theta is the parameter of interest and lambda is the nuisance parameter. When obtaining the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of theta in the presence of lambda requires intensive computation, the pseudo MLE of theta, based on a pseudo likelihood function, can be used. Gong and Samaniego (Ann. Stat. 9:861-869, 1981) proposed a pseudo MLE (PMLE) based on simple random samples. Ranked set sampling has been applied to the bivariate variables (X,Y) where measuring one of the variables is difficult or costly. In this paper, we obtain the pseudo MLE of the correlation coefficient from a bivariate normal distribution (X,Y) based on ranked set samples, assuming that Y is difficult or more expensive to measure and that the mean and variance of Y are the nuisance parameters. The PMLE is compared with three other estimators of the correlation coefficient. Simulations show that the PMLE is more (less) efficient than other estimators, depending on value of rho. Testing of soil contamination provides an example of the use of the methods.","Ranked set sampling,Concomitant variable,Bivariate normal distribution,Pseudo maximum likelihood estimator","CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT,REGRESSION","Hui, Terrence P.@Unknow::Modarres, Reza@George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA::Zheng, Gang@NHLBI, Off Biostat Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Hui, Terrence P.@Unknow::Modarres, Reza@George Washington University::Zheng, Gang@National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA@NIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)",not exist,"CONCOMITANTS AND CORRELATION ESTIMATES+BARNETT, V; GREEN, PJ; ROBINSON, A+BIOMETRIKA+1976::RANKED SET SAMPLING THEORY WITH ORDER STATISTICS BACKGROUND+DELL, TR; CLUTTER, JL+BIOMETRICS+1972::no title+GILBERT RO+HEALTH PHYS+1988::PSEUDO MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION - THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+GONG, G; SAMANIEGO, FJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::Bootstrap confidence interval estimation of mean via ranked set sampling linear regression+Hui, TP; Modarres, R; Zheng, G+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+JUL 2005::no title+HUI TP+THESIS G WASHINGTON+2005::no title+Johnson, N.L.; Kotz, S.+Continuous Multivariate Distributions+1972::A METHOD FOR UNBIASED SELECTIVE SAMPLING, USING RANKED SETS+MCINTYRE, GA+AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH+1952::PSEUDO MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION - THE ASYMPTOTIC-DISTRIBUTION+PARKE, WR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1986::Editorial: ranked set sampling+Patil, G.

RESET for quantile regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0097-7,AUG 2009,11,2,"This paper proposes a simple specification test for quantile regression models. Our test is based on Ramsey's (J. R. Stat. Soc. B 31:350-371, 1969) RESET (regression specification error test). Comparing to existing nonparametric specification tests, the proposed test does not contain kernel functions and bandwidth parameters and is easy to implement. Although the proposed test is not necessarily consistent against all types of misspecification, simulation results indicate that our test has reasonable size and power properties and can be more powerful than nonparametric specification tests in small samples.","Quantile regression,RESET",TESTS,"Otsu, Taisuke@Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Otsu, Taisuke@Yale University",not exist,"Quantile regression under misspecification, with an application to the US wage structure+Angrist, J; Chernozhukov, V; Fernandez-Val, I+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2006::Bierens and Donna K.

Semi-parametric second-order reduced-bias high quantile estimation,TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0108-8,AUG 2009,29,5,"In many areas of application, like, for instance, Climatology, Hydrology, Insurance, Finance, and Statistical Quality Control, a typical requirement is to estimate a high quantile of probability 1-p, a value high enough so that the chance of an exceedance of that value is equal to p, small. The semi-parametric estimation of high quantiles depends not only on the estimation of the tail index or extreme value index gamma, the primary parameter of extreme events, but also on the adequate estimation of a scale first order parameter. Recently, apart from new classes of reduced-bias estimators for gamma > 0, new classes of the scale first order parameter have been introduced in the literature. Their use in quantile estimation enables us to introduce new classes of asymptotically unbiased high quantiles' estimators, with the same asymptotic variance as the (biased) ""classical"" estimator. The asymptotic distributional properties of the proposed classes of estimators are derived and the estimators are compared with alternative ones, not only asymptotically, but also for finite samples through Monte Carlo techniques. An application to the log-exchange rates of the Euro against the Sterling Pound is also provided.","Heavy tails,High quantiles,Semi-parametric estimation,Statistics of extremes","EXTREME-VALUE INDEX,TAIL INDEX,REDUCTION,EXPONENT","Caeiro, Frederico@Univ Nova Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal@CMA, Lisbon, Portugal::Gomes, M.

Missing data methods in longitudinal studies: a review,TEST,10.1007/s11749-009-0138-x,MAY 2009,101,105,"Incomplete data are quite common in biomedical and other types of research, especially in longitudinal studies. During the last three decades, a vast amount of work has been done in the area. This has led, on the one hand, to a rich taxonomy of missing-data concepts, issues, and methods and, on the other hand, to a variety of data-analytic tools. Elements of taxonomy include: missing data patterns, mechanisms, and modeling frameworks; inferential paradigms; and sensitivity analysis frameworks. These are described in detail. A variety of concrete modeling devices is presented. To make matters concrete, two case studies are considered. The first one concerns quality of life among breast cancer patients, while the second one examines data from the Muscatine children's obesity study.","Expectation-maximization algorithm,Incomplete data,Missing completely at random,Missing at random,Missing not at random,Pattern-mixture model,Selection model,Sensitivity analyses,Shared-parameter model","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,PATTERN-MIXTURE-MODELS,CURE RATE MODELS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,CANCER VACCINE TRIALS,COX REGRESSION-MODEL,DEPENDENT FOLLOW-UP,SURVIVAL-DATA,EM ALGORITHM,INCOMPLETE-DATA","Ibrahim, Joseph G.@Univ N Carolina, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA::Molenberghs, Geert@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Int Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium","Ibrahim, Joseph G.@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina::Molenberghs, Geert@KU Leuven@Hasselt University",not exist,"DIAGNOSTICS FOR MIXED-MODEL ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE+BECKMAN, RJ; NACHTSHEIM, CJ; COOK, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::Bayesian analysis of realistically complex models+Best, NG; Spiegelhalter, DJ; Thomas, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1996::A latent-class mixture model for incomplete longitudinal Gaussian data+Beunckens, Caroline; Molenberghs, Geert; Verbeke, Geert; et al.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2008::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::A flexible B-spline model for multiple longitudinal biomarkers and survival+Brown, ER; Ibrahim, JG; DeGruttola, V+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2005::Bayesian approaches to joint cure-rate and longitudinal models with applications to cancer vaccine trials+Brown, ER; Ibrahim, JG+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2003::A Bayesian semiparametric joint hierarchical model for longitudinal and survival data+Brown, ER; Ibrahim, JG+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2003::Coping with missing data in clinical trials: A model-based approach applied to asthma trials+Carpenter, J; Pocock, S; Lamm, CJ+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 2002::Maximum likelihood methods for cure rate models with missing covariates+Chen, MH; Ibrahim, JG+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2001::no title+CHEN MH+J MULTIVAR IN PRESS+2009::A new joint model for longitudinal and survival data with a cure fraction+Chen, MH; Ibrahim, JG; Sinha, D+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 2004::Propriety of the posterior distribution and existence of the MLE for regression models with covariates missing at random+Chen, MH; Ibrahim, JG; Shao, QM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2004::Bayesian methods for missing covariates in cure rate models+Chen, MH; Ibrahim, JG; Lipsitz, SR+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 2002::Posterior propriety and computation for the Cox regression model with applications to missing covariates+Chen, Ming-Hui; Ibrahim, Joseph G.; Shao, Qi-Man+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2006::Theory and inference for regression models with missing responses and covariates+Chen, Qingxia; Ibrahim, Joseph G.; Chen, Ming-Hui; et al.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 2008::Sieve maximum likelihood estimation for regression models with covariates missing at random+Chen, Qingxia; Zeng, Donglin; Ibrahim, Joseph G.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2007::Semiparametric models for missing covariate and response data in regression models+Chen, QX; Ibrahim, JG+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2006::Bayesian approaches to joint longitudinal and survival models accommodating both zero and nonzero cure fractions+Chi, Yueh-Yun; Ibrahim, Joseph G.+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2007::Joint models for multivariate longitudinal and multivariate survival data+Chi, YY; Ibrahim, JG+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2006::ASSESSMENT OF LOCAL INFLUENCE+COOK, RD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1986::Bayesian Tobit modeling of longitudinal ordinal clinical trial compliance data with nonignorable missingness+Cowles, MK; Carlin, BP; Connett, JE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::no title+CREEMERS A+SHARED PARAMET UNPUB+2009::Description of Motivating Examples+Daniels, Michael J.; Hogan, Joseph W.+MISSING DATA IN LONGITUDINAL STUDIES: STRATEGIES FOR BAYESIAN MODELING AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS+2008::MODELING PROGRESSION OF CD4-LYMPHOCYTE COUNT AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO SURVIVAL-TIME+DEGRUTTOLA, V; TU, XM+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1994::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+DIGGLE P+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1994::no title+Diggle, P.

In this case, the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimators (UMVUEs) of the mean life and the failure rate at a design stress are derived. It is shown that the UMVUEs have smaller mean squared errors than the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs). A numerical example is used to illustrate the superiority of UMVUEs to MLEs. The optimum test plans of the models are also discussed based on the variance of UMVUEs. Furthermore, we discuss the generalization of the optimal plan to more than two levels of stress.","Maximum likelihood estimator,Optimum test plan,Progressive type-II censoring,Step-stress accelerated life test,Uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator","ACCELERATED LIFE TESTS,FAILURE RATE MODEL","Wang, Bing Xing@Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Dept Stat, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China::Yu, Keming@Brunel Univ, Dept Math Sci, Brunel, England","Wang, Bing Xing@Zhejiang Gongshang University::Yu, Keming@Brunel University",not exist,"Aroma volatile constituents of Brazilian varieties of mango fruit+Andrade, Eloisa Helena A.; Maia, Jose Guilherme S.; Zoghbi, Maria das Gracas B.+Journal of Food Composition and Analysis+Feb., 2000::Parametric inference for step-stress models+Bagdonavicius, VB; Gerville-Reache, L; Nikulin, MS+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+MAR 2002::Optimum simple step-stress accelerated life tests with censoring+Bai, D.

Control of the false discovery rate under dependence using the bootstrap and subsampling,TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0126-6,NOV 2008,41,39,"This paper considers the problem of testing s null hypotheses simultaneously while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Benjamini and Hochberg (J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 57(1):289-300, 1995) provide a method for controlling the FDR based on p-values for each of the null hypotheses under the assumption that the p-values are independent. Subsequent research has since shown that this procedure is valid under weaker assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values. Related procedures that are valid under no assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values have also been developed. None of these procedures, however, incorporate information about the dependence structure of the test statistics. This paper develops methods for control of the FDR under weak assumptions that incorporate such information and, by doing so, are better able to detect false null hypotheses. We illustrate this property via a simulation study and two empirical applications. In particular, the bootstrap method is competitive with methods that require independence if independence holds, but it outperforms these methods under dependence.","Bootstrap,Subsampling,False discovery rate,Multiple testing,Stepdown procedure","MULTIPLE TEST PROCEDURES,GENERALIZED ERROR RATES,STATISTICS","Romano, Joseph P.@Stanford Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA::Shaikh, Azeem M.@Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA::Wolf, Michael@Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland","Romano, Joseph P.@Stanford University::Shaikh, Azeem M.@University of Chicago::Wolf, Michael@University of Zurich",not exist,"Adaptive thresholding of wavelet coefficients+Abramovich, F; Benjamini, Y+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 10 1996::Adapting to unknown sparsity by controlling the false discovery rate+Abramovich, Felix; Benjamini, Yoav; Donoho, David L.; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2006::AN IMPROVED HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATOR+ANDREWS, DWK; MONAHAN, JC+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1992::Graphical profiles as an aid to understanding plant breeding experiments+Basford, KE; Tukey, JW+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JAN 15 1997::The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency+Benjamini, Y; Yekutieli, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2001::On the adaptive control of the false discovery fate in multiple testing with independent statistics+Benjamini, Y; Hochberg, Y+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SPR 2000::A step-down multiple hypotheses testing procedure that controls the false discovery rate under independence+Benjamini, Y; Liu, W+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 1 1999::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Adaptive linear step-up procedures that control the false discovery rate+Benjamini, Yoav; Krieger, Abba M.; Yekutieli, Daniel+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2006::no title+Davison, AC; Hinkley, DV.+Bootstrap Methods and Their Applications+1997::False discoveries in genome scanning+Drigalenko, EI; Elston, RC+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+1997::no title+Efron, B; Tibshirani, RJ.+An introduction to the bootstrap+1993::1977 RIETZ LECTURE - BOOTSTRAP METHODS - ANOTHER LOOK AT THE JACKKNIFE+EFRON, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::A stochastic process approach to false discovery control+Genovese, C; Wasserman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::Second-order correctness of the blockwise bootstrap for stationary observations+Gotze, F; Kunsch, HR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 1996::Controlled Uncertainty,+Hommel, G.; Hoffmann, T.+Multiple Hypothesenprufung/Multiple Hypotheses Testing+1988::no title+JOE H+J MULTIVARIATE ANAL+2006::no title+KAT HM+0015 AIRC CIT U CASS+2003::no title+Lahiri,, S.+Resampling Methods for Dependent Data+2003::Edgeworth correction by moving block bootstrap for stationary and nonstationary data+Lahiri, S.

Comparison of Bayesian objective procedures for variable selection in linear regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0039-1,NOV 2008,29,16,"In the objective Bayesian approach to variable selection in regression a crucial point is the encompassing of the underlying nonnested linear models. Once the models have been encompassed, one can define objective priors for the multiple testing problem involved in the variable selection problem.

There are two natural ways of encompassing: one way is to encompass all models into the model containing all possible regressors, and the other is to encompass the model containing only the intercept into any other.

In this paper we compare the variable selection procedures that result from each of the two mentioned ways of encompassing by analysing their theoretical properties and their behavior with simulated and real data.

Integral equation solutions as prior distributions for Bayesian model selection,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0040-8,NOV 2008,13,6,"In many statistical problems we deal with more than one model. When the prior information on the parameters of the models is vague default priors are typically used. Unfortunately, these priors are usually improper provoking a calibration problem which precludes the comparison of the models. An attempt for solving this difficulty consists in using intrinsic priors, introduced in Berger and Pericchi (1996, The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction. J Am Stat Assoc 91:109-122), instead of the original default priors; however, there are situations where the class of intrinsic priors is too large.

Because of this we propose prior distributions for model selection that are solutions of a system of integral equations which is derived to calibrate the initial default priors. Under some assumptions our integral equations yield a unique solution. Some illustrative examples are provided.","Bayes factor,Model selection,Integral equations,Intrinsic priors,Expected posterior priors",,"Cano, J.

It terminates when the CUSUM crosses a boundary function or the number of collected observations reaches a prescribed number. We show that the stopping time is asymptotically normal.

We treat alpha as an unknown parameter, but for theoretical simplicity we also consider the case that alpha is fixed. For estimation of parameters and the standardization of data we use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). We derive the asymptotic covariance function of the characteristic function process with parameters estimated by MLE. The eigenvalues of the covariance function are numerically evaluated and the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is obtained using complex integration. We find that if the sample size is large the calculated asymptotic critical values of test statistics coincide with the simulated finite sample critical values. Finite sample power of the proposed test is examined. We also present a formula of the asymptotic covariance function of the characteristic function process with parameters estimated by an efficient estimator for general distributions.","Stable distributions,Goodness-of-fit tests,Integral equations,Maximum likelihood estimator","CAUCHY DISTRIBUTION,NORMALITY,PARAMETERS","Matsui, Muneya@Keio Univ, Grad Sch Fundamental Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Kouhoku Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522\, Japan::Takemura, Akimichi@Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Tokyo, Japan","Matsui, Muneya@Keio University::Takemura, Akimichi@University of Tokyo",not exist,"ASYMPTOTIC THEORY OF CERTAIN GOODNESS OF FIT CRITERIA BASED ON STOCHASTIC PROCESSES+ANDERSON, TW; DARLING, DA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::TESTING FOR NORMALITY IN ARBITRARY DIMENSION+CSORGO, S+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1986::KERNEL-TRANSFORMED EMPIRICAL PROCESSES+CSORGO, S+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+1983::Consistency of some tests for multivariate normality+Csorgo, S.+Metrika+1989::ASYMPTOTIC NORMALITY OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATE WHEN SAMPLING FROM A STABLE DISTRIBUTION+DUMOUCHEL, WH+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::WEAK CONVERGENCE OF SAMPLE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION WHEN PARAMETERS ARE ESTIMATED+DURBIN, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::no title+Durbin, J.+Distribution theory for tests based on sample distribution function+1973::no title+Feller, W.+An introduction to probability theory and its applications+1971::no title+*FREE SOFTW FDN+GNU SCI LIB REF MAN+2005::Goodness-of-fit tests for the Cauchy distribution based on the empirical characteristic function+Gurtler, N; Henze, N+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+JUN 2000::A new approach to the BHEP tests for multivariate normality+Henze, N; Wagner, T+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 1997::Empirical characteristic function approach to goodness-of-fit tests for the cauchy distribution with parameters estimated by MLE or EISE+Matsui, M; Takemura, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 2005::no title+MATSUI M+CIRJEF384 U TOK+2005::Some improvements in numerical evaluation of symmetric stable density and its derivatives+Matsui, M; Takemura, A+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2006::Consistent tests for symmetric stability with finite mean based on the empirical characteristic function+Meintanis, SG+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1 2005::On weighting the studentized empirical characteristic function for testing normality+Naito, K+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1996::Numerical calculation of stable densities and distribution functions+Nolan, J.+Commun.

By studying the sample paths of these statistics, changes in residual dependence can be detected that might be missed by statistics using only the total sum of cross-products. Also, a test statistic for white noise is proposed. It is shown that the limiting distribution of the test statistic converges weakly to a vector Brownian motion with independent elements under the null hypothesis of no residual autocorrelation. An indication of the circumstances under which the asymptotic results apply in finite-sample situations is obtained through a simulation study. Some considerations are given to the empirical size and power of the test statistic vis-A -vis the Ljung-Box (Biometrika 65:297-303, 1978) portmanteau statistic, and a diagnostic test statistic proposed by PeA +/- a and Rodriguez (J.

A Bayesian approach to relaxing parameter restrictions in multivariate GARCH models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-007-0056-8,NOV 2008,35,5,"We propose a Bayesian prior formulation for a multivariate GARCH model that expands the allowable parameter space, directly enforcing both necessary and sufficient conditions for positive definiteness and covariance stationarity. This extends the standard approach of enforcing unnecessary parameter restrictions. A VECH model specification is proposed allowing both parsimony and parameter interpretability, opposing existing specifications that achieve only one of these. A Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, employing Metropolis-Hastings and delayed rejection, is designed. A simulation study shows favourable estimation and improved coverage of intervals, compared with classical methods. Finally, some US and UK financial stock returns are analysed.","Dynamic covariance,Stationarity,Positive definite,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Stock returns","GENERALIZED ARCH,RETURNS","Hudson, Brent G.@Corp Finance & Credit Control Country Energy, Port Macquarie, NSW 2444, Australia::Gerlach, Richard H.@Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Hudson, Brent G.@Unknow::Gerlach, Richard H.@University of Sydney","Gerlach, Richard@C-3915-2011::Gerlach, Richard@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5656-4556","no title+BABA, Y; ENGLE, R.

"Assessing probabilistic forecasts of multivariate quantities, with an application to ensemble predictions of surface winds",TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0114-x,AUG 2008,77,72,"We discuss methods for the evaluation of probabilistic predictions of vector-valued quantities, that can take the form of a discrete forecast ensemble or a density forecast. In particular, we propose a multivariate version of the univariate verification rank histogram or Talagrand diagram that can be used to check the calibration of ensemble forecasts. In the case of density forecasts, Box's density ordinate transform provides an attractive alternative. The multivariate energy score generalizes the continuous ranked probability score. It addresses both calibration and sharpness, and can be used to compare deterministic forecasts, ensemble forecasts and density forecasts, using a single loss function that is proper.

Generalized orderings of excess lifetimes of renewal processes,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0033-7,AUG 2008,22,2,"Several concepts of generalized orderings and generalized ageing classes have been considered in the literature (see Fagiuoli and Pellerey, 1993, Nav Res Logist 40: 829-842). They have been used in reliability, economics and actuarial sciences. These generalized notions provide a knowledge of the intrinsic structure of the ageing and ordering properties of random variables and have become an important tool in applied probability.

In this paper, we provide new results about generalized orderings of excess lifetimes at different times of a renewal process when the underlying distribution belongs to some generalized ageing class.

Approximations for F-tests which are ratios of sums of squares of independent variables with a model close to the normal,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0036-4,AUG 2008,20,6,"The F(a, b)-distribution is very frequently used in Statistics to compute significance levels when the individual observations follow a normal distribution. In this paper, we obtain good analytic approximations for the p-value and critical value of tests in which the test statistic is a ratio of sums of squares of independent and identically distributed random variables (i. e., F-tests under a normal) when the underlying distribution is close to but different from the normal. The class of distributions for the approximations to be valid is delimited with a ""breakdown condition."" With these approximations, we can study, for example, the robustness of validity of this kind of tests and corroborate the thought that they have robustness of validity if only the second degree of freedom depends on a large n and that they do not have robustness of validity if both degrees of freedom depend on n and are similar.

Modeling maxima of longitudinal contralateral observations,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0037-3,AUG 2008,34,21,"The paper gives the joint distribution of maxima of contralateral observations taken from the same individual at several occasions, when the data are normal with given constraints on the parameters. Different constraints lead to different well-known generalizations of the normal distribution. As an immediate consequence, evaluation of several features of these maxima is greatly simplified. The results of the paper are also useful in modeling other phenomena, such as measures of physical fitness based on the best of two trials. Further applications deal with statistical inference, for example, testing whether an identified treatment is best.","canonical fundamental skew-normal distribution,exchangeability,extended skew-normal distribution,multivariate skew-normal distribution,nonlinear prediction","NORMAL RANDOM-VARIABLES,MULTIVARIATE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION,SKEW-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION,LINEAR FUNCTIONS,DISTRIBUTIONS,BIVARIATE,MINIMUM,TESTS","Loperfido, Nicola@Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Fac Econ, Ist Sci Econ, I-61029 Urbino, PU, Italy","Loperfido, Nicola@University of Urbino","Loperfido, Nicola@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4213-1343","no title+ALDOUS DJ+SPRINGER SERIES STAT+1985::On fundamental skew distributions+Arellano-Valle, RB; Genton, MG+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+SEP 2005::2000a.

A statistical view of iterative methods for linear inverse problems,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0038-2,AUG 2008,16,0,"In this article, we study the problem of recovering the unknown solution of a linear ill-posed problem, via iterative regularization methods, from a statistical point of view. The basic purpose of the paper is to develop adaptive model selection techniques for determining the regularization parameters, i.e., the iteration index. We assume observations are taken over a fixed grid and we consider solutions over a sequence of finite-dimensional subspaces. Based on concentration inequalities techniques, we derive non-asymptotic optimal upper bounds for the mean square error of the proposed estimator.","ill-posed problem,singular value decomposition,iterative regularization methods,model selection,descent methods","L-CURVE,REGULARIZATION PARAMETERS,POSED PROBLEMS,INEQUALITIES,SELECTION,BOUNDS","Fermin, Ana K.@UCV, Fac Ciencias, Escuela Matemat, Caracas 1020A, Venezuela::Ludena, C.@IVIC, Dept Matemat, Caracas, Venezuela","Fermin, Ana K.@University of Central Venezuela::Ludena, C.@Venezuelan Institute Science Research",not exist,"Model selection for regression on a fixed design+Baraud, Y+PROBABILITY THEORY AND RELATED FIELDS+AUG 2000::Minimum contrast estimators on sieves: exponential bounds and rates of convergence+Birge, L; Massart, P+BERNOULLI+SEP 1998::Concentration inequalities for sub-additive functions using the entropy method+Bousquet, O+STOCHASTIC INEQUALITIES AND APPLICATIONS+2003::L-curve curvature bounds via Lanczos bidiiagonalization+Calvetti, D; Hansen, PC; Reichel, L+ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS+2002::Oracle inequalities for inverse problems+Cavalier, L; Golubev, GK; Picard, D; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2002::Cross-validation for parameter selection in inverse estimation problems+Dey, AK; Ruymgaart, FH; Mair, BA+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 1996::no title+EGGER H+F013 SBF RICAM+2005::no title+Engl, H.

Goodness-of-fit tests in parametric regression based on the estimation of the error distribution,TEST,10.1007/s11749-007-0044-z,AUG 2008,29,33,"Consider a heteroscedastic regression model Y = m(X) + s(X) e, where m(X) = E(Y vertical bar X) and sigma(2)(X) = Var(Y vertical bar X) are unknown, and the error e is independent of the covariate X. We propose a new type of test statistic for testing whether the regression curve m(.) belongs to some parametric family of regression functions. The proposed test statistic measures the distance between the empirical distribution function of the parametric and of the nonparametric residuals. The asymptotic theory of the proposed test is developed, and the proposed testing procedure is illustrated by means of a small simulation study and the analysis of a data set.","bootstrap,goodness-of-fit,heteroscedastic regression,model check,nonlinear regression,nonparametric regression,residual distribution","NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,MODEL CHECKS,BOOTSTRAP,REDUCTION","Van Keilegom, Ingrid@Univ Catholique Louvain, Inst Stat, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium::Manteiga, Wenceslao Gonzalez@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Matemat, Dept Estadist, Santiago De Compostela 15706, Spain::Sellero, Cesar Sanchez@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Matemat, Dept Estadist, Santiago De Compostela 15706, Spain","Van Keilegom, Ingrid@Universite Catholique Louvain::Manteiga, Wenceslao Gonzalez@University of Santiago De Compostela::Sellero, Cesar Sanchez@University of Santiago De Compostela","Gonzalez Manteiga, Wenceslao@E-4253-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3555-4623::Sanchez Sellero, Cesar Andres@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0046-0819","Non-parametric estimation of the residual distribution+Akritas, MG; Van Keilegom, I+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2001::Goodness-of-fit test for linear models based on local polynomials+Alcala, JT; Cristobal, JA; Gonzalez-Manteiga, W+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAR 15 1999::INFLUENCE OF PARTICULATE POLLUTION ON THE POSITIONS OF NEUTRAL POINTS IN THE SKY AT SEVILLE (SPAIN)+BELLVER, C+ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT+1987::An empirical likelihood goodness-of-fit test for time series+Chen, SX; Hardle, W; Li, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::Data sharpening methods for bias reduction in nonparametric regression+Choi, E; Hall, P; Rousson, V+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2000::no title+Cleveland, WS.+Visualizing data+1993::A consistent test for the functional form of a regression based on a difference of variance estimators+Dette, H+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1999::Validation of linear regression models+Dette, H; Munk, A+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1998::Testing model assumptions in multivariate linear regression models+Dette, H; Munk, A; Wagner, T+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+2000::Generalized likelihood ratio statistics and Wilks phenomenon+Fan, JQ; Zhang, CM; Zhang, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2001::ON SMOOTHING AND THE BOOTSTRAP+HALL, P; DICICCIO, TJ; ROMANO, JP+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1989::COMPARING NONPARAMETRIC VERSUS PARAMETRIC REGRESSION FITS+HARDLE, W; MAMMEN, E+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1993::no title+Hart, J.

Augmenting the bootstrap to analyze high dimensional genomic data,TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0098-6,MAY 2008,31,6,"The data produced by high-throughput genomic techniques are often high dimensional and undersampled. In these settings, statistical analyses that require the inversion of covariance matrices, such as those pursuing supervised dimension reduction or the assessment of interdependence structures, are problematic. In this article we show how the idea of adding noise to the bootstrap, pioneered by Efron, and Silverman and Young, in the late seventies and eighties, can be used to overcome undersampling and effectively estimate the inverse covariance matrix for data sets in which the number of observations is small relative to the number of variables. We demonstrate the performance of this approach, which we call augmented bootstrap, on simulated data and on data derived from genomic DNA sequences and microarray experiments.","inverse covariance,large-p-small-n,resampling,genomics","SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE,GENE-EXPRESSION,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,X-CHROMOSOME,NETWORKS,REGRESSION,PATTERNS,MODELS","Tyekucheva, Svitlana@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, State Coll, PA USA@Penn State Univ, Ctr Comparat Genom & Bioinformat, State Coll, PA USA::Chiaromonte, Francesca@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, State Coll, PA USA@Penn State Univ, Ctr Comparat Genom & Bioinformat, State Coll, PA USA","Tyekucheva, Svitlana@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Chiaromonte, Francesca@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University",not exist,"Bagging predictors+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+AUG 1996::Analyzing bagging+Buhlmann, P; Yu, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2002::X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females+Carrel, L; Willard, HF+NATURE+MAR 17 2005::Genomic environment predicts expression patterns on the human inactive X chromosome+Carrel, Laura; Park, Chungoo; Tyekucheva, Svitlana; et al.+PLOS GENETICS+SEP 2006::Genetic and physical maps of Saccharomyces cerevisiae+Cherry, JM; Ball, C; Weng, S; et al.+NATURE+MAY 29 1997::Dimension reduction in regression without matrix inversion+Cook, R.

The resulting distribution is a mixture of chi-square distributed random variables. The results are shown for gamma and positive stable frailty distributions, and hold when covariate information is present. A data example illustrates the tests.

Decision theory classification of high-dimensional vectors based on small samples,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0024-8,MAY 2008,18,1,"In this paper, an entirely new procedure for the classification of high-dimensional vectors on the basis of a few training samples is described. The proposed method is based on the Bayesian paradigm and provides posterior probabilities that a new vector belongs to each of the classes, therefore it adapts naturally to any number of classes. The classification technique is based on a small vector which can be viewed as a regression of the new observation onto the space spanned by the training samples, which is similar to Support Vector Machine classification paradigm. This is achieved by employing matrix-variate distributions in classification, which is an entirely new idea.","support vector machine,decision theory,posterior probabilities,matrix-variate normal distribution","MACHINES,RULE","Bradshaw, David@Univ Cent Florida, Dept Math, Orlando, FL 32816 USA::Pensky, Marianna@Univ Cent Florida, Dept Math, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Bradshaw, David@State University System of Florida@University of Central Florida::Pensky, Marianna@State University System of Florida@University of Central Florida",not exist,"Independent component discriminant analysis+Amato, U; Antoniadis, A; Gregoire, G.+Int J Math+2003::no title+BRADSHAW D+THESIS U CENTRAL FLO+2005::A tutorial on Support Vector Machines for pattern recognition+Burges, CJC+DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY+JUN 1998::CLASSIFICATION OF MULTIPLY OBSERVED DATA+CHOI, SC+BIOMETRISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT+1972::no title+Duda, RO; Hart, PE; Stork, DG.+Pattern classification+2001::no title+Gupta, A.

As analogies of the intraclass and interclass correlations of a normally distributed trait, we study intraclass and interclass (log) odds ratios for a binary trait. We propose non-parametric estimators of the odds ratios and derive the asymptotic variances of the estimators under the assumptions of exchangeability and closure of multivariate binary distributions under marginals. These estimators are straightforward, except for the consideration of how to weight by family size. The relative efficiencies of the non-parametric estimators are studied for some parametric models. It shows that our estimators are highly efficient, and that weighting by family size is recommended for the intraclass odds ratio. The computations of the estimators and their standard errors are illustrated with two examples.","interclass and intraclass odds ratio,familial data,binary trait","ALTERNATING LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS,BINARY DATA","Zhao, Yinshan@Univ British Columbia, Dept Med, MS MRI Res Grp, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada::Joe, Harry@Univ British Columbia, Dept Stat, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada","Zhao, Yinshan@University of British Columbia::Joe, Harry@University of British Columbia",not exist,"MODELING MULTIVARIATE BINARY DATA WITH ALTERNATING LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS+CAREY, V; ZEGER, SL; DIGGLE, P+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1993::no title+DONNER A+APPL STAT+1977::ESTIMATION OF INTRA-CLASS CORRELATION IN THE ANALYSIS OF FAMILY DATA+DONNER, A; KOVAL, JJ+BIOMETRICS+1980::no title+HUNT S+GENET EPIDEMIOL+1988::no title+Joe, H.+Multivariate Models and Dependence Concepts+1997::no title+Kleinbaum, D.

MANOVA for large hypothesis degrees of freedom under non-normality,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0026-6,MAY 2008,27,7,"In this paper asymptotic distributions of the three commonly used multivariate test statistics, viz.: Likelihood Ratio, Lawley-Hotelling and Bartlett-Nanda-Pillai statistics, are studied for one-way MANOVA hypothesis when the responses are non-normal and the hypothesis degrees of freedom is large. The null as well as the non-null distributions are derived for the balanced as well as unbalanced cases. The results show that these statistics have asymptotic normal distributions. A simulation study reveals the approximations are quite good for number of treatments as small as 15 in the null case. Hence, the results can be applied in real life situation where the assumption of multivariate normality is not tenable. Such situations arise, for example, in agricultural screening trials where large number of cultivars are compared with few replications per cultivar.","multivariate analysis of variance,generalized quadratic form,asymptotic distribution,non-normality,null distribution,non-null distribution,balanced design,unbalanced design","MULTIVARIATE LINEAR-HYPOTHESIS,NON-NULL DISTRIBUTIONS,ASYMPTOTIC FORMULAS,3 STATISTICS,VARIANCE,APPROXIMATION,CRITERION,MATRIX,TESTS","Gupta, Arjun K.@Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA::Harrar, Solomon W.@S Dakota State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Brookings, SD 57007 USA::Fujikoshi, Yasunori@Chuo Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Tokyo 112, Japan","Gupta, Arjun K.@Bowling Green State University::Harrar, Solomon W.@South Dakota State University::Fujikoshi, Yasunori@Chuo University",not exist,"Asymptotics for analysis of variance when the number of levels is large+Akritas, M; Arnold, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2000::no title+ANDERSON TW+INTRO MULTIVARIATE A+1984::no title+Arnold, S.

epsilon-Contaminated priors in contingency tables,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0028-4,MAY 2008,29,2,An r x s table is used for different approaches to statistical inference. We develop a Bayesian procedure to test simple null hypotheses versus bilateral alternatives in contingency tables. We consider testing equality of proportions of independent multinomial distributions when the common proportions are known. A lower bound of the posterior probabilities of the null hypothesis is calculated with respect to a mixture of a point prior on the null and an epsilon-contaminated prior on the proportions under the alternative. The resulting Bayes tests are compared numerically to Pearson's chi(2) in a number of examples. For the examined examples the lower bound and the p-value can be made close. The obtained results are generalized when the common proportions vector under the null is unknown or has a known functional form.,"contingency tables,epsilon-contaminated priors,test statistic,critical region,p-values,posterior probabilities,reconciliation","POINT NULL HYPOTHESIS,POSTERIOR PROBABILITY,FREQUENTIST EVIDENCE,LIKELIHOOD RATIO,TESTING PROBLEM,BAYES FACTORS,P-VALUES,INFERENCE","Gomez-Villegas, Miguel A.@Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac CC Matemat, Dept Estadist & Invest Operativa 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain::Gonzalez-Perez, Beatriz@Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac CC Matemat, Dept Estadist & Invest Operativa 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Gomez-Villegas, Miguel A.@Complutense University of Madrid::Gonzalez-Perez, Beatriz@Complutense University of Madrid",not exist,"no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::An overview of robust Bayesian analysis+Berger, J.

(2002, Bisexual Galton-Watson branching process with population-size dependent mating. J Appl Probab 39:479-490). We determine Bayes estimators for the main moments of such processes in both situations: assuming offspring distribution belonging to the bivariate power series family and considering that no assumption is made about the underlying offspring distribution. As illustration we provide several examples, in particular, considering some classical offspring distributions, we explicitly determine the proposed Bayes estimators and, through simulation, we show the evolution of their estimates and of the corresponding high posterior density credibility sets.","bisexual branching processes,population-size dependent processes,Bayesian inference,bivariate power series distributions family",EXTINCTION,"Molina, Manuel@Univ Extremadura, Dept Math, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain::Mota, Manuel@Univ Extremadura, Dept Math, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain::Ramos, Alfonso@Univ Extremadura, Dept Math, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain","Molina, Manuel@Universidad de Extremadura::Mota, Manuel@Universidad de Extremadura::Ramos, Alfonso@Universidad de Extremadura","Mota, Manuel@G-8726-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7012-9027::Ramos, Alfonso@G-7283-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4914-7444::Molina, Manuel@G-8401-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7919-5298","no title+Bernardo, J.

Analyzing skewed data by power normal model,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0030-x,MAY 2008,24,35,"The skew normal distribution, proposed by Azzalini (1985, A class of distributions which include the normal. Scand J Stat 12:171-178), can be a suitable model for the analysis of data exhibiting a unimodal density having some skewness present, a structure often occurring in data analysis. It has been observed that there are some practical problems in estimating the skewness parameter for small to moderate sample sizes. In this paper we point out those problems and propose another skewed model which we call ""Power normal model"". The basic structural properties of the proposed model including its reliability properties are presented. The closeness of skew normal and power normal distributions is investigated. It is shown that the proposed model has some nice properties which make it feasible to study the estimation and testing of the skewness parameter. This can be achieved by transforming the data to the exponential model which has been studied extensively in the literature.","skewed normal distribution,generalized skew normal distribution,skewness parameter,estimation and testing","GENERALIZED EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION,DISTRIBUTIONS,WEIBULL,GAMMA","Gupta, Rameshwar D.@Univ Maine, Univ New Brunswick, Dept Math & Stat, Orono, ME 04469 USA::Gupta, Ramesh C.@Univ Maine, Univ New Brunswick, Dept Math & Stat, Orono, ME 04469 USA","Gupta, Rameshwar D.@University of Maine@University of Maine System@University of Maine Orono::Gupta, Ramesh C.@University of Maine@University of Maine System@University of Maine Orono",not exist,"THE NONTRUNCATED MARGINAL OF A TRUNCATED BIVARIATE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION+ARNOLD, BC; BEAVER, RJ; GROENEVELD, RA; et al.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1993::Skewed multivariate models related to hidden truncation and/or selective reporting+Arnold, BC; Beaver, RJ+TEST+JUN 2002::Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::The reversed hazard rate function+Block, HW; Savits, TH; Singh, H+PROBABILITY IN THE ENGINEERING AND INFORMATIONAL SCIENCES+1998::no title+CHIOGNA M+199715 U PAD DEP STA+1997::Computing maximum likelihood estimates from Type II doubly censored exponential data+Fernandez, A.J.; Bravo, J.I.; De Fuentes, I.+Statistical Methods &amp; Applications+2002::no title+Genton, M.

Nonparametric inference with generalized likelihood ratio tests,TEST,10.1007/s11749-007-0080-8,DEC 2007,106,52,"The advance of technology facilitates the collection of statistical data. Flexible and refined statistical models are widely sought in a large array of statistical problems. The question arises frequently whether or not a family of parametric or nonparametric models fit adequately the given data. In this paper we give a selective overview on nonparametric inferences using generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistics. We introduce generalized likelihood ratio statistics to test various null hypotheses against nonparametric alternatives. The trade-off between the flexibility of alternative models and the power of the statistical tests is emphasized. Well-established Wilks' phenomena are discussed for a variety of semi- and nonparametric models, which sheds light on other research using GLR tests. A number of open topics worthy of further study are given in a discussion section.","asymptotic null distribution,bootstrap,generalized likelihood ratio,Nonparametric test,power function,wilks' phenomenon","VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS,GOODNESS-OF-FIT,SPECTRAL DENSITY-ESTIMATION,LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS,ADDITIVE-MODELS,TIME-SERIES,LINEAR-MODELS,SEMIPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,TERM STRUCTURE","Fan, Jianqing@Princeton Univ, Dept ORFE, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA@Univ N Carolina Charlotte, Dept Math & Stat, Charlotte, NC USA::Jiang, Jiancheng@Princeton Univ, Dept ORFE, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA@Univ N Carolina Charlotte, Dept Math & Stat, Charlotte, NC USA","Fan, Jianqing@Princeton University@University of North Carolina Charlotte@University of North Carolina::Jiang, Jiancheng@Princeton University@University of North Carolina Charlotte@University of North Carolina","Jiang, Jiancheng@G-4792-2016","no title+AITSAHALIA Y+UNPUB NONPARAMETRIC+2005::GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS FOR SPECTRAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1993::ON THE USE OF NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION FOR MODEL CHECKING+AZZALINI, A; BOWMAN, AW; HARDLE, W+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1989::LIKELIHOOD INFERENCE AND TIME-SERIES+BARNARD, GA; JENKINS, GM; WINSTEN, CB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-GENERAL+1962::no title+Berger, J.

Some theorems on conditional mean convergence and conditional almost sure convergence for randomly weighted sums of dependent random variables,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0248-0,JUN 2012,17,25,"In (OrdA +/- ez Cabrera and Volodin, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 305:644-658, 2005), the authors introduce the notion of h-integrability of an array of random variables with respect to an array of constants, and obtained some mean convergence theorems for weighted sums of random variables subject to some special kinds of dependence.

In view of the important role played by conditioning and dependence in the models used to describe many situations in the applied sciences, the concepts and results in the aforementioned paper are extended herein to the case of randomly weighted sums of dependent random variables when a sequence of conditioning sigma-algebras is given. The dependence conditions imposed on the random variables (conditional negative quadrant dependence and conditional strong mixing) as well as the convergence results obtained are conditional relative to the conditioning sequence of sigma-algebras.

In the last section, a strong conditional convergence theorem is also established by using a strong notion of conditional h-integrability.","Conditional residual h-integrability,Randomly weighted sums,Conditional negative dependence,Conditional strong-mixing,Conditional strongly residual h-integrability","CESARO ALPHA-INTEGRABILITY,LARGE NUMBERS,LAWS","Ordonez Cabrera, Manuel@Univ Seville, Dept Math Anal, E-41080 Seville, Spain::Rosalsky, Andrew@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Volodin, Andrei@Univ Regina, Dept Math & Stat, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada","Ordonez Cabrera, Manuel@University of Sevilla::Rosalsky, Andrew@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Volodin, Andrei@University of Regina","Ordonez Cabrera, Manuel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3735-6030","Pair-copula constructions of multiple dependence+Aas, Kjersti; Czado, Claudia; Frigessi, Arnoldo; et al.+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+APR 2009::no title+Basawa, I.

Robust estimates in generalized partially linear single-index models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0249-z,JUN 2012,28,5,"A natural generalization of the well known generalized linear models is to allow only for some of the predictors to be modeled linearly while others are modeled nonparametrically. However, this model can face the so called ""curse of dimensionality"" problem that can be solved by imposing a nonparametric dependence on some unknown projection of the carriers. More precisely, we assume that the observations (y (i) ,x (i) ,t (i) ), 1a parts per thousand currency signia parts per thousand currency signn, are such that t (i) aa""e (q) , x (i) aa""e (p) and y (i) |(x (i) ,t (i) )similar to F(a <...,mu (i) ) with , for some known distribution function F and link function H. The function eta:a""ea dagger'a""e and the parameters alpha and beta are unknown and to be estimated. This model is known as the generalized partly linear single-index model.

In this paper, we introduce a family of robust estimates for the parametric and nonparametric components under a generalized partially linear single-index model. It is shown that the estimates of alpha and beta are root-n consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Through a Monte Carlo study, we compare the performance of the proposed estimators with that of the classical ones.","Asymptotic properties,Generalized partly linear single-index models,Rate of convergence,Robust estimation,Smoothing techniques","SEMIPARAMETRIC MODELS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,LIKELIHOOD,INFERENCE","Boente, Graciela@Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Inst Calculo, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina@Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina::Rodriguez, Daniela@Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Inst Calculo, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina@Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Boente, Graciela@Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)@University of Buenos Aires::Rodriguez, Daniela@Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)@University of Buenos Aires",not exist,"An outlier-robust fit for generalised additive models with applications to outbreak detection+Azadeh, A; Salibian-Barrera, M.+J Am Stat Assoc.+2011::no title+BIANCO A+LECT NOTES STAT+1995::On the asymptotic behavior of one-step estimates in heteroscedastic regression models+Bianco, A; Boente, G+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+NOV 1 2002::Robust estimation for linear regression with asymmetric errors+Bianco, AM; Ben, MG; Yohai, VJ+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 2005::Robust estimates in generalized partially linear models+Boente, Graciela; He, Xuming; Zhou, Jianhui+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2006::Robust inference in generalized partially linear models+Boente, Graciela; Rodriguez, Daniela+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 1 2010::Robust inference for generalized linear models+Cantoni, E; Ronchetti, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::Generalized partially linear single-index models+Carroll, RJ; Fan, JQ; Gijbels, I; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::Implementing the Bianco and Yohai estimator for logistic regression+Croux, C; Haesbroeck, G+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 28 2003::Efficient estimation in conditional single-index regression+Delecroix, M; Hardle, W; Hristache, M+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2003::PROJECTION PURSUIT REGRESSION+FRIEDMAN, JH; STUETZLE, W+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1981::Testing parametric versus semiparametric modeling in generalized linear models+Hardle, W; Mammen, E; Muller, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1998::no title+HARDLE W+NONPARAMETRIC SEMIPA+2006::no title+Hastie, T.J.; Tibshirani, R.+Generalized Additive Models+1990::Estimation in a semiparametric model for longitudinal data with unspecified dependence structure+He, XM; Zhu, ZY; Fung, WK+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::CONDITIONALLY UNBIASED BOUNDED-INFLUENCE ESTIMATION IN GENERAL REGRESSION-MODELS, WITH APPLICATIONS TO GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+KUNSCH, HR; STEFANSKI, LA; CARROLL, RJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1989::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.

Small area estimation via M-quantile geographically weighted regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0231-1,MAR 2012,42,16,"The effective use of spatial information, that is, the geographic locations of population units, in a regression model-based approach to small area estimation is an important practical issue. One approach for incorporating such spatial information in a small area regression model is via Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). In GWR, the relationship between the outcome variable and the covariates is characterised by local rather than global parameters, where local is defined spatially. In this paper, we investigate GWR-based small area estimation under the M-quantile modelling approach. In particular, we specify an M-quantile GWR model that is a local model for the M-quantiles of the conditional distribution of the outcome variable given the covariates. This model is then used to define a bias-robust predictor of the small area characteristic of interest that also accounts for spatial association in the data. An important spin-off from applying the M-quantile GWR small area model is that it can potentially offer more efficient synthetic estimation for out of sample areas. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework through both model-based as well as design-based simulations, with the latter based on a realistic survey data set. The paper concludes with an illustrative application that focuses on estimation of average levels of Acid Neutralising Capacity for lakes in the Northeast of the USA.","Borrowing strength over space,Environmental data,Estimation for out of sample areas,Robust regression,Spatial dependency","LEAST-SQUARES,PREDICTION,MODEL,EBLUP,ERROR","Salvati, N.@Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Stat & Matemat Applicata Econ, Pisa, Italy::Tzavidis, N.@Univ Southampton, Social Stat & Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England::Pratesi, M.@Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Stat & Matemat Applicata Econ, Pisa, Italy::Chambers, R.@Univ Wollongong, Ctr Stat & Survey Methodol, Sch Math & Appl Stat, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia","Salvati, N.@University of Pisa::Tzavidis, N.@University of Southampton::Pratesi, M.@University of Pisa::Chambers, R.@University of Wollongong","Salvati, Nicola@F-8282-2018::SALVATI, NICOLA@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4160-9387::pratesi, monica@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9959-5483","no title+Anselin, L.+Spatial Econometrics: Method and Models+1992::M-QUANTILES+BRECKLING, J; CHAMBERS, R+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1988::Geographically weighted regression: A method for exploring spatial nonstationarity+Brunsdon, C; Fotheringham, AS; Charlton, ME+GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS+OCT 1996::Some notes on parametric significance tests for geographically weighted regression+Brunsdon, C; Fotheringham, AS; Charlton, M+JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE+AUG 1999::On bias-robust mean squared error estimation for linear predictors for domains+Chambers, R; Chandra, H; Tzavidis, N.+Working Papers, 11-09 Centre for Statistical and Survey Methodology+2009::M-quantile models for small area estimation+Chambers, Ray; Tzavidis, Nikos+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2006::ESTIMATING DISTRIBUTION-FUNCTIONS FROM SURVEY DATA+CHAMBERS, RL; DUNSTAN, R+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1986::Small Area Estimation under Transformation to Linearity+Chandra, H.; Chambers, R.+Working paper 10-08+2008::Parametric bootstrap approximation to the distribution of EBLUP and related prediction intervals in linear mixed models+Chatterjee, Snigdhansu; Lahiri, Partha; Li, Huilin+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2008::Fitted smoothed centile curves to reference data+Cole, RJ.+J.

New statistical distributions for group counting in Bernoulli and Poisson processes,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0232-0,MAR 2012,34,1,"Based on a sequential group sampling procedure, the authors introduce a new statistical distribution for group-by-group counting for Bernoulli processes. Suppose that a population contains an infinite number of items, each item having probability p for nonconformity and probability 1-p for conformity. Items are inspected group by group, where each group contains m items, and the number of nonconforming items are recorded only when inspection of a group is completed. The inspection procedure is terminated if the cumulative number of nonconforming items recorded is greater than or equal to a specified number r. The distribution introduced in this paper consists of two random variables: the number of groups inspected, K, and the cumulative number of nonconforming items observed, X. Statistical properties and inferences for the bivariate distribution of (K,X) are studied. The authors also discuss the limiting case as m -> a and p -> 0 with mp fixed, and derive a new bivariate distribution for group-by-group counting for Poisson processes that approaches the gamma distribution in limit. A new type of control chart and an acceptance sampling procedure are developed based on (K,X), and examples are given to illustrate their applications.","Bernoulli process,Gamma distribution,Negative binomial group distribution,Poisson-Gamma group distribution,Poisson process,Sequential group sampling","UNBIASED ESTIMATION,VARIANCE,POPULATION","Cao, Min@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Tai, Allen H.@Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Chan, Ling-Yau@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Cao, Min@University of Hong Kong::Tai, Allen H.@Hong Kong Polytechnic University::Chan, Ling-Yau@University of Hong Kong","Tai, Allen H.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8915-1520","ON ESTIMATING THE SIZE OF MOBILE POPULATIONS FROM RECAPTURE DATA+BAILEY, NTJ+BIOMETRIKA+1951::VARIANCE OF INVERSE BINOMIAL ESTIMATOR+BEST, DJ+BIOMETRIKA+1974::FITTING THE NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION TO BIOLOGICAL DATA - NOTE ON THE EFFICIENT FITTING OF THE NEGATIVE BINOMIAL+BLISS, CI; FISHER, RA+BIOMETRICS+1953::On the central limit theorem for the sum of a random number of independent random variables+Blum, J.

This paper is a study on the stochastic and aging properties of residual lifetime of consecutive k-out-of-n systems under the condition that n-r+1, ra parts per thousand currency signn, components of the system are working at time t. We consider the linear and circular consecutive k-out-of-n systems and propose a mean residual lifetime (MRL) for such systems. Several properties of the proposed MRL is investigated. The mixture representation of the MRL of the systems with respect to the vector of signatures of the system is also studied.","Order statistics,IFR (DFR),Partial ordering,Signature,Mean residual lifetime,Hazard rate,Reliability","COHERENT SYSTEMS,DEPENDENT COMPONENTS,F-SYSTEMS,EXCHANGEABLE LIFETIMES,RELIABILITY","Salehi, E.

A goodness-of-fit test for copula densities,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0217-z,NOV 2011,25,1,"We consider the problem of testing hypotheses on the copula density from a two-dimensional random sample. We test the null hypothesis of a parametric class against a composite nonparametric alternative. Each density under the alternative is separated in the L (2)-norm from any density lying in the null hypothesis. The copula densities under consideration are assumed to belong to a range of Besov balls. According to the minimax approach, the testing problem is solved in an adaptive framework: it leads to a log log loss term in the minimax rate of testing in comparison with the non-adaptive case. A smoothness-free test statistic that achieves the minimax rate is proposed.

Bayesian benchmarking with applications to small area estimation,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0218-y,NOV 2011,22,19,"It is well-known that small area estimation needs explicit or at least implicit use of models (cf. Rao in Small Area Estimation, Wiley, New York, 2003). These model-based estimates can differ widely from the direct estimates, especially for areas with very low sample sizes. While model-based small area estimates are very useful, one potential difficulty with such estimates is that when aggregated, the overall estimate for a larger geographical area may be quite different from the corresponding direct estimate, the latter being usually believed to be quite reliable. This is because the original survey was designed to achieve specified inferential accuracy at this higher level of aggregation. The problem can be more severe in the event of model failure as often there is no real check for validity of the assumed model. Moreover, an overall agreement with the direct estimates at an aggregate level may sometimes be politically necessary to convince the legislators of the utility of small area estimates.

One way to avoid this problem is the so-called ""benchmarking approach"", which amounts to modifying these model-based estimates so that we get the same aggregate estimate for the larger geographical area. Currently, the most popular approach is the so-called ""raking"" or ratio adjustment method, which involves multiplying all the small area estimates by a constant data-dependent factor so that the weighted total agrees with the direct estimate. There are alternate proposals, mostly from frequentist considerations, which meet also the aforementioned benchmarking criterion.

We propose in this paper a general class of constrained Bayes estimators which also achieve the necessary benchmarking. Many of the frequentist estimators, including some of the raked estimators, follow as special cases of our general result. Explicit Bayes estimators are derived which benchmark the weighted mean or both the weighted mean and weighted variability. We illustrate our methodology by developing poverty rates in school-aged children at the state level and then benchmarking these estimates to match at the national level. Unlike the existing frequentist benchmarking literature, which is primarily based on linear models, the proposed Bayesian approach can accommodate any arbitrary model, and the benchmarked Bayes estimators are based only on the posterior mean and the posterior variance-covariance matrix.","Area-level,Penalty parameter,Two-stage,Weighted mean,Weighted variability","SURVEY WEIGHTS,VALUES,MODELS","Datta, G.

To avoid the usual normality assumption and/or hard-to-interpret sensitivity parameters proposed by many authors for such purposes, we consider a simple approach for estimating means, standard deviations and correlations. We do not make distributional assumptions and adopt a pattern-mixture model parameterization which has easily interpreted sensitivity parameters. We use the so-called estimated ignorance and uncertainty intervals to summarize the results and illustrate the proposal with a practical example.

Weighted conditional least square estimators for bisexual branching processes with immigration,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0220-4,NOV 2011,25,0,"The aim of this paper is to study some inferential problems arising from the class of bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes with immigration of females and males (BGWPI). Immigrants are assumed to be unobservable, and it is only possible to sample the number of females, males, and couples (mating units) in each generation. Under these conditions, weighted conditional least square estimators are proposed for the offspring and immigration mean vectors. Asymptotic properties of such estimators are investigated when the process is subcritical and supercritical, paying especial attention to their strong consistency and limit distributions. Weighted conditional least square estimators are also developed for the offspring and immigration variance vectors, and their asymptotic properties are studied. Some comments on the critical case are also given to possibly provide a unified estimation theory for BGWPI.","Bisexual branching processes,Immigration,Weighted conditional least squares,Consistency,Limiting distribution,Subcritical,Supercritical","LIMIT BEHAVIOR,EXTINCTION,BOOTSTRAP","Gonzalez, M.@Univ Extremadura, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Badajoz 06006, Spain::Mota, M.@Univ Extremadura, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Badajoz 06006, Spain::del Puerto, I.@Univ Extremadura, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Badajoz 06006, Spain","Gonzalez, M.@Universidad de Extremadura::Mota, M.@Universidad de Extremadura::del Puerto, I.@Universidad de Extremadura","Mota, Manuel@G-8726-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7012-9027::del Puerto, Ines@H-5112-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1034-2480::Gonzalez, Miguel@N-1399-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7481-6561","EXTINCTION CONDITIONS FOR CERTAIN BISEXUAL GALTON-WATSON BRANCHING PROCESSES+DALEY, DJ+ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WAHRSCHEINLICHKEITSTHEORIE UND VERWANDTE GEBIETE+1968::A MODIFIED BOOTSTRAP FOR BRANCHING-PROCESSES WITH IMMIGRATION+DATTA, S; SRIRAM, TN+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+APR 1995::no title+DURRET R+PROBABILITY THEORY E+1991::no title+Feller, W.+An introduction to probability theory and its applications+1971::Estimation of the offspring distribution and the mean vector for a bisexual Galton-Watson process+Gonzalez, M; Molina, M; Mota, M+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2001::no title+GONZALEZ M+J INTERAM STAT I+1999::no title+GONZALEZ M+MARKOV PROCESSES REL+2002::Limit behaviour for a subcritical bisexual Galton-Watson branching process with immigration+Gonzalez, M; Molina, M; Mota, M+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+AUG 1 2000::On the limit behavior of a supercritical bisexual Galton-Watson branching process with immigration of mating units+Gonzalez, M; Molina, M; Mota, M+STOCHASTIC ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS+NOV 2001::Geometric growth for stochastic difference equations with application to branching populations+Gonzalez, Miguel; Molina, Manuel; Del Puerto, Ines M.+BERNOULLI+OCT 2006::no title+Haccou, P; Jagers, P; Vatutin, VA.+Branching Processes: Variation, Growth and Extinction of Populations+2005::no title+Hall, P; Heyde, CC.+Martingale Limit Theory and Its Application+1980::INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE AND SOME CONVERGENCE RATE RESULTS FOR BRANCHING PROCESSES+HEYDE, CC; BROWN, BM+ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WAHRSCHEINLICHKEITSTHEORIE UND VERWANDTE GEBIETE+1971::A survey of the literature associated with the bisexual Galton-Watson branching process+Hull, DM.+Extracta Math+2003::A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR EXTINCTION IN THOSE BISEXUAL GALTON-WATSON BRANCHING-PROCESSES GOVERNED BY SUPERADDITIVE MATING FUNCTIONS+HULL, DM+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1982::Fluctuation limit of branching processes with immigration and estimation of the means+Ispany, M; Pap, G; Van Zuijlen, MCA+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+JUN 2005::no title+MOLINA M+FAR E J THEOR STAT+2007::Two-Sex Branching Process Literature+Molina, M.+LECT NOTES STAT P+2010::On asymptotic normality of sequential estimators for branching processes with immigration+Qi, Yongcheng+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1 2007::Asymptotic distribution of the CLSE in a critical process with immigration+Rahimov, I.+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+OCT 2008::Estimation of the offspring mean in a controlled branching process with a random control function+Sriram, T.

Quantile-based measures, which come to the fore due to the non-existence of moments, are readily available. The parameters of the distribution have clear interpretations. Limiting distributions as shape parameters tend to their extreme values are especially appealing. The family's simplest sub-class is closely related to a sub-class of the L (U) family. Likelihood based inference is considered and applied in the analysis of heavy-tailed and skew data on fibre glass strengths.

Inference in multivariate Archimedean copula models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0250-6,AUG 2011,43,26,"This paper proposes new rank-based estimators for multivariate Archimedean copulas. The approach stems from a recent representation of these copulas as the survival copulas of simplex distributions. The procedures are based on a reconstruction of the radial part of the simplex distribution from the Kendall distribution, which arises through the multivariate probability integral transformation of the data. In the bivariate case, the methodology is justified by the well known fact that an Archimedean copula is in one-to-one correspondence with its Kendall distribution. It is proved here that this property continues to hold in the trivariate case, and strong evidence is provided that it extends to any dimension. In addition, a criterion is derived for the convergence of sequences of multivariate Archimedean copulas. This result is then used to show consistency of the proposed estimators.","Archimedean copula,Consistency,Frailty,Kendall distribution,Probability integral transform,Radial distribution,Simplex distribution,Weak convergence","PROBABILITY INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION,MONOTONE FUNCTIONS,DISTRIBUTIONS,DEPENDENCE,FAMILIES,SELECTION","Genest, Christian@McGill Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada::Neslehova, Johanna@McGill Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada::Ziegel, Johanna@Heidelberg Univ, Inst Angew Math, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Genest, Christian@McGill University::Neslehova, Johanna@McGill University::Ziegel, Johanna@Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg","Ziegel, Johanna F.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5916-9746","On Kendall's process+Barbe, P; Genest, C; Ghoudi, K; et al.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 1996::no title+Billingsley, P.+Probability and Measure+1995::Spearman's &amp;rho; is larger than Kendall's &amp;tau; for positively dependent random variables+Caperaa, P.; Genest, C.+Journal of Nonparametric Statistics+1993::Convergence of Archimedean copulas+Charpentier, Arthur; Segers, Johan+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAR 2008::no title+Cherubini, U.; Luciano, E.; Vecchiato, W.+Copula Methods in Finance+2004::A FAMILY OF DISTRIBUTIONS FOR MODELING NON-ELLIPTICALLY SYMMETRIC MULTIVARIATE DATA+COOK, RD; JOHNSON, ME+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1981::GeD spline estimation of multivariate Archimedean copulas+Dimitrova, Dimitrina S.; Kaishev, Vladimir K.; Penev, Spiridon I.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 15 2008::no title+Fang, K.; Kotz, S.; Ng, K.+Symmetric Multivariate and Related Distributions+1990::Understanding relationships using copulas+Frees, E.

Kernel estimators of extreme level curves,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0196-0,AUG 2011,42,30,"We address the estimation of extreme level curves of heavy-tailed distributions. This problem is equivalent to estimating quantiles when covariate information is available and when their order converges to one as the sample size increases. We show that, under some conditions, these so-called ""extreme conditional quantiles"" can still be estimated through a kernel estimator of the conditional survival function. Sufficient conditions on the rate of convergence of their order to one are provided to obtain asymptotically Gaussian distributed estimators. Making use of this result, some kernel estimators of the conditional tail-index are introduced and a Weissman type estimator is derived, permitting to estimate extreme conditional quantiles of arbitrary large order. These results are illustrated through simulated and real datasets.","Conditional quantiles,Heavy-tail distributions,Kernel estimator,Extreme-values","NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION,QUANTILE REGRESSION,SAMPLE EXTREMES,BOUNDARIES,INFERENCE,MODELS,INDEX,TAIL","Daouia, Abdelaati@Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, F-31000 Toulouse, France::Gardes, Laurent@INRIA Rhone Alpes, Team Mistis, F-38334 Montbonnot St Martin, St Ismier, France::Girard, Stephane@INRIA Rhone Alpes, Team Mistis, F-38334 Montbonnot St Martin, St Ismier, France::Lekina, Alexandre@INRIA Rhone Alpes, Team Mistis, F-38334 Montbonnot St Martin, St Ismier, France","Daouia, Abdelaati@Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales@PSL Research University Paris@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Toulouse School of Economics@Universite de Toulouse@Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole@Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE)::Gardes, Laurent@Inria::Girard, Stephane@Inria::Lekina, Alexandre@Inria",not exist,"Regression with response distributions of Pareto-type+Beirlant, J; Goegebeur, Y+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 28 2003::Asymptotic normality of convergent estimates of conditional quantiles+Berlinet, A; Gannoun, A; Matzner-Lober, E+STATISTICS+2001::Retrieval of Mars surface physical properties from OMEGA hyperspectral images using regularized sliced inverse regression+Bernard-Michel, C.; Doute, S.; Fauvel, M.; et al.+Journal of Geophysical Research - Part E - Planets+20 June 2009::Gaussian Regularized Sliced Inverse Regression+Bernard-Michel, Caroline; Gardes, Laurent; Girard, Stephane+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAR 2009::no title+Bingham, N.

"Exploring the statistical applicability of the Poincar, inequality: a test of normality",TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0205-3,AUG 2011,25,2,"A new test of normality based on Poincar, inequality is proposed and analyzed. It rests on the characterization of the normal distribution given by Borovkov and Utev, i.e., a r.v. is normal if and only if its Poincar, constant is equal to its variance.

The test statistic is computed by estimating the Poincar, constant via orthonormal polynomials. In case of known expectation and variance, the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is derived under the null hypothesis, and the consistency of the test is proved. An analysis of effects of the degree of polynomials on the procedure is sketched. A Monte Carlo method is used to approximate the distribution when population expectation and variance are replaced by their empirical counterparts. In this framework, we study the level and power of the test for finite samples by means of a simulation experiment including a comparison with other tests.","Asymptotic normality,Borovkov-Utev characterization,Normality test,Orthogonal polynomials,Poincare inequality","NONLINEAR PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,DISTRIBUTIONS,CHERNOFF","Goia, Aldo@Univ Piemonte Orientale A Avogadro Alessandria, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Metodi Quantitat, I-28100 Novara, Italy::Salinelli, Ernesto@Univ Piemonte Orientale A Avogadro Alessandria, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Metodi Quantitat, I-28100 Novara, Italy::Sarda, Pascal@Univ Toulouse 3, Inst Math Toulouse, Equipe LSP, F-31062 Toulouse, France","Goia, Aldo@University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro::Salinelli, Ernesto@University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro::Sarda, Pascal@Universite de Toulouse@Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier@Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE)",not exist,"ASYMPTOTIC THEORY OF CERTAIN GOODNESS OF FIT CRITERIA BASED ON STOCHASTIC PROCESSES+ANDERSON, TW; DARLING, DA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::Testing normality: a GMM approach+Bontemps, C; Meddahi, N+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 2005::no title+BOROVKOV AA+THEOR PROBAB APPL++1984::Characterizations of distributions by generalizations of variance bounds and simple proofs of the CLT+Cacoullos, T; Papathanasiou, V+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 15 1997::CHARACTERIZATION OF PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS BY POINCARE-TYPE INEQUALITIES+CHEN, LHY; LOU, JH+ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE-PROBABILITES ET STATISTIQUES+1987::A NOTE ON AN INEQUALITY INVOLVING THE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION+CHERNOFF, H+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+1981::A SUGGESTION FOR USING POWERFUL AND INFORMATIVE TESTS OF NORMALITY+DAGOSTINO, RB; BELANGER, A; DAGOSTINO, RB+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1990::no title+DAGOSTINO RB+TXB MONOGRAPHS SERIE+1986::no title+DECLERCQ D+ICASSP 97 MUN+1997::ON WIELANDT INEQUALITY AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE ASYMPTOTIC-DISTRIBUTION OF THE EIGENVALUES OF A RANDOM SYMMETRICAL MATRIX+EATON, ML; TYLER, DE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1991::no title+Gautschi, W.+Orthogonal Polynomials: Computation and Approximation+2004::no title+GOIA A+ANN I H POI IN PRESS+2010::EFFICIENT TESTS FOR NORMALITY, HOMOSCEDASTICITY AND SERIAL INDEPENDENCE OF REGRESSION RESIDUALS+JARQUE, CM; BERA, AK+ECONOMICS LETTERS+1980::Fisher information inequalities and the central limit theorem+Johnson, O; Barron, A+PROBABILITY THEORY AND RELATED FIELDS+JUL 2004::ON AN INEQUALITY OF CHERNOFF+KLAASSEN, CAJ+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+1985::ON KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST FOR NORMALITY WITH MEAN AND VARIANCE UNKNOWN+LILLIEFORS, HW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1967::HIGHER-ORDER CONVERGENCE RESULTS FOR RAYLEIGH-RITZ METHOD APPLIED TO EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS .1.

Nonparametric inference based on panel count data,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0223-1,MAY 2011,79,10,"Panel count data usually refer to data arising from studies on recurrent events in which the subjects under study are followed or observed only periodically rather than continuously. In such situations, an objective of interest is about the occurrence of some events that can occur multiple times or repeatedly and the studies resulting in this type of information are often referred to as event history studies. There are many fields such as medical studies, reliability experiments and social sciences wherein panel count data are encountered commonly. This article reviews basic concepts about panel count data, some common issues and questions of interest regarding them as well as the corresponding statistical procedures that are suitable for their analysis. In particular, we will discuss an estimation of the mean function of the underlying counting process characterizing the occurrence of the events, comparison of several processes and analysis of multiple state panel count data.

A general result on the uniform in bandwidth consistency of kernel-type function estimators,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0188-0,MAY 2011,28,14,We develop a general theorem to prove the uniform in bandwidth consistency of kernel-type function estimators. This method unifies the approaches in some other recent papers. We show how to apply our results to kernel distribution function estimators and the smoothed empirical process. The results are applicable to establish strong uniform consistency of data-driven bandwidth kernel-type function estimators.,"Kernel estimation,Distribution function,Uniform in bandwidth","SMOOTHED EMPIRICAL PROCESSES,LIMIT-THEOREMS,OSCILLATION BEHAVIOR,DENSITY ESTIMATORS,WEAK-CONVERGENCE,SELECTION,RATES","Mason, David M.@Univ Delaware, Stat Program, Newark, DE 19716 USA::Swanepoel, Jan W.

Influence diagnostics in a general class of beta regression models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0189-z,MAY 2011,26,17,"In this article, we consider the issue of assessing influence of observations in the general class of beta regression models introduced by Simas et al. (Comput. Stat. Data Anal. 54:348-366, 2010), which is very useful in situations in which the response is restricted to the standard unit interval (0,1). Our results generalize those in Espinheira et al. (Comput. Stat. Data Anal. 52:4417-4431, 2008a; J. Appl. Stat. 35:407-419, 2008b), which only apply to linear beta regression models. We define some residuals, and a Portmanteau test for serial correlation. Further, some influence methods, such as the global, local, and total local influence of an individual and generalized leverage, are discussed. Moreover, we also derive the normal curvatures of local influence under various perturbation schemes. Finally, simulation results and an application to real data show the usefulness of our results.","Beta distribution,Beta regression,Influence diagnostic,Generalized leverage","LOCAL INFLUENCE,PROPORTIONS","Rocha, Andrea V.@Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Estat, BR-58051970 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil::Simas, Alexandre B.@IMPA, Assoc Inst Nacl Matemat Pura & Aplicada, BR-22460320 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Rocha, Andrea V.@Universidade Federal da Paraiba::Simas, Alexandre B.@Instituto Nacional de Matematica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA)","Rocha, Andrea@G-3853-2012","no title+Atkinson, A.

Minimum Hellinger distance based inference for scalar skew-normal and skew-t distributions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0191-5,MAY 2011,29,4,"The skew-normal is a parametric model that extends the normal family by the addition of a shape parameter to account for skewness. As well, the skew-t distribution is generated by a perturbation of symmetry of the basic Student's t density. These families share some nice properties. In particular, they allow a continuous variation through different degrees of asymmetry and, in the case of the skew-t, tail thickness, but still retain relevant features of the perturbed symmetric densities. In both models, a problem occurs in the estimation of the skewness parameter: for small and moderate sample sizes, the maximum likelihood method gives rise to an infinite estimate with positive probability, even when the sample skewness is not too large. To get around this phenomenon, we consider the minimum Hellinger distance estimation technique as an alternative to maximum likelihood. The method always leads to a finite estimate of the shape parameter. Furthermore, the procedure is asymptotically efficient under the assumed model and allows for testing hypothesis and setting confidence regions in a standard fashion.","Estimating function,Hellinger distance,Maximum likelihood,Nonparametric density estimate,Skew-normal,Skew-t","EFFICIENCY,MODELS,ROBUSTNESS","Greco, Luca@Univ Sannio, PE ME IS Dept, Sect Stat, Benevento, Italy","Greco, Luca@University of Sannio",not exist,"Distributions generated by perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on a multivariate skew t-distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::The skew-normal distribution and related multivariate families+Azzalini, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2005::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::Further results on a class of distributions which includes the normal ones+Azzalini, A.+Statistica (Bologna)+1986::Robust likelihood methods based on the skew-t and related distributions+Azzalini, Adelchi; Genton, Marc G.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2008::MINIMUM DISPARITY ESTIMATION FOR CONTINUOUS MODELS - EFFICIENCY, DISTRIBUTIONS AND ROBUSTNESS+BASU, A; LINDSAY, BG+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+DEC 1994::Robust and efficient estimation by minimising a density power divergence+Basu, A; Harris, IR; Hjort, NL; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::MINIMUM HELLINGER DISTANCE ESTIMATES FOR PARAMETRIC MODELS+BERAN, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1977::no title+Bowman, A.

A weighted mean excess function approach to the estimation of Weibull-type tails,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0190-6,MAY 2011,23,3,A new class of estimators for the Weibull-tail coefficient is proposed. The estimators are based on linear combinations of log-spacings of the mean excess function evaluated at high levels. The asymptotic distribution of this new class of estimators is derived under some mild conditions on the weight function and a second order condition on the tail behavior. The finite sample properties of some estimators obtained with important special cases of the weight function are examined with a small simulation experiment.,"Weibull-type distribution,Weibull-tail coefficient,Mean excess function,Bias reduction","ORDER-STATISTICS,LINEAR-COMBINATIONS,COEFFICIENT,INDEX","Goegebeur, Yuri@Univ So Denmark, Dept Math & Comp Sci, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark::Guillou, Armelle@Univ Strasbourg, Inst Rech Math Avancee, UMR 7501, F-67084 Strasbourg, France@CNRS, F-67084 Strasbourg, France","Goegebeur, Yuri@University of Southern Denmark::Guillou, Armelle@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Universite de Strasbourg@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes",not exist,"On exponential representations of log-spacings of extreme order statistics+Beirlant, J.; Dierckx, G.; Guillou, A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Starica, C</span>.+Extremes+2002::THE MEAN RESIDUAL LIFE FUNCTION AT GREAT AGE - APPLICATIONS TO TAIL ESTIMATION+BEIRLANT, J; BRONIATOWSKI, M; TEUGELS, JL; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAY 1995::no title+Beirlant, J; Goegebeur, Y; Segers, J.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Teugels, J</span>.+Statistics of Extremes: Theory and application+2004::no title+Bingham, N.

Discussion about the quality of F-ratio resampling tests for comparing variances,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0194-2,MAY 2011,25,8,The goal of this paper is to describe the quality of different two-sample bootstrap and permutation tests for comparing variances. It is thereby inter alia shown that studentized resampling versions of the classical F-ratio test are asymptotically effective in a general nonparametric setting. This means that there is asymptotic no loss of power under contiguous alternatives. Moreover it is indicated that these tests are asymptotically consistent for fixed alternatives.,"Heterogeneous null distributions,Permutation tests,Bootstrap tests,Power,Studentized statistics,Two-sample tests","RANDOMIZATION TESTS,COVARIANCE MATRICES,PERMUTATION TESTS,BOOTSTRAP METHODS,2-SAMPLE PROBLEM,HYPOTHESES,EQUALITY,HOMOGENEITY,ASSUMPTION","Pauly, Markus@Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Math, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany","Pauly, Markus@Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf",not exist,"no title+Billingsley, Patrick.+Convergence of Probability Measures+1968::RESAMPLING FROM CENTERED DATA IN THE 2-SAMPLE PROBLEM+BOOS, D; JANSSEN, P; VERAVERBEKE, N+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1989::Comparing variances and other measures of dispersion+Boos, DD; Brownie, C+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2004::BOOTSTRAP METHODS FOR TESTING HOMOGENEITY OF VARIANCES+BOOS, DD; BROWNIE, C+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1989::Resampling schemes with low resampling intensity and their applications in testing hypotheses+del Barrio, Eustasio; Janssen, Arnold; Matran, Carlos+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1 2009::Randomization tests+Edgington, ES; Onghena, P.+STAT TXB MONOGRAPHS+2007::no title+Good, Phillip I.+Permutation, parametric and bootstrap tests of hypotheses+2005::no title+Hajek, J; Sidak, Z; Sen, PK.+Theory of Rank Tests+1999::Randomization tests and the equality of variance assumption when comparing group means+Hayes, AF+ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR+MAR 2000::Cautions in testing variance equality with randomization tests+Hayes, AF+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1997::How do bootstrap and permutation tests work?+Janssen, A; Pauls, T+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2003::Resampling student's t-type statistics+Janssen, A+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 2005::no title+JANSSEN A+ASYMPTOTICS EFFECTIV+2009::no title+JANSSEN A+COMPUT STAT+2003::Studentized permutation tests for non-iid hypotheses and the generalized Behrens-Fisher problem+Janssen, A+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+NOV 15 1997::no title+Johnson, N.

A general near-exact distribution theory for the most common likelihood ratio test statistics used in Multivariate Analysis,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0193-3,MAY 2011,22,13,"In this paper we first show how the exact distributions of the most common likelihood ratio test (l.r.t.) statistics, that is, the ones used to test the independence of several sets of variables, the equality of several variance-covariance matrices, sphericity, and the equality of several mean vectors, may be expressed as the distribution of the product of independent Beta random variables or the product of a given number of independent random variables whose logarithm has a Gamma distribution times a given number of independent Beta random variables. Then, we show how near-exact distributions for the logarithms of these statistics may be expressed as Generalized Near-Integer Gamma distributions or mixtures of these distributions, whose rate parameters associated with the integer shape parameters, for samples of size n, all have the form (n-j)/n for j=2,aEuro broken vertical bar,p, where for three of the statistics, p is the number of variables involved, while for the other one, it is the sum of the number of variables involved and the number of mean vectors being tested. What is interesting is that the similarities exhibited by these statistics are even more striking in terms of near-exact distributions than in terms of exact distributions. Moreover all the l.r.t. statistics that may be built as products of these basic statistics also inherit a similar structure for their near-exact distributions. To illustrate this fact, an application is made to the l.r.t. statistic to test the equality of several multivariate Normal distributions.","Wilks lambda statistic,Independence test,Sphericity test,Generalized Integer Gamma distribution,Generalized Near-Integer Gamma distribution,Mixtures","INTEGER GAMMA-DISTRIBUTION,COVARIANCE MATRICES,SPHERICITY","Marques, Filipe J.@Univ Nova Lisboa, Dept Matemat, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal::Coelho, Carlos A.@Univ Nova Lisboa, Dept Matemat, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal::Arnold, Barry C.@Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Stat, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Marques, Filipe J.@Universidade Nova de Lisboa::Coelho, Carlos A.@Universidade Nova de Lisboa::Arnold, Barry C.@University of California System@University of California Riverside","Coelho, Carlos@A-3078-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5628-0625::Marques, Filipe@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6453-6558","no title+Anderson, T.

A general science-based framework for dynamical spatio-temporal models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0209-z,NOV 2010,120,69,"Spatio-temporal statistical models are increasingly being used across a wide variety of scientific disciplines to describe and predict spatially-explicit processes that evolve over time. Correspondingly, in recent years there has been a significant amount of research on new statistical methodology for such models. Although descriptive models that approach the problem from the second-order (covariance) perspective are important, and innovative work is being done in this regard, many real-world processes are dynamic, and it can be more efficient in some cases to characterize the associated spatio-temporal dependence by the use of dynamical models. The chief challenge with the specification of such dynamical models has been related to the curse of dimensionality. Even in fairly simple linear, first-order Markovian, Gaussian error settings, statistical models are often over parameterized. Hierarchical models have proven invaluable in their ability to deal to some extent with this issue by allowing dependency among groups of parameters. In addition, this framework has allowed for the specification of science based parameterizations (and associated prior distributions) in which classes of deterministic dynamical models (e.g., partial differential equations (PDEs), integro-difference equations (IDEs), matrix models, and agent-based models) are used to guide specific parameterizations. Most of the focus for the application of such models in statistics has been in the linear case. The problems mentioned above with linear dynamic models are compounded in the case of nonlinear models. In this sense, the need for coherent and sensible model parameterizations is not only helpful, it is essential. Here, we present an overview of a framework for incorporating scientific information to motivate dynamical spatio-temporal models. First, we illustrate the methodology with the linear case. We then develop a general nonlinear spatio-temporal framework that we call general quadratic nonlinearity and demonstrate that it accommodates many different classes of scientific-based parameterizations as special cases. The model is presented in a hierarchical Bayesian framework and is illustrated with examples from ecology and oceanography.","Bayesian,Hierarchical,Nonlinear,Quadratic,State-space,SST","STATE-SPACE MODELS,STATIONARY COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS,SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES,CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,EL-NINO,CLIMATE MODELS,LINEAR-MODELS,KALMAN FILTER,TIME MODELS,LA-NINA","Wikle, Christopher K.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::Hooten, Mevin B.@Colorado State Univ, USGS Colorado Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Wikle, Christopher K.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::Hooten, Mevin B.@United States Department of the Interior@United States Geological Survey@Colorado State University",not exist,"Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo+Andrieu, C.; Doucet, A.; Holenstein, A.+Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B+2010::Predictive skill of statistical and dynamical climate models in SST forecasts during the 1997-98 El Nino episode and the 1998 La Nina onset+Barnston, AG; Glantz, MH; He, YX+BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY+FEB 1999::Blackbox kriging: spatial prediction without specifying variogram models.+Barry, R.

Comparisons of coherent systems using stochastic precedence,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0207-1,NOV 2010,22,16,"The comparisons of coherent systems is a relevant topic in reliability and survival studies. To this purpose, several techniques have been proposed including comparisons of expected lifetimes or comparisons using stochastic orderings. Recently, Samaniego (System Signatures and Their Applications in Engineering Reliability. International Series in Operations Research & Management Science, vol. 110. Springer, New York, 2007) proposed using stochastic precedence to compare the lifetimes of two independent coherent systems. He proved that if the components in both systems are independent and identically distributed (IID), then these comparisons are distribution free, while comparisons based on expected values are not. In the present paper, we obtain new expressions to compare systems using stochastic precedence without the assumption of IID components. In particular, we show that if the components in both systems are independent and satisfy the Cox proportional hazard rate (PHR) model with the same baseline hazard rate, then these comparisons do not depend on the baseline hazard rate function.","Coherent systems,Stochastic precedence,Signatures,Proportional hazard rate,Exponential distribution","ORDER-STATISTICS,EXCHANGEABLE COMPONENTS,RELIABILITY,SIGNATURES,MIXTURES","Navarro, Jorge@Univ Murcia, Fac Matemat, E-30100 Murcia, Spain::Rubio, Rafael@Univ Murcia, Fac Matemat, E-30100 Murcia, Spain","Navarro, Jorge@University of Murcia::Rubio, Rafael@University of Murcia","Navarro, Jorge@G-4706-2013::NAQVI, SAMEEN@P-4328-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7917-7639","no title+AGRAWAL A+OPER RES+1984::Nonparametric estimation of a distribution subject to a stochastic precedence constraint+Arcones, MA; Kvam, PH; Samaniego, FJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2002::no title+Barlow, R.

Inference based on censored samples from exponentiated populations,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0183-5,NOV 2010,56,4,"Maximum likelihood and Bayes estimators of the parameters, survival and hazard rate functions of an exponentiated population whose cumulative distribution function takes the form H(x)=[G(x)] (alpha) , where alpha is an unknown positive parameter and G(x) is a cumulative distribution function, are obtained in two cases: when the parameters of G(x) are all known so that alpha is the only unknown parameter of H and when the k-dimensional vector of parameters beta of G(x) are all unknown so that the (k+1)-dimensional vector of parameters (alpha,beta) of H is unknown. In both cases, estimation is based on a Type II censored sample. In such cases, the predictive density and predictive survival functions of future observables are obtained when based on the two-sample scheme. This enables us to obtain Bayes prediction bounds of future observables. Subjective priors are used which reflect the prior belief of the experimenter. Numerical results are obtained under three exponentiated models and compared with the results obtained by using the MCMC algorithm.","Exponentiated distribution,Proportional reversed hazard model,Maximum likelihood and Bayes estimation,Type II censoring,Subjective prior,Bayes prediction,Two-sample scheme,MCMC algorithm","WEIBULL-DISTRIBUTION,ORDER-STATISTICS,PREDICTION INTERVALS,DISTRIBUTIONS,FAMILY,GAMMA,MODELS","AL-Hussaini, Essam K.@Univ Alexandria, Dept Math, Alexandria, Egypt","AL-Hussaini, Essam K.@Alexandria University",not exist,"Estimation in step-stress accelerated life tests for the exponentiated exponential distribution with type-I censoring+Abdel-Hamid, Alaa H.; AL-Hussaini, Essam K.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 15 2009::GENERALIZED GOMPERTZ-VERHULST FAMILY OF DISTRIBUTIONS+AHUJA, JC; NASH, SW+SANKHYA-THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS SERIES A+1967::Anewfamily of distributions as a countable mixturewith Poisson added parameters+AL-Hussaini, E.

Smoothed jackknife empirical likelihood method for tail copulas,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0184-4,NOV 2010,32,5,"In this paper we propose a smoothed jackknife empirical likelihood method to construct confidence intervals for tail copulas or tail dependence functions for bivariate extremes. By applying the standard empirical likelihood method for a mean to the smoothed jackknife sample, the empirical likelihood ratio statistic can be calculated by simply solving a single equation. Therefore, this procedure is easy to implement. The Wilks' theorem for the empirical likelihood ratio statistic is proved, and a simulation study prefers the proposed method to the bootstrap method.","Confidence interval,Empirical likelihood,Jackknife,Tail copula","CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION,BANDWIDTH SELECTION,DEPENDENCE FUNCTION,REGIONS,CALIBRATION,RATIO","Peng, Liang@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Math, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Qi, Yongcheng@Univ Minnesota, Dept Math & Stat, Duluth, MN 55812 USA","Peng, Liang@University System of Georgia@Georgia Institute of Technology::Qi, Yongcheng@University of Minnesota Duluth@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System",not exist,"BANDWIDTH SELECTION FOR KERNEL DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION ESTIMATION+ALTMAN, N; LEGER, C+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 1995::Bandwidth selection for the smoothing of distribution functions+Bowman, A; Hall, P; Prvan, T+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1998::Empirical likelihood based confidence intervals for copulas+Chen, Jian; Peng, Liang; Zhao, Yichuan+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2009::Regression modeling for nonparametric estimation of distribution and quantile functions+Cheng, MY; Peng, L+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2002::Empirical likelihood confidence regions for comparison distributions and ROC curves+Claeskens, G; Jing, BY; Peng, L; et al.+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 2003::MODELING EXTREME MULTIVARIATE EVENTS+COLES, SG; TAWN, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::Estimating the probability of a rare event+de Haan, L; Sinha, AK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::Sea and wind: Multivariate extremes at work+de Haan, L.; de Ronde, J.+Extremes+1998::no title+DEHAAN L+EXTREME VALUE THEORY+1996::Best attainable rates of convergence for estimators of the stable tail dependence function+Drees, H; Huang, X+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 1998::MAXIMUM EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF THE SPECTRAL MEASURE OF AN EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTION+Einmahl, John H.

Small area estimators based on restricted mixed models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0186-2,NOV 2010,17,5,"This paper proposes a new model-based approach to estimate small areas that extends the Fay-Herriot methodology. The new model is additive, with a random term to characterize the inter-area variability and a nonparametric mean function specification, defined using the information on an auxiliary variable. The most significant advantage of the proposal is that it avoids the model misspecification problem. The monotonicity is the only assumption about the functional form of the relationship between the variable of interest and the auxiliary one. Estimators for the area means are derived combining ""Order Restricted Inference"" and standard mixed model approaches. A large simulation experiment shows how the new approach outperforms the Fay-Herriot methodology in many scenarios. Besides, the new method is applied to the Australian farms data.","James-Stein estimator,Small areas,Order restricted inference,Mixed models,EBLUP estimator,Fay-Herriot model","PREDICTION,EBLUP","Rueda, Cristina@Univ Valladolid, Dept Estadist & Invest Operativa, E-47005 Valladolid, Spain::Menendez, Jose A.@Univ Valladolid, Dept Estadist & Invest Operativa, E-47005 Valladolid, Spain::Gomez, Federico@Univ Valladolid, Dept Estadist & Invest Operativa, E-47005 Valladolid, Spain","Rueda, Cristina@Universidad de Valladolid::Menendez, Jose A.@Universidad de Valladolid::Gomez, Federico@Universidad de Valladolid",not exist,"M-quantile models for small area estimation+Chambers, Ray; Tzavidis, Nikos+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2006::Parametric bootstrap approximation to the distribution of EBLUP and related prediction intervals in linear mixed models+Chatterjee, Snigdhansu; Lahiri, Partha; Li, Huilin+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2008::no title+DAVID B+CHOOSING METHOD POVE+2003::DATA-ANALYSIS USING STEINS ESTIMATOR AND ITS GENERALIZATIONS+EFRON, B; MORRIS, C+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1975::Estimators of income for small area places: an application of James-Stein procedures to census+Fay, R.; Herriot, R.+J.

Special attention is given to the smoothing parameter selection as well as to implementation issues. The performance of the method is investigated via simulations.

l(1)-penalization for mixture regression models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-010-0197-z,AUG 2010,44,94,"We consider a finite mixture of regressions (FMR) model for high-dimensional inhomogeneous data where the number of covariates may be much larger than sample size. We propose an l(1)-penalized maximum likelihood estimator in an appropriate parameterization. This kind of estimation belongs to a class of problems where optimization and theory for non-convex functions is needed. This distinguishes itself very clearly from high-dimensional estimation with convex loss-or objective functions as, for example, with the Lasso in linear or generalized linear models. Mixture models represent a prime and important example where non-convexity arises.

For FMR models, we develop an efficient EM algorithm for numerical optimization with provable convergence properties. Our penalized estimator is numerically better posed (e.g., boundedness of the criterion function) than unpenalized maximum likelihood estimation, and it allows for effective statistical regularization including variable selection.

Fast and robust estimation of the multivariate errors in variables model,TEST,10.1007/s11749-009-0155-9,AUG 2010,22,3,"In the multivariate errors in variables models, one wishes to retrieve a linear relationship of the form y = beta(t)x + alpha, where both x and y can be multivariate. The variables y and x are not directly measurable, but observed with measurement error. The classical approach to estimate the multivariate errors in variables model is based on an eigenvector analysis of the joint covariance matrix of the observations. In this paper, a projection-pursuit approach is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters. The focus is on projection indices based on half-samples. These lead to robust estimators which can be computed using fast algorithms. Fisher consistency of the procedure is shown, without the need to make distributional assumptions on the x-variables. A simulation study gives insight into the robustness and the efficiency of the procedure.","Errors in variables,Multivariate statistics,Principal components,Projection-pursuit,Robustness","COVARIANCE DETERMINANT ESTIMATOR,TRIMMED K-MEANS,ORTHOGONAL REGRESSION,MATRIX","Croux, Christophe@Leuven Stat Res Ctr, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Fekri, Mohammed@Inst Natl Postes & Telecommun, Rabat, Morocco::Ruiz-Gazen, Anne@Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31000 Toulouse, France","Croux, Christophe@KU Leuven::Fekri, Mohammed@Unknow::Ruiz-Gazen, Anne@Universite de Toulouse@Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole@Toulouse School of Economics@Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE)","Croux, Christophe@E-4386-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2912-3437","ROBUST LINE ESTIMATION WITH ERRORS IN BOTH VARIABLES+BROWN, ML+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1982::ASYMPTOTICS FOR THE MINIMUM COVARIANCE DETERMINANT ESTIMATOR+BUTLER, RW; DAVIES, PL; JHUN, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1993::GENERALIZED M-ESTIMATORS FOR ERRORS-IN-VARIABLES REGRESSION+CHENG, CL; VANNESS, JW+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1992::Robust calibration+Cheng, CL; VanNess, JW+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1997::Principal component analysis based on robust estimators of the covariance or correlation matrix: Influence functions and efficiencies+Croux, C; Haesbroeck, G+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2000::Influence function and efficiency of the minimum covariance determinant scatter matrix estimator+Croux, C; Haesbroeck, G+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+NOV 1999::Trimmed k-means: An attempt to robustify quantizers+Cuesta-Albertos, JA; Gordaliza, A; Matran, C+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1997::Robust weighted orthogonal regression in the errors-in-variables model+Fekri, M; Ruiz-Gazen, A+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2004::no title+Fuller, W.

Autocorrelation-based tests for vector error correction models with uncorrelated but nonindependent errors,TEST,10.1007/s11749-009-0156-8,AUG 2010,24,3,"We consider in this paper the estimation and test-of-fit for vector error correction models with nonindependent innovations. The asymptotic properties of the residual sample autocorrelations are derived. It is shown that the asymptotic distribution can be quite different for models with iid innovations and models in which the innovations are nonindependent. Consequently, the usual chi-square distribution does not provide an adequate approximation of the distribution of the Box-Pierce goodness-of-fit portmanteau statistic in the presence of nonindependent innovations. We thus propose modified portmanteau and Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests whose asymptotic distributions are a weighted sums of independent chi-squared random variables. Monte Carlo experiments illustrate the finite sample performance of the different tests.","Cointegration,Weak error process,Portmanteau tests,Lagrange multiplier test,Vector error correction model","TIME-SERIES MODELS,GENERALIZED ARCH,NORMAL VARIABLES,QUADRATIC-FORMS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Raissi, Hamdi@INSA IRMAR, F-35043 Rennes, France","Raissi, Hamdi@Unknow",not exist,"Maximum likelihood estimation for all-pass time series models+Andrews, B; Davis, RA; Breidt, FJ+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2006::Multivariate GARCH models: A survey+Bauwens, L; Laurent, S; Rombouts, JVK+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 2006::MODELING THE COHERENCE IN SHORT-RUN NOMINAL EXCHANGE-RATES - A MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZED ARCH MODEL+BOLLERSLEV, T+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1990::Distribution of residual autocorrelations in the autoregressive-integrated moving average time series models+Box, GEP; Pierce, DA.+J Am Stat Assoc+1970::TESTING FOR AUTOCORRELATION IN DYNAMIC LINEAR-MODELS+BREUSCH, TS+AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS+1978::Residual autocorrelation testing for vector error correction models+Brueggemann, Ralf; Luetkepohl, Helmut; Saikkonen, Pentti+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 2006::DISTRIBUTION OF RESIDUAL AUTOCORRELATIONS IN MULTIPLE AUTOREGRESSIVE SCHEMES+CHITTURI, RV+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::CONVERGENCE OF DISTRIBUTIONS GENERATED BY STATIONARY STOCHASTIC PROCESSES+DAVYDOV, YA+THEORY OF PROBILITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS,USSR+1968::Testing for serial correlation of unknown form in cointegrated time series models+Duchesne, P+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 2005::MULTIVARIATE SIMULTANEOUS GENERALIZED ARCH+ENGLE, RF; KRONER, KF+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+MAR 1995::Estimating linear representations of nonlinear processes+Francq, C; Zakoian, JM+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAY 1 1998::Diagnostic checking in ARMA models with uncorrelated errors+Francq, C; Roy, R; Zakoian, JM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2005::Multivariate portmanteau test for autoregressive models with uncorrelated but nonindependent errors+Francq, Christian; Raissi, Hamdi+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAY 2007::TESTING FOR HIGHER-ORDER SERIAL-CORRELATION IN REGRESSION EQUATIONS WHEN REGRESSORS INCLUDE LAGGED DEPENDENT VARIABLES+GODFREY, LG+ECONOMETRICA+1978::A FUNCTIONAL CENTRAL LIMIT-THEOREM FOR WEAKLY DEPENDENT SEQUENCES OF RANDOM-VARIABLES+HERRNDORF, N+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+1984::no title+HOSKING JRM+J AM STAT ASSOC+1980::COMPUTING DISTRIBUTION OF QUADRATIC FORMS IN NORMAL VARIABLES+IMHOF, JP+BIOMETRIKA+1961::Strong consistency of estimators for multivariate ARCH models+Jeantheau, T+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+FEB 1998::no title+Johansen, S.+Likelihood-based inference in Cointegrated vector autoregressive models+1995::Saddlepoint approximations for distributions of quadratic forms in normal variables+Kuonen, D+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1999::MEASURE OF LACK OF FIT IN TIME-SERIES MODELS+LJUNG, GM; BOX, GEP+BIOMETRIKA+1978::no title+Lutkepohl,, H.+New introduction to multiple time series analysis+2005::Testing the Cointegrating Rank with Uncorrelated but Dependent Errors+Raissi, Hamdi+STOCHASTIC ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS+2009::Inference for autocorrelations under weak assumptions+Romano, JP; Thombs, LA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996"
Progressive censoring under inverse sampling for nonparametric multi-sample location problem,TEST,10.1007/s11749-009-0157-7,AUG 2010,21,1,"In this study, we propose a class of distribution-free progressive censoring test procedures for multi-sample location problem using a stage-wise partially sequential sampling technique. For this, we draw a fixed number of sample observations from one of the populations (say, control) and random number of observations from other populations (say, treatments) using suitable stopping rules. At each stage, two types of control groups, termed as fixed control group (FCG) and updated control group (UCG), are considered. Suitable stopping rules are constructed based on quantiles of the FCG and UCG observations separately. At each stage, FCG consists of initial control observations only; while UCG consists of stage-wise updated combined control observations and previous treatment observations. We examined different large sample results of the proposed tests. We also performed numerical studies to compare the performance of the tests based on FCG and UCG procedures. In addition, we compared the performance of the progressive censoring test procedures with the corresponding competitive terminal test procedure numerically.","Distribution-free,Fixed control group procedure,Inverse sampling,Multi-sample problem,Partially sequential tests,Progressive censoring,Updated control group procedure","CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,QUANTILES,TESTS","Chattopadhyay, Gopaldeb@Govt West Bengal, Bur Appl Econ & Stat, Burdwan 713101, W Bengal, India::Mukhopadhyay, Indranil@Govt West Bengal, Bur Appl Econ & Stat, Burdwan 713101, W Bengal, India","Chattopadhyay, Gopaldeb@Unknow::Mukhopadhyay, Indranil@Unknow",not exist,"Homogeneity tests based on several progressively Type-II censored samples+Alvarez-Andrade, S.; Balakrishnan, N.; Bordes, L.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 2007::Empirical quantile process under type-II progressive censoring+Alvarez-Andrade, S; Bordes, L+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 1 2004::The integral of a symmetric unimodal function over a symmetric convex set and some probability inequalities+Anderson, Theodore Wilbur.+Proc.

Adaptive progressive Type-II censoring,TEST,10.1007/s11749-009-0167-5,AUG 2010,22,13,"Extending the model of progressive Type-II censoring, we introduce an adaption process. It allows us to choose the next censoring number taking into account both the previous censoring numbers and previous failure times. After deriving some distributional results, we show that maximum likelihood estimators coincide with those in deterministic progressive Type-II censoring. Finally, we establish inferential results for the one-and two-parameter exponential distribution. Using the independence of normalized spacings, we present the distributions of the maximum likelihood estimators.

Extremes of integer-valued moving average sequences,TEST,10.1007/s11749-009-0158-6,AUG 2010,17,7,"This paper aims to analyze the extremal properties of integer-valued moving average sequences obtained as discrete analogues of conventional moving averages replacing scalar multiplication by binomial thinning. In particular, we consider the case in which the scalar coefficients are replaced by random coefficients since in real applications the thinning probabilities may depend on several factors changing in time. Furthermore, the extremal behavior of periodic integer-valued moving average sequences is also considered. In this case, we find that, when assessing their clustering tendency of high-threshold exceedances, the extremal index is the same as for the stationary case.","Extreme value theory,Binomial thinning,Extremal index,Integer-valued sequences",TIME-SERIES,"Hall, Andreia@Univ Aveiro, Dept Matemat, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal::Scotto, Manuel@Univ Aveiro, Dept Matemat, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal::Cruz, Joao@Univ Aveiro, Dept Matemat, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal","Hall, Andreia@Universidade de Aveiro::Scotto, Manuel@Universidade de Aveiro::Cruz, Joao@Universidade de Aveiro","Scotto, Manuel@F-6020-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8427-2684::Hall, Andreia@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8759-7927::Cruz, Joao Pedro@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3781-5660","EXTREME VALUE THEORY FOR A CLASS OF DISCRETE DISTRIBUTIONS WITH APPLICATIONS TO SOME STOCHASTIC PROCESSES+ANDERSON, CW+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1970::Estimation in integer-valued moving average models+Brannas, K; Hall, A+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY+JUL-SEP 2001::Tourist accommodation effects of festivals.+Brannas, K.; Nordstrom, J.+Tourism Economics+2006::CALCULATING THE EXTREMAL INDEX FOR A CLASS OF STATIONARY-SEQUENCES+CHERNICK, MR; HSING, TL; MCCORMICK, WP+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+DEC 1991::ABEL-TAUBER THEOREM FOR LAPLACE TRANSFORMS+DEHAAN, L+JOURNAL OF THE LONDON MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY-SECOND SERIES+1976::no title+Embrechts, P.; Kluppelberg, C.; Mikosch, T.+Modelling Extremal Events for Insurance and Finance+1997::no title+Feller, W.+An introduction to probability theory and its applications+1971::Extremes of integer-valued moving averages models with regularly varying tails+Hall, A.+Extremes+2001::Extremes of periodic integer-valued sequences with exponential type tails+Hall, A.; Scotto, M.+Revstat-Statistical Journal+2006::no title+Hipel, KW; Mcleod, AI.+TIME SERIES MODELLIN+1994::no title+MacDonald, IL; Zucchini, W.+Hidden Markov and other models for discrete-valued time series+1997::no title+MARTINS AP+SORT+2004::ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS OF EXTREMES FROM AUTOREGRESSIVE NEGATIVE BINOMIAL PROCESSES+MCCORMICK, WP; PARK, YS+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+DEC 1992::Bivariate time series modeling of financial count data+Quoreshi, A.

Multivariate plug-in bandwidth selection with unconstrained pilot bandwidth matrices,TEST,10.1007/s11749-009-0168-4,AUG 2010,31,45,"Multivariate kernel density estimation is an important technique in exploratory data analysis. Its utility relies on its ease of interpretation, especially by graphical means. The crucial factor which determines the performance of kernel density estimation is the bandwidth matrix selection. Research in finding optimal bandwidth matrices began with restricted parameterizations of the bandwidth matrix which mimic univariate selectors. Progressively these restrictions were relaxed to develop more flexible selectors. In this paper, we propose the first plug-in bandwidth selector with the unconstrained parameterizations of both the final and pilot selectors. Up till now, the development of unconstrained pilot selectors was hindered by the traditional vectorization of higher-order derivatives which lead to increasingly intractable matrix algebraic expressions. We resolve this by introducing an alternative vectorization which gives elegant and tractable expressions. This allows us to quantify the asymptotic and finite sample properties of unconstrained pilot selectors. For target densities with intricate structure (such as multimodality), our unconstrained selectors show the most improvement over the existing plug-in selectors.","Asymptotic MISE,Multivariate kernel density estimation,Plug-in method,Pre-sphering,Unconstrained bandwidth selectors","KERNEL DENSITY-ESTIMATION,CROSS-VALIDATION,DERIVATIVES,ESTIMATORS,CHOICE","Chacon, J.

Another generalization of the geometric distribution,TEST,10.1007/s11749-009-0169-3,AUG 2010,22,37,"A new generalization of the geometric distribution with parameters alpha > 0 and 0 < theta < 1 is obtained in this paper. This can be done either by using the Marshall and Olkin (Biometrika 84(3), 641-652, 1997) scheme and adding a parameter to the geometric distribution or by starting with the generalized exponential distribution in Marshall and Olkin (Biometrika 84(3), 641-652, 1997) and discretizing this continuous distribution. The particular case alpha = 1 led us to the geometric distribution. After reviewing some of its properties, we investigated the question of parameter estimation. The new distribution is unimodal with a failure rate that is monotonically increasing or decreasing, depending on the value of the parameter alpha. Expected frequencies were calculated for two overdispersed and infradispersed examples, and the distribution was found to provide a very satisfactory fit.","Branching process,Discretizing,Failure rate,Fitting,Geometric distribution","POISSON-DISTRIBUTION,DISCRETE","Gomez-Deniz, E.@Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Quantitat Methods, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain","Gomez-Deniz, E.@Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria",not exist,"no title+Andrews, GE; Askey, R; Roy, R.+Special Functions, Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications+1999::GENERALIZATION OF POISSON DISTRIBUTION+CONSUL, PC; JAIN, GC+TECHNOMETRICS+1973::The distribution of time to extinction in subcritical branching processes: Applications to outbreaks of infectious disease+Farrington, CP; Grant, AD+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+SEP 1999::On the monotonic properties of discrete failure rates+Gupta, PL; Gupta, RC; Tripathi, RC+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 15 1997::A class of Hurwitz-Lerch Zeta distributions and their applications in reliability+Gupta, Pushpa L.; Gupta, Ramesh C.; Ong, Seng-Huat; et al.+APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION+MAR 1 2008::THE PLACE OF MATHEMATICS IN MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL STATISTICS+IRWIN, JO+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-GENERAL+1963::GENERALIZED NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION+JAIN, GC; CONSUL, PC+SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS+1971::On a generalization to Marshall-Olkin scheme and its application to Burr type XII distribution+Jayakumar, K.; Mathew, Thomas+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUL 2008::Univariate Discrete Distributions, 3rd Edition+Johnson, NL; Kemp, AW; Kotz, S+UNIVARIATE DISCRETE DISTRIBUTIONS, 3RD EDITION+2005::SOME RESULTS FOR DISCRETE UNIMODALITY+KEILSON, J; GERBER, H+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::The Discrete Half-Normal Distribution+Kemp, Adrienne W.+ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL AND STATISTICAL MODELING+2008::HEINE-EULER EXTENSIONS OF THE POISSON-DISTRIBUTION+KEMP, AW+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1992::Discrete Burr and discrete Pareto Distributions+Krishna, H.; Pundir, P.S.+Statistical Methodology+2009::A generalization of the geometric distribution and its application in quantitative linguistics+Makcutek, J.+Romanian Rep.

Dynamic relations for sparsely sampled Gaussian processes,TEST,10.1007/s11749-009-0176-4,MAY 2010,83,6,"In longitudinal studies, it is common to observe repeated measurements data from a sample of subjects where noisy measurements are made at irregular times, with a random number of measurements per subject. Often a reasonable assumption is that the data are generated by the trajectories of a smooth underlying stochastic process. In some cases, one observes multivariate time courses generated by a multivariate stochastic process. To understand the nature of the underlying processes, it is then of interest to relate the values of a process at one time with the value it assumes at another time, and also to relate the values assumed by different components of a multivariate trajectory at the same time or at specific times selected for each trajectory. In addition, an assessment of these relationships will allow to predict future values of an individual's trajectories.

Derivatives of the trajectories are frequently more informative than the time courses themselves, for instance, in the case of growth curves. It is then of great interest to study the estimation of derivatives from sparse data. Such estimation procedures permit the study of time-dynamic relationships between derivatives and trajectory levels within the same trajectory and between the components of multivariate trajectories. Reviewing and extending recent work, we demonstrate the estimation of corresponding empirical dynamical systems and demonstrate asymptotic consistency of predictions and dynamic transfer functions. We illustrate the resulting prediction procedures and empirical first-order differential equations with a study of the dynamics of longitudinal functional data for the relationship of blood pressure and body mass index.","Derivatives,Eigenfunction,Functional data analysis,Gaussian process","VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS,FUNCTIONAL LINEAR-REGRESSION,PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,SEMIPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,CANONICAL CORRELATION,STOCHASTIC-PROCESSES,STATISTICAL-METHODS,SPLINE ESTIMATION,AUCTION DYNAMICS","Mueller, Hans-Georg@Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Davis, CA 95616 USA::Yang, Wenjing@Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Mueller, Hans-Georg@University of California System@University of California Davis::Yang, Wenjing@University of California System@University of California Davis",not exist,"no title+ASH RB+PROBABILITY MATH STA+1975::PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS OF SAMPLED FUNCTIONS+BESSE, P; RAMSAY, JO+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 1986::Prediction in functional linear regression+Cai, T.

We derive the relevant formulas for the combined ordered samples to construct confidence intervals for a given quantile, prediction intervals, and tolerance intervals. The results are valid for every continuous distribution function. The key results are the derivations of the marginal distribution functions in the combined ordered samples. In the case of ordinary Type-II right censored order statistics, it is shown that the combined ordered sample is no longer distributed as order statistics. Instead, the distribution in the combined ordered sample is closely related to progressively Type-II censored order statistics.","Right censored order statistics,Progressively type-II right censored order statistics,Nonparametric confidence intervals,Nonparametric prediction intervals,Nonparametric tolerance intervals,Mixtures of mixtures of order statistics","GENERALIZED ORDER-STATISTICS,DISTRIBUTIONS,QUANTILES,INFERENCE,SAMPLES,LIFE","Balakrishnan, N.@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada::Beutner, E.@Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands::Cramer, E.@Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Stat, D-52056 Aachen, Germany","Balakrishnan, N.@McMaster University::Beutner, E.@Maastricht University::Cramer, E.@RWTH Aachen University","Cramer, Erhard@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8354-5425","Empirical quantile process under type-II progressive censoring+Alvarez-Andrade, S; Bordes, L+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 1 2004::no title+Arnold, B.

Approximations to most powerful invariant tests for multinormality against some irregular alternatives,TEST,10.1007/s11749-008-0136-4,MAY 2010,22,2,"The problem of testing multinormality against some alternatives invariant with respect to a subgroup of affine transformations is studied. Using the Laplace expansion for integrals, some approximations to the most powerful invariant (MPI) tests are derived. The cases of bivariate exponential and bivariate uniform alternatives are studied in detail, whereas higher-dimensional extensions are only outlined. Those alternatives are irregular and need a special treatment because of the dependence of their supports on the unknown parameters. It is shown that likelihood ratio (LR) tests are asymptotically equivalent to the MPI tests. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that the powers of the LR tests are very close to the powers of the MPI tests, even in small samples.","Invariant test,Laplace expansion,Likelihood ratio test,Tests for multinormality","LIKELIHOOD,MODELS","Majerski, Piotr@AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Appl Math, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland::Szkutnik, Zbigniew@AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Appl Math, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland","Majerski, Piotr@AGH University of Science & Technology::Szkutnik, Zbigniew@AGH University of Science & Technology","Szkutnik, Zbigniew@B-2214-2014::Majerski, Piotr@K-5229-2012","DISTRIBUTIONS OF MAXIMAL INVARIANTS USING QUOTIENT MEASURES+ANDERSSON, S+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::Relations, bounds and approximations for order statistics+Arnold, B.

Alternative Bayes factors: Sample size determination and discriminatory power assessment,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0017-7,DEC 2007,32,2,"Alternative Bayes factors are families of methods used for hypothesis testing and model selection when sensitivity to priors is a concern and also when prior information is weak or lacking. This paper deals with two related problems that arise in the practical use of these model choice criteria: sample size determination and evaluation of discriminatory power. We propose a pre-experimental approach to cope with both these issues. Specifically, extending the evidential approach of Royall (J Am Stat Assoc 95(451): 760-780, 2000) and following De Santis (J Stat Plan Inference 124(1): 121-144, 2004), we propose a criterion for sample size choice based on the predictive probability of observing decisive and correct evidence. The basic idea is to select the minimal sample size that guarantees a sufficiently high pre-experimental probability that an alternative Bayes factor provides strong evidence in favor of the true hypothesis. It is also argued that a predictive analysis is a natural approach to the measurement of discriminatory power of alternative Bayes factors. The necessity of measuring discrimination ability depends on the fact that alternative Bayes factors are, in general, less sensitive to prior specifications than ordinary Bayes factors and that this gain in robustness corresponds to a reduced discriminative power.

A maxiset approach of a Gaussian noise model,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0018-6,DEC 2007,21,3,"We consider the problem of estimating an unknown function f in a Gaussian noise setting under the global L-p risk. The particularity of the model considered is that it utilizes a secondary function v which complicates the estimate significantly. While varying the assumptions on this function, we investigate the minimax rate of convergence over two types of Besov balls. One is defined as usual and the other belongs to the family of weighted spaces. Adopting the maxiset approach, we show that a natural hard thresholding procedure attained the minimax rate of convergence within a logarithmic factor over such weighted Besov balls.","Gaussian noise,warped wavelets,Besov spaces,minimax,muckenhoupt weights,wavelet thresholding,maxiset","WEIGHTED NORM INEQUALITIES,ASYMPTOTIC EQUIVALENCE,WHITE-NOISE,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION","Chesneau, Christophe@Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR7599, Lab Probabil & Model Aleatoires, F-75013 Paris, France","Chesneau, Christophe@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Sorbonne Universite","chesneau, christophe@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1522-9292","no title+AUTIN F+THESIS U PARIS 7 LAB+2005::Asymptotic equivalence of nonparametric regression and white noise+Brown, LD; Low, MG+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1996::Maximal spaces with given rate of convergence for thresholding algorithms+Cohen, A; DeVore, R; Kerkyacharian, G; et al.+APPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL HARMONIC ANALYSIS+SEP 2001::Wavelets on the interval and fast wavelet transforms+Cohen, A.; Daubechies, I.; Vial, P.+Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis+Dec. 1993::WEIGHTED NORM INEQUALITIES FOR MAXIMAL FUNCTIONS AND SINGULAR INTEGRALS+COIFMAN, RR; FEFFERMAN, C+STUDIA MATHEMATICA+1974::no title+Daubechies, I.+10 LECT WAVELETS CBM+1992::Adapting to unknown smoothness via wavelet shrinkage+Donoho, DL; Johnstone, IM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Sharp-optimal and adaptive estimation for heteroscedastic nonparametric regression+Efromovich, S; Pinsker, M+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 1996::Wavelet Characterization of Weighted Spaces+Garcia-Cuerva, J.; Martell, J.

Score tests for independence in parametric competing risks models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0019-5,DEC 2007,25,3,A popular model for competing risks postulates the existence of a latent unobserved failure time for each risk. Assuming that these underlying failure times are independent is attractive since it allows standard statistical tools for right-censored lifetime data to be used in the analysis. This paper proposes simple independence score tests for the validity of this assumption when parametric regression models are used to model the individual risks. The score tests are derived for the alternatives that specify that copulas are responsible for a possible dependency between competing risks. The test statistics are functions of the Cox and Snell residuals. A variance estimator is derived by writing the score function and the Fisher information matrix for the marginal models as stochastic integrals.

Semi-parametric approach to the Hasofer-Wang and Greenwood statistics in extremes,TEST,10.1007/s11749-007-0010-1,AUG 2007,25,9,"This paper deals with the semi-parametric approach to the problem of statistical choice of extreme domains of attraction. Relying on concepts of regular variation theory, it investigates the asymptotic properties of Hasofer and Wang's test statistic based on the k upper extremes taken from a sample of size n, when k behaves as an intermediate sequence k(n) rather than remaining fixed while the sample size increases. In the process a Greenwood type test statistic is proposed which turns out to be useful in discriminating heavy-tailed distributions. The finite sample behavior of both testing procedures is evaluated in the light of a simulation study. The testing procedures are then applied to three real data sets.","max-domain of attraction,heavy-tailed distribution,regular variation theory,hypothesis testing","GENERALIZED PARETO DISTRIBUTION,ORDER-STATISTICS,ATTRACTION,DOMAIN,MAXIMUM","Neves, Claudia@Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, DEIO, CEAUL, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Aveiro, Dept Math, UIMA, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal::Alves, M.

Optional randomized response in stratified unequal probability sampling - A simulation based numerical study with Kuk's method,TEST,10.1007/s11749-007-0013-y,AUG 2007,16,3,"Warner's pioneering randomized response (RR) device, as a method for reducing evasive answer bias while estimating the proportion of people in a community bearing a sensitive attribute, has been studied extensively over the last four decades. In many practical surveys it was observed that a character considered to be stigmatizing by a group of respondents did not appear to be such to another group, and direct responses (DR's) to divulge its true characteristics were offered. Chaudhuri and Mukerjee (Calcutta Stat Assoc Bull 34:225-229, 1985; Randomized response: theory and techniques. Dekker, New York, 1988) introduced the concept of optional RR (ORR) to accommodate direct responses offered by such respondents. Since unequal probability stratified sampling is followed in large-scale socio-economic surveys, it is necessary to develop RR procedures for such complex surveys. Kuk's method is extended to varying probability stratified sampling when RR's as well as DR's are permitted. A numerical study comparing the performance of alternative procedures is also reported.","compulsory randomized response,direct response,Kuk's method,stratified unequal probability sampling",MODEL,"Saha, Amitava@Directorate Gen Mines Safety, Dhanbad 826001, Jharkhand, India","Saha, Amitava@Unknow",not exist,"Optionally randomized response technique+CHAUDHURI, A.; MUKHERJEE, R.+Calcutta Statist.

A unified approach to residuals, leverages and outliers in the linear mixed model is developed. Formal and informal procedures are proposed to display the general features of residuals and leverages in order to detect outliers and high-leverage points in the linear mixed models. The relationship between the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) and residuals is established. Some properties of BLUPs are formulated and their use in detecting outlying observations are investigated.","best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP),case deletion,leverages,outliers,predicted residuals,variance ratios","DIAGNOSTICS,PREDICTION","Zewotir, Temesgen@Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Stat & Acturial Sci, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa@Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Stat & Actuarial Sci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa::Galpin, Jacky S.@Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Stat & Acturial Sci, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa@Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Stat & Actuarial Sci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa","Zewotir, Temesgen@University of Kwazulu Natal@University of Witwatersrand::Galpin, Jacky S.@University of Kwazulu Natal@University of Witwatersrand","Zewotir, Temesgen Tenaw@N-5353-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1503-8055","RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VARIABLE SELECTION AND DATA AUGMENTATION AND A METHOD FOR PREDICTION+ALLEN, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::no title+Barnett, V.; Lewis, T.+Outliers in Statistical Data+1995::PREDICTION DIAGNOSTICS FOR SPATIAL LINEAR-MODELS+CHRISTENSEN, R; JOHNSON, W; PEARSON, LM+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1992::CASE-DELETION DIAGNOSTICS FOR MIXED MODELS+CHRISTENSEN, R; PEARSON, LM; JOHNSON, W+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::ROBUST ESTIMATION OF VARIANCE-COMPONENTS+FELLNER, WH+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::REJECTION OF A SINGLE OUTLIER IN 2-WAY OR 3-WAY LAYOUTS+GALPIN, JS; HAWKINS, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+1981::no title+GRAYBILL FA+INTRO MATRICES APPL+1969::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION FOR MIXED ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE MODEL+HARTLEY, HO; RAO, JNK+BIOMETRIKA+1967::BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) and beyond.+Harville, D.

A third-order bias corrected estimate in generalized linear models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0002-1,MAY 2007,27,5,"Cordeiro and McCullagh (J Roy Stat Soc Ser B 53:629-643, 1991) derived a second-order bias-corrected estimate, which displays smaller bias than the classical maximum likelihood estimate in generalized linear models. This estimate, although consistent, can display pronounced bias in small to moderately large samples, as shown by Monte Carlo simulations here. In this paper, we obtain a simple matrix formula for the bias of order n(-2) of this estimate, where n is the sample size, and define a third-order bias-corrected estimate in this class of models, which displays much smaller bias in small samples. In particular, some Monte Carlo simulations show that our new estimate can deliver substantial improvements in terms of bias and mean squared errors over the usual maximum likelihood estimate and Cordeiro and McCullagh's estimate.","bias correction,canonical model,cumulant,gamma model,generalized linear model,maximum likelihood estimate,mean squared error","LIKELIHOOD RATIO STATISTICS,NONLINEAR-REGRESSION MODELS","Cordeiro, Gauss M.@Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Estatist & Informat, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Estatist, Sao Paulo, Brazil::Barroso, Lucia P.@Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Estatist & Informat, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Estatist, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Cordeiro, Gauss M.@Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE)@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Barroso, Lucia P.@Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE)@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Cordeiro, Gauss@J-7210-2012","no title+BOWMAN KO+BIASES COVARIANCES M+1965::BIAS IN NONLINEAR ESTIMATION+BOX, MJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1971::BIAS IN NONLINEAR-REGRESSION+COOK, RD; TSAI, CL; WEI, BC+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1986::Second-order biases of the maximum likelihood estimates in von Mises regression models+Cordeiro, G.M.; Vasconcellos, K.L.P.+Aust.

Consistency results on nonparametric Bayesian estimation of level sets using spatial priors,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-003-0,MAY 2007,23,0,"The main purpose of this paper is to propose a Bayesian nonparametric estimation of density's level sets from n independent identically distributed observations. We prove the strong consistency of posterior distribution under a fairly general class of priors. This entails, in particular, that the Bayes estimate of the level set is consistent in terms of the Lebesgue measure of the symmetric difference. The considered priors put mass on piecewise-constant densities. The pieces on which the densities are constant are Voronoi tiles generated by a spatial point process. Using conditions similar to those considered in the density framework, we also obtain the consistency of the Bayesian level set estimates in the regression model. We present a simulation study using a special prior in the framework of density level set estimation. This allows us to visualise the numerical performances of the Bayesian estimate and to compare them to a plug-in level set estimate.","Bayesian nonparametric estimation,consistency,level sets,reversible jump MCMC,spatial point process,Voronoi tessellation","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,POISSON INTENSITY,DENSITY CONTOUR,CONVERGENCE,CLUSTERS,RATES","Gayraud, Ghislaine@INSEE, CREST, LS, F-92241 Malakoff, France@Univ Rouen, LMRS, UMR CNRS 6085, Rouen, France@Univ Paris 09, Paris, France::Rousseau, Judith@INSEE, CREST, LS, F-92241 Malakoff, France@Univ Rouen, LMRS, UMR CNRS 6085, Rouen, France@Univ Paris 09, Paris, France","Gayraud, Ghislaine@Unknow@University of Rouen@University of Paris Dauphine@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)::Rousseau, Judith@Unknow@University of Rouen@University of Paris Dauphine@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)",not exist,"Hn algorithm for nonparametric Bayesian estimation of a Poisson intensity+Arjas, E; Heikkinen, J+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+1997::NONPARAMETRIC BAYESIAN-INFERENCE FROM RIGHT CENSORED SURVIVAL-DATA, USING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+ARJAS, E; GASBARRA, D+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1994::Convergence rates in nonparametric estimation of level sets+Baillo, A; Cuesta-Albertos, JA; Cuevas, A+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 15 2001::The consistency of posterior distributions in nonparametric problems+Barron, A; Schervish, MJ; Wasserman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::Bayesian estimation and segmentation of spatial point processes using Voronoi tilings+Byers, SD; Raftery, AE.+Spatial cluster modelling+2002::Estimating the number of clusters+Cuevas, A; Febrero, M; Fraiman, R+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 2000::Automatic Bayesian curve fitting+Denison, DGT; Mallick, BK; Smith, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::ON THE CONSISTENCY OF BAYES ESTIMATES+DIACONIS, P; FREEDMAN, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1986::no title+GAYRAUD G+200203 CREST+2002::Rates of convergence for a Bayesian level set estimation+Gayraud, G; Rousseau, J+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2005::Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo computation and Bayesian model determination+Green, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::ESTIMATION OF A CONVEX DENSITY CONTOUR IN 2 DIMENSIONS+HARTIGAN, JA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::Modeling a poisson forest in variable elevations: A nonparametric Bayesian approach+Heikkinen, J; Arjas, E+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1999::no title+HEIKKINEN J+PRACTICAL NONPARAMET+1998::Non-parametric Bayesian estimation of a spatial Poisson intensity+Heikkinen, J; Arjas, E+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 1998::no title+MULLER DW+AM SERIES MATH MANAG+1991::EXCESS MASS ESTIMATES AND TESTS FOR MULTIMODALITY+MULLER, DW; SAWITZKI, G+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1991::Bayesian image analysis with Markov chain Monte Carlo and coloured continuum triangulation models+Nicholls, GK+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::THE EXCESS-MASS ELLIPSOID+NOLAN, D+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+NOV 1991::MEASURING MASS CONCENTRATIONS AND ESTIMATING DENSITY CONTOUR CLUSTERS - AN EXCESS MASS APPROACH+POLONIK, W+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1995::Estimating efficiencies from frontier models with panel data: a comparison of parametric, non- parametric and semipara- metric methods with bootstrapping+Simar, L.+J Prod Anal+1992::On nonparametric estimation of density level sets+Tsybakov, AB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1997::Granulometric smoothing+Walther, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1997"
Second-order properties of regeneration-based bootstrap for atomic Markov chains,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0004-z,MAY 2007,25,6,"In this paper, we show how the original bootstrap method introduced by Datta and McCormick (Can J Stat 21(2):181-193, 1993b), namely the regeneration-based bootstrap, for approximating the sampling distribution of sample mean statistics in the atomic Markovian setting can be modified to get the second-order accuracy. We prove that the drawback of the original construction mainly relies on an inaccurate estimation of the skewness of the sampling distribution by the bootstrap distribution and that it is possible to correct it by standardizing the regeneration-based bootstrap statistic by the length of the bootstrap series instead of the length of the sample and recentering the bootstrap distribution. An asymptotic result establishing the second-order accuracy of this bootstrap estimate up to 0(n(-1) log(n)) (close to the rate obtained in the i.i.d. setting) is also stated under weak moment assumptions.","bootstrap,Markov chains,edgeworth expansion,regeneration,atom","EDGEWORTH EXPANSION,STORAGE PROCESSES,STATISTICS,FUNCTIONALS","Bertail, Patrice@CREST, Lab Stat, F-75014 Paris 14, France@Univ Paris 10, MODAL X, Nanterre, France@LPMA, UMR CNRS 7599, Paris, France@Univ Paris 06, Paris, France@Univ Paris 07, Paris, France::Clemencon, Stephan@CREST, Lab Stat, F-75014 Paris 14, France@Univ Paris 10, MODAL X, Nanterre, France@LPMA, UMR CNRS 7599, Paris, France@Univ Paris 06, Paris, France@Univ Paris 07, Paris, France","Bertail, Patrice@Unknow@Universite Paris Nanterre@Unknow@Sorbonne Universite@Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite-USPC (ComUE)@University of Paris Diderot::Clemencon, Stephan@Unknow@Universite Paris Nanterre@Unknow@Sorbonne Universite@Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite-USPC (ComUE)@University of Paris Diderot",not exist,"no title+Asmussen, S.+Applied Probability and Queues+1987::no title+ATHREYA KB+897 I STAT SCI AC SI+1989::EDGEWORTH EXPANSION OF A FUNCTION OF SAMPLE MEANS+BAI, ZD; RAO, CR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1991::The Weighted Bootstrap+Barbe, P.; Bertail, P.+LECT NOTES STAT+1995::Edgeworth expansions of suitably normalized sample mean statistics for atomic Markov chains+Bertail, P; Clemencon, S+PROBABILITY THEORY AND RELATED FIELDS+NOV 2004::THE EDGEWORTH EXPANSION FOR U-STATISTICS OF DEGREE-2+BICKEL, PJ; GOTZE, F; VANZWET, WR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1986::THE BERRY-ESSEEN THEOREM FOR STRONGLY MIXING HARRIS RECURRENT MARKOV-CHAINS+BOLTHAUSEN, E+ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WAHRSCHEINLICHKEITSTHEORIE UND VERWANDTE GEBIETE+1982::STORAGE PROCESSES WITH GENERAL RELEASE RULE AND ADDITIVE INPUTS+BROCKWELL, PJ; RESNICK, SI; TWEEDIE, RL+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+1982::WORK-MODULATED QUEUES WITH APPLICATIONS TO STORAGE PROCESSES+BROWNE, S; SIGMAN, K+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+SEP 1992::An asymptotic expansion for the distribution of a statistic admitting an asymptotic expansion+Chibisov, D.M.+Theory of Probability and Its Applications+Dec. 1972::Moment and probability inequalities for sums of bounded additive functionals of regular Markov chains via the Nummelin splitting technique+Clemencon, SJM+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+DEC 1 2001::REGENERATION-BASED BOOTSTRAP FOR MARKOV-CHAINS+DATTA, S; MCCORMICK, WP+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 1993::ON THE 1ST-ORDER EDGEWORTH EXPANSION FOR A MARKOV-CHAIN+DATTA, S; MCCORMICK, WP+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+FEB 1993::Second-order correctness of the blockwise bootstrap for stationary observations+Gotze, F; Kunsch, HR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 1996::ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS FOR BIVARIATE VON MISES FUNCTIONALS+GOTZE, F+ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WAHRSCHEINLICHKEITSTHEORIE UND VERWANDTE GEBIETE+1979::The stationary distribution and first exit probabilities of a storage process with general release rule+Harrison, J.M.; Resnick, S.I.+Mathematics of Operations Research+Nov. 1976::no title+Lahiri,, S.+Resampling Methods for Dependent Data+2003::EDGEWORTH EXPANSIONS FOR SYMMETRICAL STATISTICS WITH APPLICATIONS TO BOOTSTRAP METHODS+LAI, TL; WANG, JQZ+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1993::On Some Asymptotic Relations and Identities for Harris Recurrent Markov Chains+Malinovskii, V.

Bootstrap tests for nonparametric comparison of regression curves with dependent errors,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0005-y,MAY 2007,28,10,"In this paper, the problem of testing the equality of regression curves with dependent data is studied. Several methods based on nonparametric estimators of the regression function are described. In this setting, the distribution of the test statistic is frequently unknown or difficult to compute, so an approximate test based on the asymptotic distribution of the statistic can be considered. Nevertheless, the asymptotic properties of the methods proposed in this work have been obtained under independence of the observations, and just one of these methods was studied in a context of dependence as reported by Vilar-Fernandez and Gonzalez-Manteiga (Statistics 58(2):81-99, 2003). In addition, the distribution of these test statistics converges to the limit distribution with convergence rates usually rather slow, so that the approximations obtained for reasonable sample sizes are not satisfactory. For these reasons, many authors have suggested the use of bootstrap algorithms as an alternative approach. Our main concern is to compare the behavior of three bootstrap procedures that take into account the dependence assumption of the observations when they are used to approximate the distribution of the test statistics considered. A broad simulation study is carried out to observe the finite sample performance of the analyzed bootstrap tests.","hypothesis testing,regression models,nonparametric estimators,dependent data","POWER OPTIMALITY,TIME-SERIES,EQUALITY,COVARIANCE,DIFFERENCE,SELECTION","Vilar-Fernandez, J.

Change-point diagnostics in competing risks models: Two posterior predictive p-value approaches,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0006-x,MAY 2007,18,0,"This paper presents a Bayesian diagnostic procedure for examining change-point assumption in the competing risks model framework. It considers the family of distributions arising from the cause-specific model as reported by Chiang (Introduction to stochastic processes in biostatistics. Wiley, New York, 1968) upon which change-points are added to accommodate possible distributional heterogeneity. Model departure, due to misspecification of change-points associated with either the overall survival distribution or cause-specific probabilities, is quantified in terms of a sequence of cumulative-sum statistics between each pair of adjacent change-points assumed. When assessing the asymptotic behavior of each sequence of cumulative-sum statistics using its posterior predictive p-values, see Rubin (Ann Stat 12:1151-1172, 1984) and partial posterior predictive p-values as reported by Bayarri and Berger (J Am Stat Assoc 95:1127-1142, 2000), we show that both types of p-values attain their greatest departure from 0.5 at the change-point that is missed in the assumed model, from which a diagnostic procedure is formalized. Statistical power of these two types of p-values is discussed.","change-point,competing risks,posterior predictive p-values","INFERENCE,VARIABLES,SEQUENCE,TESTS","Wang, Chen-Pin@Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, San Antonio, TX 78285 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Ghosh, Malay@Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, San Antonio, TX 78285 USA@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Wang, Chen-Pin@University of Texas Health San Antonio@University of Texas System@University of Florida@State University System of Florida::Ghosh, Malay@University of Texas Health San Antonio@University of Texas System@University of Florida@State University System of Florida",not exist,"no title+Denison, D; Holmes, C; Malick, B<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Smith, A</span>.+Bayesian methods for nonlinear classification and regression+2002::no title+GELMAN A+APPL STAT SCI BAYESI+1996::Posterior predictive assessment of model fitness via realized discrepancies+Gelman, A; Meng, XL; Stern, H+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 1996::A state-space model for National Football League scores+Glickman, ME; Stern, HS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1998::USE OF CONCEPT OF A FUTURE OBSERVATION IN GOODNESS-OF-FIT PROBLEMS+GUTTMAN, I+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1967::INFERENCE ABOUT CHANGE-POINT FROM CUMULATIVE SUM TESTS+HINKLEY, DV+BIOMETRIKA+1971::INFERENCE ABOUT CHANGE-POINT IN A SEQUENCE OF BINOMIAL VARIABLES+HINKLEY, DV; HINKLEY, EA+BIOMETRIKA+1970::TESTS FOR A CHANGE-POINT+JAMES, B; JAMES, KL+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1987::POSTERIOR PREDICTIVE P-VALUES+MENG, XL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1994::A TEST FOR A CHANGE IN A PARAMETER OCCURRING AT AN UNKNOWN POINT+PAGE, ES+BIOMETRIKA+1955::A SIMPLE CUMULATIVE SUM TYPE STATISTIC FOR THE CHANGE-POINT PROBLEM WITH ZERO-ONE OBSERVATIONS+PETTITT, AN+BIOMETRIKA+1980::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF A POISSON-PROCESS WITH A CHANGE-POINT+RAFTERY, AE; AKMAN, VE+BIOMETRIKA+APR 1986::no title+Robert, C.+The Bayesian Choice: A Decision -Theoretic Motivation+1994::Asymptotic distribution of P values in composite null models+Robins, JM; van der Vaart, A; Ventura, V+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::BAYESIANLY JUSTIFIABLE AND RELEVANT FREQUENCY CALCULATIONS FOR THE APPLIED STATISTICIAN+RUBIN, DB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1984::BAYESIAN APPROACH TO INFERENCE ABOUT A CHANGE-POINT IN A SEQUENCE OF RANDOM-VARIABLES+SMITH, AFM+BIOMETRIKA+1975::no title+STEPHENS DA+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1994::NONIDENTIFIABILITY ASPECT OF PROBLEM OF COMPETING RISKS+TSIATIS, A+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+1975"

A note on inclusion probability in ranked set sampling and some of its variations,TEST,10.1007/s11749-006-0009-7,MAY 2007,20,13,Inclusion probabilities are design dependent and should be furnished with the design elements. Inclusion probability of an element in the population is the probability that the element will be chosen in a sample. In this paper the inclusion probabilities in the case of ranked set sampling design and some of its variations are furnished.

Regularization in statistics,TEST,10.1007/BF02607055,DEC 2006,89,75,"This paper is a selective review of the regularization methods scattered in statistics literature. We introduce a general conceptual approach to regularization and fit most existing methods into it. We have tried to focus on the importance of regularization when dealing with today's high-dimensional objects: data and models. A wide range of examples are discussed, including nonparametric regression, boosting, covariance matrix estimation, principal component estimation, subsampling.","regularization,linear regression,nonparametric regression,boosting,covariance matrix,principal component,bootstrap,subsampling,model selection","GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION,NONCONCAVE PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD,VARIABLE SELECTION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,COVARIANCE MATRICES,MODEL SELECTION,ASYMPTOTIC OPTIMALITY,PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,RIDGE-REGRESSION,DENSITY-FUNCTION","Bickel, Peter J.@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China::Li, Bo@Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA@Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Bickel, Peter J.@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@Tsinghua University::Li, Bo@University of California System@University of California Berkeley@Tsinghua University",not exist,"STATISTICAL PREDICTOR IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+1970::Prediction by supervised principal components+Bair, E; Hastie, T; Paul, D; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2006::no title+BICKEL PJ+716 U CAL DEP STAT+2006::Some theory for Fisher's linear discriminant function, 'naive Bayes', and some alternatives when there are many more variables than observations+Bickel, PJ; Levina, E+BERNOULLI+DEC 2004::no title+BICKEL PJ+IN PRESS J MACHINE L+2006::Resampling fewer than n observations: Gains, losses, and remedies for losses+Bickel, PJ; Gotze, F; vanZwet, WR+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1997::no title+BICKEL PJ+UNPUB CHOICE M M OUT+2005::no title+BICKELI PJ+EFFICIENT ADAPTIVE E+1993::Gaussian model selection+Birge, L; Massart, P.+J Eur Math Soc+2001::From model selection to adaptive estimation+Birge, L; Massart, P.+FESTSCHRIFT LUCIEN C+1997::no title+Bottcher, A.; Silbermann, B.+Introduction To Large Truncated Toeplitz Matrices (Universitext)+1999::Heuristics of instability and stabilization in model selection+Breiman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1996::Robust confidence bounds for extreme upper quantiles+BREIMAN, L.; STONE, C.

We derive expressions for the nth moment, moment generating function, characteristic function, mean deviation about the mean, mean deviation about the median, Renyi entropy, Shannon entropy and the asymptotic distribution of the extreme order statistics.

Bias reduction in risk modelling: Semi-parametric quantile estimation,TEST,10.1007/BF02607058,DEC 2006,19,17,"In Statistics of Extremes we are mainly interested in the estimation of quantities related to extreme events. In many areas of application, like for instance Insurance Mathematics, Finance and Statistical Quality Control, a typical requirement is to find a value, high enough, so that the chance of an exceedance of that value is small. We are then interested in the estimation of a high quantile chi(p), a value which is overpassed with a small probability p. In this paper we deal with the semi-parametric estimation of chi(p) for heavy tails. Since the classical semi-parametric estimators exhibit a reasonably high bias for low thresholds, we shall deal with bias reduction techniques, trying to improve their performance.","heavy tails,high quantiles,semi-parametric estimation,bias reduction,statistics of extremes","INDEX,TAIL,PARAMETERS","Gomes, M.

Comparison of designs in presence of a possible correlation in observations,TEST,10.1007/BF02607063,DEC 2006,12,3,"We often assume the standard linear model with uncorrelated observations for comparison of designs without realizing a possible presence of correlation in observations. In this paper we present several change of variance functions including the one given in Zhou (2001) for comparing designs in presence of possible correlation in observations. We find a design by minimizing one of our proposed change of variance functions in a simple response surface setup. We then compare its performance with all variance design, all bias design, and the design making the average variance equal to the average squared bias. We also compare a second order rotatable design with a non-rotatable design. The rotatable design is better than the non-rotatable design with respect to A-, D-, and E- optimality criterion functions under the standard linear model with uncorrelated observations. We observe that the rotatable design may not perform better than the non-rotatable design with respect to the change of variance functions. We present some important properties of the change of variance functions.

The random intrinsic fast initial response of two-sided CUSUM charts,TEST,10.1007/BF02607064,DEC 2006,23,3,"A two-sided cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart may be defined as a joint plot of the successive values of a pair of upper and lower one-sided cumulative sum statistics. The standard procedure used to initialize these statistics consists in assigning a fixed starting value to each one of them. Each starting value may be taken equal to either zero or a fixed constant chosen to provide a fast initial response to the chart. In this article, the performance of a two-sided CUSUM chart is analyzed assuming that the pair of upper and lower one-sided statistics is initialized at a random point which follows a suitable defined joint stable distribution for the chart. This policy may be called the random intrinsic fast initial response (RIFIR) starting policy for the two-sided CUSUM chart. The article provides an algorithm to compute the stable distribution corresponding to the RIFIR starting policy as well as methods to evaluate the run-length distributions for in-control and out-of control situations. An important consequence of the stability of the RIFIR starting distribution is that, if no level shifts and no false alarms have occurred for a sufficiently large time interval (0, tau), the CUSUM chart behaves after tau as if the RIFIR initialization was used at tau, no matter how the chart was initialized at 0.","average run length,cumulative sum charts,Gaussian quadrature,Markov chains,run-length distribution,statistical process control","LENGTH PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTION,RUN-LENGTH,CONTROL SCHEMES,DISTRIBUTIONS","Luceno, Alberto@Univ Cantabria, ETS Ingn Caminos, Dept Appl Math & Computat Sci, E-39005 Santander, Spain::Cofino, Antonio S.@Univ Cantabria, ETS Ingn Caminos, Dept Appl Math & Computat Sci, E-39005 Santander, Spain","Luceno, Alberto@Universidad de Cantabria::Cofino, Antonio S.@Universidad de Cantabria","Luceno, Alberto@M-3111-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5346-0359::Cofino, Antonio@G-6247-2010::Meteorology Group, Santander@A-3667-2016","CONTROL CHARTS AND STOCHASTIC-PROCESSES+BARNARD, GA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1959::no title+Box, G.P; Luceno, A.+Statistical Control by Monitoring and Feedback Adjustment+1997::APPROACH TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF CUSUM RUN LENGTH+BROOK, D; EVANS, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::SAMPLING INSPECTION OF CONTINUOUS PROCESSES WITH NO AUTOCORRELATION BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE RESULTS+EWAN, WD; KEMP, KW+BIOMETRIKA+1960::THE RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTION OF A CUMULATIVE SUM CONTROL CHART+GAN, FF+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1993::DETERMINATION OF ARL AND A CONTOUR NOMOGRAM FOR CUSUM CHARTS TO CONTROL NORMAL MEAN+GOEL, AL; WU, SM+TECHNOMETRICS+1971::no title+Hawkins, D.

Mixed model prediction and small area estimation,TEST,10.1007/BF02595419,JUN 2006,164,120,"Over the last three decades, mixed models have been frequently used in a wide range of small area applications. Such models offer great flexibilities in combining information from various sources, and thus are well suited for solving most small area estimation problems. The present article reviews major research developments in the classical inferential approach for linear and generalized linear mixed models that are relevant to different issues concerning small area estimation and related problems.","benchmarking,borrowing strength,design-consistency,mean squared errors,empirical Bayes,EBLUP,generalized linear mixed models,higher order asymptotics,resampling methods,sample surveys,variance components","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATION,MEAN SQUARED ERROR,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES,UNBIASED PREDICTORS,LIKELIHOOD APPROACH,ROBUST ESTIMATION,STANDARD ERRORS","Jiang, JM@Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Davis, CA 95616 USA@Univ Maryland, Joint Program Survey Methodol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA::Lahiri, P@Univ Calif Davis, Dept Stat, Davis, CA 95616 USA@Univ Maryland, Joint Program Survey Methodol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Jiang, JM@University of California Davis@University of California System@University of Maryland College Park@University System of Maryland::Lahiri, P@University of California Davis@University of California System@University of Maryland College Park@University System of Maryland",not exist,"Empirical Bayes estimation of finite population means from complex surveys+Arora, V; Lahiri, P; Mukherjee, K+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::ON A FORMULA FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O+BIOMETRIKA+1983::Empirical Bayes prediction intervals in a normal regression model: higher order asymptotics+Basu, R; Ghosh, JK; Mukerjee, R+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 15 2003::AN ERROR-COMPONENTS MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF COUNTY CROP AREAS USING SURVEY AND SATELLITE DATA+BATTESE, GE; HARTER, RM; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1988::DIAGNOSTICS FOR MIXED-MODEL ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE+BECKMAN, RJ; NACHTSHEIM, CJ; COOK, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::Discussion with jackknife in the Fay-Herriott model with an example+Bell, W.+Proceeding of the Seminar on Funding Opportunity in Survey Research+2001::Standard errors of prediction in generalized linear mixed models+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1998::Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Booth, JG; Hobert, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::Small area data: policy issues and technical challenges+Brackstone, G.J.+Small Area Statistics+1987::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::On measures of uncertainty of empirical Bayes small-area estimators+Butar, FB; Lahiri, P+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1 2003::no title+BUTAR FB+THESIS U NEBRASKA LI+1997::BAYESIAN AND FREQUENTIST PREDICTIVE INFERENCE FOR THE PATTERNS OF CARE STUDIES+CALVIN, JA; SEDRANSK, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1991::no title+Carlin, B; Louis, T.+Bayes and empirical Bayes methods for data analysis+1996::APPROACHES FOR EMPIRICAL BAYES CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+CARLIN, BP; GELFAND, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1990::A SAMPLE REUSE METHOD FOR ACCURATE PARAMETRIC EMPIRICAL BAYES CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS+CARLIN, BP; GELFAND, AE+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::EMPIRICAL BAYES METHODS APPLIED TO ESTIMATING FIRE ALARM PROBABILITIES+CARTER, GM; ROLPH, JE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::no title+CHATTERJEE S+UNPUB PARAMETRIC BOO+2002::no title+CHAUDHURI A+STAT NEERL+1994::no title+CHEN S+IN PRESS P SURV RES+2005::no title+CHEN S+P SURVEY RES METHODS+1993::no title+CHEN S+UNPUB JACKKNIFING ME+2003::no title+CHEN S+UNPUB MEAN SQUARE PR+2005::On mean squared prediction error estimation in small area estimation problems+Chen, S.; Lahiri, P.+P SURV RES METH SECT+2002::CASE-DELETION DIAGNOSTICS FOR MIXED MODELS+CHRISTENSEN, R; PEARSON, LM; JOHNSON, W+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1992::no title+CHRISTIANSEN CL+BAYESIAN BIOSTATISTI+1996::Hierarchical Poisson regression modeling+Christiansen, CL; Morris, CN+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::no title+CHRISTIANSEN CL+README DOCUMENT JUNE+1994::no title+CITRO CF+SMALL AREA ESTIMATES+1997::Prediction intervals and empirical bayes confidence intervals+Cox, D.

Bootstrapping cointegration tests under structural co-breaks: A robust extended ECM test,TEST,10.1007/BF02595424,JUN 2006,24,0,"The aim of the paper is the analysis of ECM (Error Correction Model) bootstrap cointegration tests under structural breaks. Classical ECM tests depend on some nuisance parameters, which is an undesirable feature for empirical applications. This problem is overcome by using the bootstrap ECM test, which shows good size and power properties when there are no breaks. In this paper we study the small sample properties of alternative bootstrap ECM tests under different co-breaking situations. ECM test statistics are made robust to partial co-breaking by using extended error correction models or by imposing a common factor restriction.","bootstrap,structural breaks,cointegration testing,extended error correction model,co-breaks","VECTOR,POWER","Arranz, MA@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid 28903, Spain@Bayes Forecast, Madrid, Spain@Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA::Escribano, A@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid 28903, Spain@Bayes Forecast, Madrid, Spain@Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA","Arranz, MA@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid@Unknow@Georgetown University::Escribano, A@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid@Unknow@Georgetown University",not exist,"no title+ARRANZ M+COMFAC RESTRICTION E+2000::no title+ARRANZ M+OXFORD B ECON STAT+2000::Recent developments in bootstrapping time series+Berkowitz, J.; Kilian, L.+Econ.

Postgrouped sampling method of estimation,TEST,NO DOI,JUN 2006,10,3,"A postgrouped sampling is considered for estimating the (finite or infinite) population mean. Double sampling and an empirical-weighted estimator is used. Unbiasedness, variance and efficiency are considered. Its properties are discussed allowing the simple random sampling with replacement (SRSWR) design in the first phase, and in each stratum for the second phase. It is shown that for a fixed sample size in each postgroup, the variance of the proposed estimator with less prior information is asymptotically equivalent to the usual stratified estimator for fixed allocation. Some examples axe provided for natural populations. The method is also extended to simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR) design in the first phase, and in each stratum for the second phase.

Intrinsic credible regions: An objective Bayesian approach to interval estimation,TEST,10.1007/BF02595408,DEC 2005,0,29,"This paper defines intrinsic credible regions, a method to produce objective Bayesian credible regions which only depends on the assumed model and the available data. Lowest posterior loss (LPL) regions are defined as Bayesian credible regions which contain values of minimum posterior expected loss; they depend both on the loss function and on the prior specification. An invariant, information-theory based loss function, the intrinsic discrepancy, is argued to be appropriate for scientific communication. Intrinsic credible regions are the lowest posterior loss regions with respect to the intrinsic discrepancy loss and the appropriate reference prior. The proposed procedure is completely general, and it is invariant under both reparametrization and marginalization. The exact derivation of intrinsic credible regions often requires numerical integration, but good analytical approximations are provided. Special attention is given to one-dimensional intrinsic credible intervals; their coverage properties show that they are always approximate (and sometimes exact) frequentist confidence intervals. The method is illustrated with a number of examples.","amount of information,intrinsic discrepancy,Bayesian asymptotics,confidence intervals,Fisher information,HPD regions,interval estimation,Jeffreys priors,LPL regions,objective priors,reference priors,point estimation,probability centred intervals,region estimation",,"Bernardo, JM@Univ Valencia, Dept Estadist & IO, Valencia, Spain","Bernardo, JM@University of Valencia","Robert, Christian@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6635-3261::Bernardo, Jose M@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3825-9328",

Semiparametric censorship model with covariates,TEST,10.1007/BF02595415,DEC 2005,21,6,"In real applications, we may be confronted with the problem of informative censoring. Koziol-Green model is commonly used to model the possible information contained in the informative censoring. However the proportionality assumption cast by Koziol-Green model (see (1.2) below) is ""too restrictive in that it limits the scope of the Cox model in practice"" (see Subramanian, 2000). In this paper, we try to relax the proportionality condition of Koziol-Green model by modeling the censorship semiparametrically. It is shown that our suggested semiparametric censoring model is an applicable extension of the Koziol-Green model. Through a close connection with the logistic regression, our model assumptions are readily to be checked in practice. We also propose estimation for both the regression paxameter and the cumulative baseline hazard function which can incorporate the additional information contained in the serniparametric censorship model.

The finite sample behavior of the tests is examined by means of a simulation study. Finally, the tests under discussion are applied to two data sets, and we discuss the applicability of the tests under random censorship.","M-class,LM-class,moment generating function order,exponential distribution,goodness-of-fit test,local approximate Bahadur efficiency","LAPLACE ORDER DOMINANCE,RANDOM CENSORSHIP","Klar, B@Univ Karlsruhe, Inst Math Stochast, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany","Klar, B@Karlsruhe Institute of Technology@Helmholtz Association","Klar, Bernhard@K-4602-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1419-5473","no title+ALY EEA+STAT DECISIONS+1992::Testing exponentiality against Laplace order dominance+Basu, SK; Mitra, M+STATISTICS+SEP 2002::Testing exponentiality against L-distributions+Chaudhuri, G+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 15 1997::TESTING FOR EXPONENTIAL AND MARSHALL OLKIN DISTRIBUTIONS+CSORGO, S; WELSH, AH+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 1989::Tests for exponentiality+Doksum, K.

The analysis of ordered categorical data: An overview and a survey of recent developments,TEST,10.1007/BF02595397,JUN 2005,0,97,"This article reviews methodologies used for analyzing ordered categorical (ordinal) response variables. We begin by surveying models for data with a single ordinal response variable. We also survey recently proposed strategies for modeling ordinal response variables when the data have some type of clustering or when repeated measurement occurs at various occasions for each subject, such as in longitudinal studies. Primary models in that case include marginal models and cluster-specific (conditional) models for which effects apply conditionally at the cluster level. Related discussion refers to multi-level and transitional models. The main emphasis is on maximum likelihood inference, although we indicate certain models (e.g., marginal models, multi-level models) for which this can be computationally difficult. The Bayesian approach has also received considerable attention for categorical data in the past decade, and we survey recent Bayesian approaches to modeling ordinal response variables. Alternative, non-model-based, approaches are also available for certain types of inference.","association model,Bayesian inference,cumulative logit,generalized estimating equations,generalized linear mixed model,inequality constraints,marginal model,multi-level model,ordinal data,proportional odds",,"Liu, I@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ Victoria, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Wellington, New Zealand::Agresti, A@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ Victoria, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Wellington, New Zealand","Liu, I@State University System of Florida@University of Florida@Victoria University Wellington::Agresti, A@State University System of Florida@University of Florida@Victoria University Wellington","Aguilera, Ana M.@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2425-6716::Liu, Ivy@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3152-2632",

On the validity condition of the chi-squared test in 2 x 2 tables,TEST,10.1007/BF02595399,JUN 2005,29,3,"A 2 x 2 contingency table is usually analyzed by using the chi-squaxed asymptotic test, with Yates' continuity correction (c = n/2, where n is the total size of sample). This correction is the correct one when the chi-squared test is an approximation to Fisher's exact (conditional) test. When the chi-squared test is used as an approximation to Barnard's exact (unconditional) test for comparing two independent proportions (two samples of size n(1). and n(2)), or for contrasting independence (one sample with a size of n), the correction c is different (c = 1 if n(1) not equal n(2) or c = 2 if n(1) = n(2) in the first case; c = 0.5 in the second). Whatever the case, it is traditional to affirm that the asymptotic test is valid when E > 5, where E is the minimum expected quantity. Today it is recognized that this condition is too general and may not be appropriate. In the case of Yates' correction, Martin Andres and Herranz Tejedor (2000) proved that the validity condition must be of the type E > E* -where E* is a known function depending on the marginals of the table- and that checking the validity of the asymptotic test is equivalent to checking the asymmetry of the base statistic (a hypergeometric random variable). In the present article the authors prove that this argument is valid for the other two continuity corrections, and moreover, that the value E* is obtained for all three cases. Given that the function E* reaches an absolute maximum, it can be affirmed that the three chi-squared tests referred to are valid when E > 19.2, 14.9 or 6.2 (or E > 8.1, 7.7 or 3.9 if n <= 500) respectively for the three previous models (although for the first model and the two-tailed test E > 0 is sufficient).","asymmetry,Barnard's exact test,chi-squared test,conditional test,continuity correction,Fisher's exact test,minimum expected quantity,unconditional test,validity conditions,2 x 2 tables","YATES CONTINUITY CORRECTION,FISHERS EXACT TEST,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,MULTINOMIAL TRIALS,REASONS","Andres, AM@Univ Granada, Fac Med, E-18071 Granada, Spain@Univ Cadiz, Estadist & IO, Cadiz, Spain::Quevedo, MJS@Univ Granada, Fac Med, E-18071 Granada, Spain@Univ Cadiz, Estadist & IO, Cadiz, Spain::Garcia, JMT@Univ Granada, Fac Med, E-18071 Granada, Spain@Univ Cadiz, Estadist & IO, Cadiz, Spain::Silva-Mato, A@Univ Granada, Fac Med, E-18071 Granada, Spain@Univ Cadiz, Estadist & IO, Cadiz, Spain","Andres, AM@University of Granada@Universidad de Cadiz::Quevedo, MJS@University of Granada@Universidad de Cadiz::Garcia, JMT@University of Granada@Universidad de Cadiz::Silva-Mato, A@University of Granada@Universidad de Cadiz","Martin Andres, Antonio@K-4309-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2548-2638::Tapia Garcia, Juan Miguel@F-2309-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1862-5469","On conditions for validity of the approximations to Fisher's exact test+Andres, AM; Tejedor, IH+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1997::Optimal unconditional asymptotic test in 2x2 multinomial trials+Andres, AM; Garcia, JMT+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2004::OPTIMAL CORRECTION FOR CONTINUITY IN THE CHI-SQUARED TEST IN 2X2 TABLES (CONDITIONED METHOD)+ANDRES, AM; TEJEDOR, IH; DELCASTILLO, JDL+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1992::A REVIEW OF CLASSIC NONASYMPTOTIC METHODS FOR COMPARING 2 PROPORTIONS BY MEANS OF INDEPENDENT SAMPLES+ANDRES, AM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1991::Asymptotical tests in 2 x 2 comparative trials (unconditional approach)+Andres, AM; Quevedo, MJS; Mato, AS+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 28 2002::Optimal unconditional test in 2x2 multinomial trials+Andres, AM; Garcia, JMT+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 28 1999::Fisher's mid-P-value arrangement in 2x2 comparative trials+Andres, AM; Quevedo, MJS; Mato, AS+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 28 1998::Optimal correction for continuity and conditions for validity in the unconditional chi-squared test+Andres, AM; Mato, AS+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 1 1996::IS FISHERS EXACT TEST VERY CONSERVATIVE+ANDRES, AM; TEJEDOR, IH+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 1995::On the minimum expected quantity for the validity of the chi-squared test in 2 X 2 tables+Andres, AM; Tejedor, IH+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+SEP 2000::no title+ANDRES M+COMPUTATIONAL STAT D+1997::SIGNIFICANCE TESTS FOR 2X2 TABLES+BARNARD, GA+BIOMETRIKA+1947::TESTING FOR ASSOCIATION IN 2X2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES WITH VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZES+CAMILLI, G; HOPKINS, KD+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1979::APPLICABILITY OF CHI-SQUARE TO 2X2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES WITH SMALL EXPECTED CELL FREQUENCIES+CAMILLI, G; HOPKINS, KD+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1978::SOME METHODS FOR STRENGTHENING THE COMMON X2 TESTS+COCHRAN, WG+BIOMETRICS+1954::SOME REASONS FOR NOT USING YATES CONTINUITY CORRECTION ON 2X2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES+CONOVER, WJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::no title+Fisher, R.

On convergence of Fisher informations in continuous models with quantized observations,TEST,10.1007/BF02595401,JUN 2005,9,0,"Continuous location models with real observations and well defined Fisher information are considered and reduction of the Fisher information due to quantizations of the observation space into m intervals is studied. In fact, generalized Fisher informations of orders alpha >= 1 are considered where alpha = 2 corresponds to the classical Fisher information. By an example it is argued that in some models the information of order alpha = 2 is infinite while the informations of some orders alpha not equal 2 are finite. Among the studied problems is the existence of optimal quantizations which maximize the reduced information for fixed m and a >= I and the construction of simple and practically applicable quantizations for which the reduction converges to zero when m -> infinity, uniformly for all alpha >= 1. The rate of this convergence is estimated for all alpha >= 1 and directly evaluated for alpha = I and alpha = 2. For special models the reductions are directly evaluated for m = 1, 2.... either analytically or numerically.","location models,Fisher information,generalized Fisher information,finite quantizations,sufficiency,rate of convergence",,"Hobza, T@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, E-28903 Getafe, Madrid, Spain@Czech Tech Univ, Dept Math, CR-16635 Prague, Czech Republic@Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic::Molina, I@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, E-28903 Getafe, Madrid, Spain@Czech Tech Univ, Dept Math, CR-16635 Prague, Czech Republic@Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic::Vajda, I@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, E-28903 Getafe, Madrid, Spain@Czech Tech Univ, Dept Math, CR-16635 Prague, Czech Republic@Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic","Hobza, T@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid@Czech Technical University Prague@Czech Academy of Sciences::Molina, I@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid@Czech Technical University Prague@Czech Academy of Sciences::Vajda, I@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid@Czech Technical University Prague@Czech Academy of Sciences","Vajda, Igor (1942-2010)@K-7478-2013::Molina, Isabel@H-4729-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4424-9540::Hobza, Tomas@A-1691-2016","no title+COVER T+INFORMATION THEORY+1991::no title+FERGUSON TS+COURSE LOGIC SAMPLE+1996::ON THEORY OF FISHERS INFORMATION QUANTITY+KAGAN, AM+DOKLADY AKADEMII NAUK SSSR+1963::On efficiency of estimation and testing with data quantized to fixed number of cells+Mayora, AM; Morales, D; Morales, J; et al.+METRIKA+2003::Two approaches to grouping of data and related disparity statistics+Menendez, M; Morales, D; Pardo, L; et al.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1998::no title+MENENDEZ ML+APPL MATH+2001::On convergence of information contained in quantized observations+Vajda, I+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+AUG 2002::no title+Vajda, I.+Theory of statistical inference and information+1989::ca-divergence and generalized Fisher information+Vajda, I.+T 6 PRAG C INF THEOR+1973"
Objective Bayesian methods for one-sided testing,TEST,10.1007/BF02595402,JUN 2005,28,8,"The one-sided testing problem can be naturally formulated as the comparison between two nonnested models. In an objective Bayesian setting, that is, when subjective prior information is not available, no general method exists either for deriving proper prior distributions on parameters or for computing Bayes factor and model posterior probabilities. The encompassing approach solves this difficulty by converting the problem into a nested model comparison for which standard methods can be applied to derive proper priors.

We argue that the usual way of encompassing does not have a Bayesian justification, and propose a variant of this method that provides an objective Bayesian solution. The solution proposed here is further extended to the case where nuisance parameters are present and where the hypotheses to be tested are separated by an interval. Some illustrative examples are given for regular and non-regular sampling distributions.","Bayes factor,fractional prior,intrinsic prior,nonnested models,one-sided testing","MODEL SELECTION,DEFAULT","Moreno, E@Univ Granada, Dept Stat, Granada 18071, Spain","Moreno, E@University of Granada",not exist,"The intrinsic Bayes factor for linear models ( with discussion)+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR.+Bayesian Statistics+1996::no title+BERGER JO+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+1995::Default Bayes factors for nonnested hypothesis testing+Berger, JO; Mortera, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1999::The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::no title+BERGER JO+MODELING PREDICTION+1909::no title+BERGER JO+SANKYA B+1997::On criticism and comparison of default Bayes factor for model selection and hypothesis testing+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR.+P WORKSH MOD SEL BOL+1998::On the Development of Reference Priors+Bernardo, J.

A smooth simultaneous confidence band for correlation curve,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0543-5,JUN 2018,35,0,"A plug-in estimator is proposed for a local measure of variance explained by regression, termed correlation curve in Doksum et al. (J Am Stat Assoc 89:571-582, 1994), consisting of a two-step spline-kernel estimator of the conditional variance function and local quadratic estimator of first derivative of the mean function. The estimator is oracally efficient in the sense that it is as efficient as an infeasible correlation estimator with the variance function known. As a consequence of the oracle efficiency, a smooth simultaneous confidence band (SCB) is constructed around the proposed correlation curve estimator and shown to be asymptotically correct. Simulated examples illustrate the versatility of the proposed oracle SCB which confirms the asymptotic theory. Application to a 1995 British Family Expenditure Survey data has found marginally significant evidence for a local version of Engel's law, i.e., food budget share and household real income are inversely related (Hamilton in Am Econ Rev 91:619-630, 2001).","Confidence band,Correlation curve,Heteroscedasticity,Infeasible estimator,Local quadratic estimator","ORACALLY EFFICIENT ESTIMATION,SPARSE FUNCTIONAL DATA,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,BIAS,CORRIDOR,DENSITY","Zhang, Yuanyuan@Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China::Yang, Lijian@Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Zhang, Yuanyuan@Tsinghua University::Yang, Lijian@Tsinghua University","Yang, Lijian@E-1848-2011","Local polynomial estimation in multiparameter likelihood models+Aerts, M; Claeskens, G+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::On some global measures of deviations of density function estimates+Bickel, PJ; Rosenblatt, M.+Ann Stat+1973::Semi-nonparametric IV estimation of shape-invariant Engel curves+Blundell, Richard; Chen, Xiaohong; Kristensen, Dennis+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2007::A smooth simultaneous confidence band for conditional variance function+Cai, Li; Yang, Lijian+TEST+SEP 2015::Simultaneous inference for the mean function based on dense functional data+Cao, Guanqun; Yang, Lijian; Todem, David+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+2012::ORACLE-EFFICIENT CONFIDENCE ENVELOPES FOR COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS IN DENSE FUNCTIONAL DATA+Cao, Guanqun; Wang, Li; Li, Yehua; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2016::ROBUST LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION AND SMOOTHING SCATTERPLOTS+CLEVELAND, WS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::no title+De Boor, C.+A practical guide to splines+2001::CORRELATION CURVES AS LOCAL MEASURES OF VARIANCE EXPLAINED BY REGRESSION+DOKSUM, K; BLYTH, S; BRADLOW, E; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1994::CONFIDENCE BANDS IN NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION+EUBANK, RL; SPECKMAN, PL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1993::LOCAL LINEAR-REGRESSION SMOOTHERS AND THEIR MINIMAX EFFICIENCIES+FAN, JQ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1993::ESTIMATING REGRESSION-FUNCTIONS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES BY THE KERNEL-METHOD+GASSER, T; MULLER, HG+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1984::Oracally efficient estimation for single-index link function with simultaneous confidence band+Gu, Lijie; Yang, Lijian+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2015::A simultaneous confidence corridor for varying coefficient regression with sparse functional data+Gu, Lijie; Wang, Li; Haerdle, Wolfgang K.; et al.+TEST+DEC 2014::EFFECT OF BIAS ESTIMATION ON COVERAGE ACCURACY OF BOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR A PROBABILITY DENSITY+HALL, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1992::ON CONFIDENCE BANDS IN NONPARAMETRIC DENSITY-ESTIMATION AND REGRESSION+HALL, P; TITTERINGTON, DM+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 1988::Edgeworth expansions for nonparametric density estimators, with applications+Hall, P.+Statistics+1991::Using Engel's law to estimate CPI bias+Hamilton, BW+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2001::ASYMPTOTIC MAXIMAL DEVIATION OF M-SMOOTHERS+HARDLE, W+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAY 1989::no title+Leadbetter, M.

Small area estimation of poverty proportions under unit-level temporal binomial-logit mixed models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0545-3,JUN 2018,32,0,"Poverty proportions are averages of dichotomic variables that can be explained by unit-level binomial-logit mixed models. The change between the poverty proportions of two consecutive years is an indicator describing the evolution of poverty. This paper applies a unit-level temporal binomial-logit mixed model for estimating poverty proportions and their changes. The model parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method for the Laplace approximation of the loglikelihood. The empirical best predictors (EBP) of proportions and changes are calculated and compared with plug-in estimators. The mean squared error of the EBP is estimated by a parametric bootstrap. A simulation experiment is carried out to study the empirical behavior of the EBP and the plug-in estimators. An application to the estimation of poverty proportions and changes in counties of the region of Valencia, Spain, is given.","Poverty proportion,Logit mixed models,Empirical best predictor,Mean squared error,Bootstrap","LABOR-FORCE INDICATORS,MEAN SQUARED ERROR,BUSINESS SURVEYS,TIME MODELS,PREDICTION,PARAMETERS,INFERENCE","Hobza, Tomas@Czech Tech Univ, Dept Math, Trojanova 13, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic::Morales, Domingo@Miguel Hernandez Univ Elche, Operat Res Ctr, Elche, Spain::Santamaria, Laureano@Miguel Hernandez Univ Elche, Operat Res Ctr, Elche, Spain","Hobza, Tomas@Czech Technical University Prague::Morales, Domingo@Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche::Santamaria, Laureano@Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche",not exist,"Small area prediction of proportions with applications to the Canadian Labour Force Survey+Berg, EJ; Fuller, WA.+J Surv Stat Methodol+2014::Poisson mixed models for studying the poverty in small areas+Boubeta, Miguel; Jose Lombardia, Maria; Morales, Domingo+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 2017::Empirical best prediction under area-level Poisson mixed models+Boubeta, Miguel; Jose Lombardia, Maria; Morales, Domingo+TEST+SEP 2016::M-quantile regression for binary data with application to small area estimation+Chambers, R; Salvati, N; Tzavidis, N.+Working Paper 12-12+2012::Small area estimation of proportions in business surveys+Chandra, Hukum; Chambers, Ray; Salvati, Nicola+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2012::no title+Demidenko, E.+Mixed Models: Theory and Applications+2013::Micro-level estimation of poverty and inequality+Elbers, C; Lanjouw, JO; Lanjouw, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2003::no title+Erciulescu, AL.+Small area prediction based on unit level models when the covariate mean is measured with error+2015::Small area prediction under alternative model specifications+Erciulescu, AL; Fuller, WA.+Stat Transit New Ser Surv Methodol Jt Iss: Small Area Estim+2014::Small area prediction of the mean of a binomial random variable+Erciulescu, AL; Fuller, WA.+JSM P SURV RES METH+2013::Small area estimation of poverty proportions under area-level time models+Esteban, M.

A dimension reduction approach for conditional Kaplan-Meier estimators,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0546-2,JUN 2018,30,0,"Many quantities of interest in survival analysis are smooth, closed-form functionals of the law of the observations. For instance, the conditional law of a lifetime of interest under random right censoring, and the conditional probability of being cured. In such cases, one can easily derive nonparametric estimators for the quantities of interest by plugging-into the functional the nonparametric estimators of the law of the observations. However, with multivariate covariates, the nonparametric estimation suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Here, a new dimension reduction approach for survival analysis is proposed and investigated in the right-censored lifetime case. First, we consider a single-index hypothesis on the conditional law of the observations and propose a asymptotically normal semiparametric estimator. Next, we apply the smooth functionals to this estimator. This results in semiparametric estimators of the quantities of interest that avoid the curse of dimensionality. Confidence regions for the index and the functional of interest are built by bootstrap. The new methodology allows to test the dimension reduction assumption, can be extended to other dimension reduction methods and can be applied to closed-form functionals of more general censoring mechanisms.","Bootstrap,Cure rate,Kernel smoothing,Semiparametric regression,Single-index,U-statistics","SINGLE-INDEX MODELS,CENSORED-DATA,REGRESSION-MODEL,SURVIVAL-DATA,CONVERGENCE,BOOTSTRAP","Li, Weiyu@CREST Ensai, Bruz, France@Shandong Univ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China::Patilea, Valentin@CREST Ensai, Bruz, France","Li, Weiyu@Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information (ENSAI)@Shandong University::Patilea, Valentin@Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information (ENSAI)",not exist,"Nonparametric regression with randomly censored survival data+Beran, R.+Technical report+1981::Conditional density estimation in a censored single-index regression model+Bouaziz, Olivier; Lopez, Olivier+BERNOULLI+MAY 2010::New estimation and inference procedures for a single-index conditional distribution model+Chiang, Chin-Tsang; Huang, Ming-Yueh+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 2012::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::UNIFORM CONSISTENCY OF THE KERNEL CONDITIONAL KAPLAN-MEIER ESTIMATE+DABROWSKA, DM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1989::NONPARAMETRIC QUANTILE REGRESSION WITH CENSORED-DATA+DABROWSKA, DM+SANKHYA-THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS SERIES A+JUN 1992::no title+DU Y+MATH METHODS STAT+2002::A SURVEY OF PRODUCT-INTEGRATION WITH A VIEW TOWARD APPLICATION IN SURVIVAL ANALYSIS+GILL, RD; JOHANSEN, S+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1990::Approximating conditional distribution functions using dimension reduction+Hall, P; Yao, QW+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2005::Semiparametric and Nonparametric Methods in Econometrics Introduction+Horowitz, Joel L.+SEMIPARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC METHODS IN ECONOMETRICS+2009::Smooth minimum distance estimation and testing with conditional estimating equations: Uniform in bandwidth theory+Lavergne, Pascal; Patilea, Valentin+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2013::A GENERAL THEORY FOR NONLINEAR SUFFICIENT DIMENSION REDUCTION: FORMULATION AND ESTIMATION+Lee, Kuang-Yao; Li, Bing; Chiaromonte, Francesca+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2013::A bootstrap approach to nonparametric regression for right censored data+Li, G; Datta, S+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+DEC 2001::Nonparametric Estimation of the Multivariate Distribution Function in a Censored Regression Model with Applications+Lopez, Olivier+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2011::EFFICIENT ESTIMATION IN SUFFICIENT DIMENSION REDUCTION+Ma, Yanyuan; Zhu, Liping+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2013::Nonparametric model checks of single-index assumptions+Maistre, S; Patilea, V.+arXiv:1410.4934+2014::REGRESSION WITH CENSORED-DATA+MILLER, R; HALPERN, J+BIOMETRIKA+1982::Product-limit estimators of the survival function for two modified forms of current-status data+Patilea, Valentin; Rolin, Jean-Marie+BERNOULLI+OCT 2006::Efficiency and bootstrap in the promotion time cure model+Portier, Francois; El Ghouch, Anouar; Van Keilegom, Ingrid+BERNOULLI+NOV 2017::Beran-based approach for single-index models under censoring+Strzalkowska-Kominiak, Ewa; Cao, Ricardo+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+OCT 2014::Maximum likelihood estimation for conditional distribution single-index models under censoring+Strzalkowska-Kominiak, Ewa; Cao, Ricardo+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+FEB 2013::CONSISTENT ESTIMATION UNDER RANDOM CENSORSHIP WHEN COVARIABLES ARE PRESENT+STUTE, W+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+APR 1993::Estimating cure rates from survival data: An alternative to two-component mixture models+Tsodikov, AD; Ibrahim, JG; Yakovlev, AY+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2003::Estimation of the conditional distribution in regression with censored data: a comparative study+Van Keilegom, I; Akritas, MG; Veraverbeke, N+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 28 2001::Weak convergence of the bootstrapped conditional Kaplan-Meier process and its quantile process+VanKeilegom, I; Veraverbeke, N+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1997::Uniform strong convergence results for the conditional Kaplan-Meier estimator and its quantiles+VanKeilegom, I; Veraverbeke, N+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1996::LINEAR-REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF CENSORED SURVIVAL-DATA BASED ON RANK-TESTS+WEI, LJ; YING, Z; LIN, DY+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1990::Dimension Reduction and Semiparametric Estimation of Survival Models+Xia, Yingcun; Zhang, Dixin; Xu, Jinfeng+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2010::Nonparametric cure rate estimation with covariates+Xu, Jianfeng; Peng, Yingwei+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 2014::Semiparametric transformation models for survival data with a cure fraction+Zeng, DL; Yin, GS; Ibrahim, JG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2006"
Controlling mixed directional false discovery rate in multidimensional decisions with applications to microarray studies,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0547-1,JUN 2018,28,0,"Time-course microarray experiments harvested samples at several time points. To reveal the dynamic gene expression changes over time, we need to identify the significant genes and detect the patterns of gene expressions, which may bring directional errors. Guo et al. (Biometrics 66(2):485-492, 2010) introduced a mixed directional false discovery rate (mdFDR) controlled procedure, which controls the sum of expected proportions of Type I and Type III errors among all rejections. In this paper, we develop weighted p value procedures for mdFDR control and give out some sufficient conditions to assure the (asymptotic) mdFDR control. Some weights and their estimators are illustrated to satisfy the sufficient conditions. The proposed weighted p value procedures are compared with the existing method by extensive simulations. Based on the proposed weighted p values procedure, we provide multiple CIs which control the false coverage-statement rate (FCR). We use the proposed methods to analyze the time-course microarray data studied in Lobenhofer et al. (Mol Endocrinol 16:1215-1229, 2002). Most of our findings are the same as those obtained by the existing method. In addition, we identify some other important genes, such as CDKN3 and NQO1.","mdFDR,FCR,Directional decisions,Multiple comparison","FAMILYWISE ERROR RATE,GENE-EXPRESSION DATA,NULL HYPOTHESES,PROPORTION","Zhao, Haibing@Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China@Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai Key Lab Financial Informat Technol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China::Fung, Wing Kam@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Zhao, Haibing@Shanghai University of Finance & Economics::Fung, Wing Kam@University of Hong Kong",not exist,"Gene expression during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster+Arbeitman, MN; Furlong, EEM; Imam, F; et al.+SCIENCE+SEP 27 2002::NQ01 stabilizes p53 through a distinct pathway+Asher, G; Lotem, J; Kama, R; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+MAR 5 2002::False discovery rate-adjusted multiple confidence intervals for selected parameters+Benjamini, Y; Yekutieli, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2005::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Multiple hypotheses testing with weights+Benjamini, Y; Hochberg, Y+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 1997::Adaptive linear step-up procedures that control the false discovery rate+Benjamini, Yoav; Krieger, Abba M.; Yekutieli, Daniel+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2006::Adaptive False Discovery Rate Control under Independence and Dependence+Blanchard, Gilles; Roquain, Etienne+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+DEC 2009::Clustering short time series gene expression data+Ernst, J; Nau, GJ; Bar-Joseph, Z+BIOINFORMATICS+JUN 2005::Controlling the familywise error rate with plug-in estimator for the proportion of true null hypotheses+Finner, Helmut; Gontscharuk, Veronika+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2009::A stochastic process approach to false discovery control+Genovese, C; Wasserman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::False discovery control with p-value weighting+Genovese, Christopher R.; Roeder, Kathryn; Wasserman, Larry+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2006::Weighted multiple testing procedures for genomic studies+Gui, Jiang; Tosteson, Tor D.; Borsuk, Mark+BIODATA MINING+JUN 7 2012::Cag pathogenicity island-specific responses of gastric epithelial cells to Helicobacter pylori infection+Guillemin, K; Salama, NR; Tompkins, LS; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+NOV 12 2002::Controlling False Discoveries in Multidimensional Directional Decisions, with Applications to Gene Expression Data on Ordered Categories+Guo, Wenge; Sarkar, Sanat K.; Peddada, Shyamal D.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2010::False Discovery Rate Control With Groups+Hu, James X.; Zhao, Hongyu; Zhou, Harrison H.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2010::Estimating the null and the proportion of nonnull effects in large-scale multiple comparisons+Jin, Jiashun; Cai, T.

Hazard estimation with censoring and measurement error: application to length of pregnancy,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0548-0,JUN 2018,23,0,"Estimation of the physiological length of pregnancy is a challenging problem since both the time origin of the pregnancy and the time of onset of labor are partly observed. The time to spontaneous labor is indeed right-censored, and the time of fertilization is only known up to an error. Therefore, data are subject to both censoring and measurement errors. We focus on the case where the measurement errors affect both the variable of interest and the censoring variable, which is the case of the timing of spontaneous delivery among pregnant women. We propose an estimation strategy to estimate the hazard rate of the underlying variable of interest. We explain the model and this strategy and provide -risk bound for the data driven resulting estimator. We also derive estimators of the survival function and the density. Simulations illustrate the performances of the estimator. Lastly, the method is applied to an original real data set of length of pregnancy to estimate rates of previable births, severe preterm births and prolonged pregnancy and the influence of the cervical length of the first semester.","Censored data,Measurement error,Survival function estimation,Hazard rate function estimation,Nonparametric methods,Deconvolution,Length of pregnancy","DECONVOLUTION PROBLEMS,DENSITY DECONVOLUTION,ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION,WAVELET ESTIMATORS,INTENSITY,SELECTION","Comte, Fabienne@Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CNRS, UMR 8145,MAP5, Paris, France::Samson, Adeline@Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, UMR 5224, Lab Jean Kuntzmann, Grenoble, France::Stirnemann, Julien J.@Univ Paris 05, GHU Necker Enfants Malad, Obstet & Maternal Fetal Med, Paris, France","Comte, Fabienne@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@University of Paris Descartes@Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite-USPC (ComUE)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Samson, Adeline@Inria@Universite Bretagne Loire (ComUE)@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes@Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA)::Stirnemann, Julien J.@Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP)@Hopital Universitaire Necker-Enfants Malades - APHP@Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite-USPC (ComUE)@University of Paris Descartes",not exist,"Histogram Selection for Possibly Censored Data+Akakpo, N.; Durot, C.+MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF STATISTICS+SEP 2010::Slope heuristics: overview and implementation+Baudry, Jean-Patrick; Maugis, Cathy; Michel, Bertrand+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+MAR 2012::Penalized contrast estimation of density and hazard rate with censored data+Brunel, E; Comte, F.+Sankhya+2005::Adaptive estimation of hazard rate with censored data+Brunel, Elodie; Comte, Fabienne+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2008::Adaptive estimation of the conditional intensity of marker-dependent counting processes+Comte, F.; Gaiffas, S.; Guilloux, A.+ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE-PROBABILITES ET STATISTIQUES+NOV 2011::Penalized contrast estimator for adaptive density deconvolution+Comte, Fabienne; Rozenholc, Yves; Taupin, Marie-Luce+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 2006::Spline regression for hazard rate estimation when data are censored and measured with error+Comte, Fabienne; Mabon, Gwennaelle; Samson, Adeline+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+MAY 2017::Predictive accuracy of changes in transvaginal sonographic cervical length over time for preterm birth: a systematic review and metaanalysis+Conde-Agudelo, Agustin; Romero, Roberto+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY+DEC 2015::ON DECONVOLUTION OF DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS+Dattner, I.; Goldenshluger, A.; Juditsky, A.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2011::Bootstrap bandwidth selection in kernel density estimation from a contaminated sample+Delaigle, A; Gijbels, I+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 2004::Adaptive estimation of hazard functions+Dohler, S.; Ruschendorf, L.+Probability and Mathematical Statistics+2002::ON THE OPTIMAL RATES OF CONVERGENCE FOR NONPARAMETRIC DECONVOLUTION PROBLEMS+FAN, JQ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1991::Wavelet deconvolution+Fan, JQ; Koo, JY+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+MAR 2002::Trends in Spontaneous and Indicated Preterm Delivery Among Singleton Gestations in the United States, 2005-2012+Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Ananth, Cande V.+OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY+DEC 2014::ESTIMATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS, MOMENTS AND QUANTILES IN DECONVOLUTION PROBLEMS+Hall, Peter; Lahiri, Soumendra N.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2008::On the block thresholding wavelet estimators with censored data+Li, Linyuan+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+SEP 2008::On the minimax optimality of wavelet estimators with censored data+Li, Linyuan+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+APR 1 2007::Pregnancy dating by fetal crown-rump length: a systematic review of charts+Napolitano, R.; Dhami, J.; Ohuma, E.

Small area estimation via unmatched sampling and linking models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0551-5,JUN 2018,30,0,The authors use an empirical Bayes (EB) approach to small area estimation under area-level unmatched sampling and linking models. Model parameters are estimated by a unified expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm and used to obtain EB estimators of area parameters. Results are extended to a nonparametric linking model based on a spline approximation. Approximate EB estimators that are computationally simpler are also obtained. Different bootstrap approaches to estimating the mean squared error (MSE) of the EB estimators are proposed. Results of a simulation study on the performance of the proposed methods are presented.

A new bivariate integer-valued GARCH model allowing for negative cross-correlation,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0552-4,JUN 2018,25,0,"Univariate integer-valued time series models, including integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) models and integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (INGARCH) models, have been well studied in the literature, but there is little progress in multivariate models. Although some multivariate INAR models were proposed, they do not provide enough flexibility in modeling count data, such as volatility of numbers of stock transactions. Then, a bivariate Poisson INGARCH model was suggested by Liu (Some models for time series of counts, Dissertations, Columbia University, 2012), but it can only deal with positive cross-correlation between two components. To remedy this defect, we propose a new bivariate Poisson INGARCH model, which is more flexible and allows for positive or negative cross-correlation. Stationarity and ergodicity of the new process are established. The maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the unknown parameters, and consistency and asymptotic normality for estimators are given. A simulation study is given to evaluate the estimators for parameters of interest. Real and artificial data examples are illustrated to demonstrate good performances of the proposed model relative to the existing model.","Bivariate,GARCH model,MLE,Negative cross-correlation,Poisson,Time series of counts","TIME-SERIES,POISSON,INFERENCE","Cui, Yan@Jilin Univ, Sch Math, 2699 Qianjin St, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China::Zhu, Fukang@Jilin Univ, Sch Math, 2699 Qianjin St, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China","Cui, Yan@Jilin University::Zhu, Fukang@Jilin University",not exist,"Poisson QMLE of Count Time Series Models+Ahmad, Ali; Francq, Christian+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAY 2016::QUASI-LIKELIHOOD INFERENCE FOR NEGATIVE BINOMIAL TIME SERIES MODELS+Christou, Vasiliki; Fokianos, Konstantinos+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+JAN 2014::Statistical analysis of count time series models: a GLM perspective+Fokianos, K.+HDB DISCRETE VALUED+2016::THEORY AND INFERENCE FOR A CLASS OF NONLINEAR MODELS WITH APPLICATION TO TIME SERIES OF COUNTS+Davis, Richard A.; Liu, Heng+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2016::On weak dependence conditions for Poisson autoregressions+Doukhan, Paul; Fokianos, Konstantinos; Tjostheim, Dag+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 2012::Integer-valued GARCH process+Ferland, Rene; Latour, Alain; Oraichi, Driss+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+NOV 2006::Log-linear Poisson autoregression+Fokianos, Konstantinos; Tjostheim, Dag+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAR 2011::Zero-inflated compound Poisson distributions in integer-valued GARCH models+Goncalves, Esmeralda; Mendes-Lopes, Nazare; Silva, Filipa+STATISTICS+2016::Multivariate autoregressive modeling of time series count data using copulas+Heinen, A.; Rengifo, E.+Journal of Empirical Finance+2007::Asymptotic inference for nonstationary GARCH+Jensen, ST; Rahbek, A+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+DEC 2004::On a bivariate Poisson distribution+Lakshminarayana, J; Pandit, SNN; Rao, KS+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1999::The multivariate GINAR(p) process+Latour, A+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+MAR 1997::Asymptotic normality and parameter change test for bivariate+Lee, S; Lee, Y; Tjotheim, D.+Poisson INGARCH models.

In this model, the form of the transformation is specified analytically (up to an unknown transformation parameter), while the regression function is completely unknown. We develop testing procedures for the null hypothesis that this semiparametric model adequately describes the data at hand. In doing so, the test statistic is formulated on the basis of Fourier-type conditional expectations, an idea first put forward by Bierens (J Econom 20:105-134, 1982). The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is obtained under the null as well as under alternative hypotheses. Since the limit null distribution is nonstandard, a bootstrap version is utilized in order to actually carry out the test procedure.

Stochastic orders to approach investments in condor financial derivatives,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0537-3,MAR 2018,19,0,"The comparison of investments is a key research topic in mathematical finance. Financial derivatives are popular tools for economic investments. A common financial derivative is the so-called condor derivative. A new mathematical framework for the comparison of investments in condor derivatives is introduced in this manuscript. That model is based on the theory of stochastic orders. Namely, a new family of stochastic orders to approach such comparison problems is introduced. That family is analyzed in detail providing characterizations of the new orders, properties and connections with other stochastic orderings. Results which permit to compare condor derivatives, when the prices of the underlying assets follow Brownian movements, or geometric Brownian movements, are developed. Moreover, an analysis with the DOWJONES and EUROSTOXX indexes shows how to use the new stochastic orders to compare investments in condor derivatives based on those indexes. On the other hand, it is shown how well-known stochastic orders can be applied to compare investments in other financial derivatives, like future derivatives, bull call spreads, call options or long straddle derivatives.","Call option,Condor derivative,(Geometric) Brownian movement,Increasing concave order,Put option,Stochastic order",DISPERSION,"Concepcion Lopez-Diaz, Maria@Univ Oviedo, Dept Matemat, C Calvo Sotelo S-N, Oviedo 33007, Spain::Lopez-Diaz, Miguel@Univ Oviedo, Dept Estadist & IO, C Calvo Sotelo S-N, Oviedo 33007, Spain@Univ Oviedo, DM, C Calvo Sotelo S-N, Oviedo 33007, Spain::Martinez-Fernandez, Sergio@Liberbank, Unidad Modelos Riesgos, Plaza La Escandalera 2, Oviedo 33003, Spain","Concepcion Lopez-Diaz, Maria@University of Oviedo::Lopez-Diaz, Miguel@University of Oviedo::Martinez-Fernandez, Sergio@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Belzunce, F.; Martinez-Riquelme, C.; Mulero, J.+An Introduction to Stochastic Orders+2016::DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR NONPARAMETRIC MODELS .3.

Stochastic ordering for populations of manufactured items,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0539-1,MAR 2018,21,0,"We develop a theory of stochastic orders for the age and the residual (remaining) lifetime for populations of manufactured identical items. The obtained theoretical results can be used by manufacturers or users for the justified decisions with respect to, e.g., the increase or decrease in the production rate or with respect to the necessary maintenance actions. Specifically, we show that if the random age of a population is smaller (resp. larger) in some stochastic sense than the defined equilibrium age, then it is also smaller (resp. larger) than the corresponding residual lifetime with respect to different stochastic orders. We discuss various stochastic comparisons between the random age and the residual lifetime for one or more populations.

On the correspondence from Bayesian log-linear modelling to logistic regression modelling with g-priors,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0540-8,MAR 2018,24,0,"Consider a set of categorical variables where at least one of them is binary. The log-linear model that describes the counts in the resulting contingency table implies a specific logistic regression model, with the binary variable as the outcome. Within the Bayesian framework, the g-prior and mixtures of g-priors are commonly assigned to the parameters of a generalized linear model. We prove that assigning a g-prior (or a mixture of g-priors) to the parameters of a certain log-linear model designates a g-prior (or a mixture of g-priors) on the parameters of the corresponding logistic regression. By deriving an asymptotic result, and with numerical illustrations, we demonstrate that when a g-prior is adopted, this correspondence extends to the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Thus, it is valid to translate inferences from fitting a log-linear model to inferences within the logistic regression framework, with regard to the presence of main effects and interaction terms.","Categorical variables,Contingency tables,Mixtures of g-priors,Prior correspondence,Posterior correspondence",VARIABLE SELECTION,"Papathomas, Michail@Univ St Andrews, Sch Math & Stat, St Andrews KY16 9LZ, Fife, Scotland","Papathomas, Michail@University of St Andrews",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::no title+Bapat, R.

Spatio-temporal analysis with short- and long-memory dependence: a state-space approach,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0541-7,MAR 2018,48,0,"This paper deals with the estimation and prediction problems of spatio-temporal processes by using state-space methodology. The spatio-temporal process is represented through an infinite moving average decomposition. This expansion is well known in time series analysis and can be extended straightforwardly in space-time. Such an approach allows easy implementation of the Kalman filter procedure for estimation and prediction of linear time processes exhibiting both short- and long-range dependence and a spatial dependence structure given on the locations. Furthermore, we consider a truncated state-space equation, which allows to calculate an approximate likelihood for large data sets. The performance of the proposed Kalman filter approach is evaluated by means of several Monte Carlo experiments implemented under different scenarios, and it is illustrated with two applications.","Kalman filter algorithm,Second-order stationary,Space-time geostatistics,Time series models","TIME COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS,KALMAN FILTER,DATA ASSIMILATION,MODELS,DEPOSITION","Ferreira, Guillermo@Univ Concepcion, Dept Stat, Concepcion, Chile::Mateu, Jorge@Univ Jaume 1, Dept Math, Castellon de La Plana, Spain::Porcu, Emilio@Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Math, Valparaiso, Chile","Ferreira, Guillermo@Universidad de Concepcion::Mateu, Jorge@Universitat Jaume I::Porcu, Emilio@Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria","Ferreira, Guillermo@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7233-9885","Estimating Space and Space-Time Covariance Functions for Large Data Sets: A Weighted Composite Likelihood Approach+Bevilacqua, Moreno; Gaetan, Carlo; Mateu, Jorge; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2012::THE SPACE-TIME DISTRIBUTION OF SULFATE DEPOSITION IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES+BILONICK, RA+ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT+1985::Rgdal: bindings for the geospatial data abstraction library+Bivand, R; Keitt, T; Rowlingson, B.+RGDAL BINDINGS GEOSP+2015::Data assimilation in atmospheric chemistry models: current status and future prospects for coupled chemistry meteorology models+Bocquet, M.; Elbern, H.; Eskes, H.; et al.+ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS+2015::no title+Brockwell, PJ; Davis, RA.+TIME SERIES THEORY M+1991::MULTIVARIATE SPATIAL INTERPOLATION AND EXPOSURE TO AIR-POLLUTANTS+BROWN, PJ; LE, ND; ZIDEK, JV+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 1994::A NEW DOUBLE-RANK MINIMISATION ALGORITHM .

The bootstrap offers such an attractive methodology in these settings, but it is well-known that its naive application in the context of shrinkage/superefficiency is fraught with danger (e.g. Samworth in Biometrika 90:985-990, 2003; Chatterjee and Lahiri in J Am Stat Assoc 106:608-625, 2011).

Inference of nonlinear mixed models for clustered data under moment conditions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0532-8,DEC 2017,16,0,"Two statistical inference problems in nonlinear mixed models (NLMM) are considered under only moment conditions on random effects and random errors. First, higher-order moment estimates of random effects and random errors in NLMM are proposed and they turn out to be strongly consistent. Second, a difference-type test is developed to test whether some sub-vector of random effects exists or not, which is easy to implement without requiring the Monte Carlo method. Its theoretical properties including the power properties are obtained. Moreover, in the special case of testing the existence of random effects, two kinds of tests are also constructed: the global difference-type test , which is a special case of , and the modified score-type test , which is motivated by in Russo et al. (TEST 21:519-545, 2012). The simulation study indicates that is the most powerful.

Testing and support recovery of multiple high-dimensional covariance matrices with false discovery rate control,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0533-7,DEC 2017,34,0,"Motivated by applications in genomics, we study in this paper four interrelated high-dimensional hypothesis testing problems on dependence structures among multiple populations. A new test statistic is constructed for testing the global hypothesis that multiple covariance matrices are equal, and its limiting null distribution is established. Correction methods are introduced to improve the accuracy of the test for finite samples. It is shown that the proposed tests are powerful against sparse alternatives and enjoy certain optimality properties. We then propose a multiple testing procedure for simultaneously testing the equality of the entries of the covariance matrices across multiple populations. The proposed method is shown to control the false discovery rate. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed tests maintain the desired error rates under the null and have good power under the alternative. The methods are also applied to a Novartis multi-tissue analysis. In addition, testing and support recovery of submatrices of multiple covariance matrices are studied.","Correction,Extreme value distribution,High-dimensional test,Limiting null distribution,Multiple testing,Sparsity","EXPRESSION MICROARRAY DATA,GENE-EXPRESSION,DEPENDENCE","Xia, Yin@Fudan Univ, Dept Stat, Sch Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Xia, Yin@Fudan University",not exist,"no title+Anderson, T.

Computation of optimum Type-II progressively hybrid censoring schemes using variable neighborhood search algorithm,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0534-6,DEC 2017,29,0,"Type-II progressively hybrid censoring scheme is a mixture of Type-II progressive censoring and Type-I censoring schemes. In this article, we first derive the expression of Fisher information matrix based on Type-II progressively hybrid censored data for multi-parameter distribution. We then propose a cost minimization-based optimality criterion to determine optimum Type-II progressively hybrid censoring schemes. Determination of optimum schemes through exhaustive search within the set of all admissible censoring schemes for large sample sizes is not feasible in practice. We propose a meta-heuristic algorithm based on variable neighborhood search approach for large sample sizes. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out in order to study the effect of mis-specification of parameter values or cost coefficients on the optimum solution. Finally, we also discuss A-, D- and T- optimum censoring schemes.","Cost function,A-optimality,D-optimality,Information matrix,Variable neighborhood search algorithm,Near-optimal solution","WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION,FISHER INFORMATION,COST FUNCTION,INFERENCE,PLANS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Bhattacharya, Ritwik@Ctr Invest Matemat CIMAT, Monterrey 66629, Mexico::Pradhan, Biswabrata@Indian Stat Inst, SQC & OR Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India","Bhattacharya, Ritwik@Unknow::Pradhan, Biswabrata@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute",not exist,"Progressive censoring methodology: an appraisal+Balakrishnan, N.+TEST+AUG 2007::Optimum life testing plans in presence of hybrid censoring: A cost function approach+Bhattacharya, R.; Pradhan, B.; Dewanji, A.+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY+SEP-OCT 2014::On optimum Type-II progressively hybrid censoring schemes+Bhattacharya, R; Pradhan, B.+Technical Report No. SQCOR-2015-01+2015::Computation of optimum reliability acceptance sampling plans in presence of hybrid censoring+Bhattacharya, Ritwik; Pradhan, Biswabrata; Dewanji, Anup+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 2015::On optimum life-testing plans under Type-II progressive censoring scheme using variable neighborhood search algorithm+Bhattacharya, Ritwik; Pradhan, Biswabrata; Dewanji, Anup+TEST+JUN 2016::MOST ECONOMICAL CHOICE OF A LIFE TESTING PROCEDURE FOR EXPONENTIALLY DISTRIBUTED DATA+BLIGHT, BJN+TECHNOMETRICS+1972::On optimality of extremal schemes in progressive type II censoring+Burkschat, M.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 2008::Exact likelihood inference for the two-parameter exponential distribution under Type-II progressively hybrid censoring+Chan, Ping Shing; Ng, Hon Keung Tony; Su, Feng+METRIKA+AUG 2015::Exact likelihood inference for an exponential parameter under progressive hybrid censoring schemes+Childs, A.; Chandrasekar, B.; Balakrishnan, N.+STATISTICAL MODELS AND METHODS FOR BIOMEDICAL AND TECHNICAL SYSTEMS+2008::On some exact distributional results based on Type-I progressively hybrid censored data from exponential distributions+Cramer, Erhard; Balakrishnan, N.+STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+JAN 2013::A- and D-optimal progressive Type-II censoring designs based on Fisher information+Dahmen, K.; Burkschat, M.; Cramer, E.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2012::DETERMINING THE SAMPLE-SIZE FOR A HYBRID LIFE TEST BASED ON THE COST FUNCTION+EBRAHIMI, N+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+FEB 1988::FISHERS INFORMATION IN TERMS OF THE HAZARD RATE+EFRON, B; JOHNSTONE, IM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1990::Sampling procedures and tables for life and reliability testing (Based on exponential distribution)+Epstein, B.+QUALITY CONTROL RELI+1960::no title+Feller, W.+An introduction to probability theory and its applications+2013::Review of Nonlinear Mixed-Integer and Disjunctive Programming Techniques+Grossmann, Ignacio E.+OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING+SEP 2002::On distributions of generalized order statistics+Kamps, U; Cramer, E+STATISTICS+2001::Analysis of Type-II progressively hybrid censored data+Kundu, D; Joarder, A+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 20 2006::Statistical Inference of Type-II Progressively Hybrid Censored Data with Weibull Lifetimes+Lin, Chien-Tai; Ng, Hon Keung Tony; Chan, Ping Shing+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2009::Inference for the Weibull distribution with progressive hybrid censoring+Lin, Chien-Tai; Chou, Cheng-Chieh; Huang, Yen-Lung+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 1 2012::On progressive hybrid censored exponential distribution+Lin, Chien-Tai; Huang, Yen-Lung+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2012::Topics in optimal design+Liski, EP; Mandal, NK; Shah, KR<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Sinha, BK</span>.+LECT NOTES STAT+2002::Sequential variable neighborhood descent variants: an empirical study on the traveling salesman problem+Mjirda, A; Todosijevic, R; Hanafi, S<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Hansen, P; Mladenovic, N</span>.+Int Trans Oper Res+2016::Inference for Weibull distribution based on progressively Type-II hybrid censored data+Mokhtari, Elham Bayat; Rad, A.

Comparison results for inactivity times of k-out-of-n and general coherent systems with dependent components,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0535-5,DEC 2017,28,2,"Coherent systems, i.e., multicomponent systems where every component monotonically affects the working state or failure of the whole system, are among the main objects of study in reliability analysis. Consider a coherent system with possibly dependent components having lifetime T, and assume we know that it failed before a given time . Its inactivity time can be evaluated under different conditional events. In fact, one might just know that the system has failed and then consider the inactivity time , or one may also know which ones of the components have failed before time t, and then consider the corresponding system's inactivity time under this condition. For all these cases, we obtain a representation of the reliability function of system inactivity time based on the recently defined notion of distortion functions. Making use of these representations, new stochastic comparison results for inactivity times of systems under the different conditional events are provided. These results can also be applied to order statistics which can be seen as particular cases of coherent systems (k-out-of-n systems, i.e., systems which work when at least k of their n components work).","Reliability,Inactivity time,Coherent systems,Stochastic orders,Distortion functions,Copula","PARALLEL SYSTEMS,REPRESENTATIONS,LIFETIMES,RELIABILITY,ORDERINGS","Navarro, Jorge@Univ Murcia, Fac Matemat, Murcia 30100, Spain::Longobardi, Maria@Univ Napoli FEDERICO II, Dipartimento Matemat & Applicaz, Via Cintia, Naples, Italy::Pellerey, Franco@Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Sci Matemat, Cso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy","Navarro, Jorge@University of Murcia::Longobardi, Maria@University of Naples Federico II::Pellerey, Franco@Polytechnic University of Turin",not exist,"Statistical Theory of Reliability and Lite Testing+Barlow, R.E.; Proschan, F.+INT SERIES DECISION+1975::Relations among univariate aging, bivariate aging and dependence for exchangeable lifetimes+Bassan, B; Spizzichino, F+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+APR 2005::Some notions of multivariate positive dependence+Colangelo, A; Scarsini, M; Shaked, M+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+AUG 23 2005::no title+Durante, F.; Sempi, C.+Principles of Copula Theory+2015::On representations of 2-increasing binary aggregation functions+Durante, Fabrizio; Saminger-Platz, Susanne; Sarkoci, Peter+INFORMATION SCIENCES+DEC 1 2008::A study on the conditional inactivity time of coherent systems+Goli, S.; Asadi, M.+METRIKA+FEB 2017::no title+Grabisch, M.; Marichal, J. -L.; Mesiar, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Pap, E</span>.+Aggregation Functions+2009::CLASSES OF ORDERINGS OF MEASURES AND RELATED CORRELATION INEQUALITIES .1.

Fast estimation of the median covariation matrix with application to online robust principal components analysis,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0519-x,SEP 2017,33,0,"The geometric median covariation matrix is a robust multivariate indicator of dispersion which can be extended to infinite dimensional spaces. We define estimators, based on recursive algorithms, that can be simply updated at each new observation and are able to deal rapidly with large samples of high-dimensional data without being obliged to store all the data in memory. Asymptotic convergence properties of the recursive algorithms are studied under weak conditions in general separable Hilbert spaces. The computation of the principal components can also be performed online and this approach can be useful for online outlier detection. A simulation study clearly shows that this robust indicator is a competitive alternative to minimum covariance determinant when the dimension of the data is small and robust principal components analysis based on projection pursuit and spherical projections for high-dimension data.

Bandwidth selection in kernel density estimation for interval-grouped data,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0523-9,SEP 2017,23,0,"When interval-grouped data are available, the classical Parzen-Rosenblatt kernel density estimator has to be modified to get a computable and useful approach in this context. The new nonparametric grouped data estimator needs of the choice of a smoothing parameter. In this paper, two different bandwidth selectors for this estimator are analyzed. A plug-in bandwidth selector is proposed and its relative rate of convergence obtained. Additionally, a bootstrap algorithm to select the bandwidth in this framework is designed. This method is easy to implement and does not require Monte Carlo. Both proposals are compared through simulations in different scenarios. It is observed that when the sample size is medium or large and grouping is not heavy, both bandwidth selection methods have a similar and good performance. However, when the sample size is large and under heavy grouping scenarios, the bootstrap bandwidth selector leads to better results.","Smoothing parameter selection,Plug-in bandwidth,Bootstrap bandwidth selector,Interval data","INTEGRATED SQUARED ERROR,BOOTSTRAP CHOICE","Reyes, Miguel@Ctr Invest Matemat, Jalisco S-N, Guanajuato 36240, Gto, Mexico::Francisco-Fernandez, Mario@Univ A Coruna, Res Grp MODES, Dept Matemat, Fac Informat, Elvina 15071, A Coruna, Spain::Cao, Ricardo@Univ A Coruna, Res Grp MODES, Dept Matemat, Fac Informat, Elvina 15071, A Coruna, Spain","Reyes, Miguel@CIMAT - Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas::Francisco-Fernandez, Mario@Universidade da Coruna::Cao, Ricardo@Universidade da Coruna",not exist,"AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF CROSS-VALIDATION FOR THE SMOOTHING OF DENSITY ESTIMATES+BOWMAN, AW+BIOMETRIKA+1984::Computing statistical indices for hydrothermal times using weed emergence data+Cao, R.; Francisco-Fernandez, M.; Anand, A.; et al.+JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE+DEC 2011::BOOTSTRAPPING THE MEAN INTEGRATED SQUARED ERROR+CAO, R+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+APR 1993::Multivariate plug-in bandwidth selection with unconstrained pilot bandwidth matrices+Chacon, J.

On the asymptotics of minimum disparity estimation,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0520-4,SEP 2017,33,0,"Inference procedures based on the minimization of divergences are popular statistical tools. Beran (Ann stat 5(3):445-463, 1977) proved consistency and asymptotic normality of the minimum Hellinger distance (MHD) estimator. This method was later extended to the large class of disparities in discrete models by Lindsay (Ann stat 22(2):1081-1114, 1994) who proved existence of a sequence of roots of the estimating equation which is consistent and asymptotically normal. However, the current literature does not provide a general asymptotic result about the minimizer of a generic disparity. In this paper, we prove, under very general conditions, an asymptotic representation of the minimum disparity estimator itself (and not just for a root of the estimating equation), thus generalizing the results of Beran (Ann stat 5(3):445-463, 1977) and Lindsay (Ann stat 22(2):1081-1114, 1994). This leads to a general framework for minimum disparity estimation encompassing both discrete and continuous models.","Disparity,Quadratic approximation,Non-parametric density estimation","HELLINGER DISTANCE,PARAMETRIC MODELS,EFFICIENCY,DISTRIBUTIONS,ROBUSTNESS,CONSISTENCY,DIVERGENCE,TESTS","Kuchibhotla, Arun Kumar@Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA::Basu, Ayanendranath@Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata, India","Kuchibhotla, Arun Kumar@University of Pennsylvania::Basu, Ayanendranath@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute",not exist,"A GENERAL CLASS OF COEFFICIENTS OF DIVERGENCE OF 1 DISTRIBUTION FROM ANOTHER+ALI, SM; SILVEY, SD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1966::2 STAGE LEAST ABSOLUTE DEVIATIONS ESTIMATORS+AMEMIYA, T+ECONOMETRICA+1982::MINIMUM DISPARITY ESTIMATION FOR CONTINUOUS MODELS - EFFICIENCY, DISTRIBUTIONS AND ROBUSTNESS+BASU, A; LINDSAY, BG+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+DEC 1994::Minimum negative exponential disparity estimation in parametric models+Basu, A; Sarkar, S; Vidyashankar, AN+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 15 1997::no title+Basu, A.; Shioya, H.; Park, C.+Statistical Inference: The Minimum Distance Approach+2011::MINIMUM HELLINGER DISTANCE ESTIMATES FOR PARAMETRIC MODELS+BERAN, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1977::Minimum Hellinger distance estimation for randomized play the winner design+Cheng, AL; Vidyashankar, AN+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 1 2006::MULTINOMIAL GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS+CRESSIE, N; READ, TRC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1984::Nonparametric Density Estimation: The L1 View+Devroye, L.; Gyorfi, L.+WILEY SERIES PROBABI+1985::Consistency of generalized maximum spacing estimates+Ekstrom, M+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2001::COMPARISON OF SOME METHODS FOR ESTIMATING MIXED NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+FRYER, JG; ROBERTSO.CA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::A general estimation method using spacings+Ghosh, K; Jammalamadaka, SR+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1 2001::Probability: A Graduate Course, 2nd Edition+Gut, A+PROBABILITY: A GRADUATE COURSE, 2ND EDITION+2013::Minimum Hellinger distance point estimates consistent under weak family regularity+Gyorfi, L.; Vajda, I.; van der Meulen, E.

We introduce natural notions of center and a depth function for networks that evolve in time. We develop several statistical techniques including testing, supervised and unsupervised classification, and some notions of principal component sets in the space of networks.

Jump-detection-based estimation in time-varying coefficient models and empirical applications,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0525-7,SEP 2017,28,0,"Time-varying coefficient models are very important tools to explore the hidden structure between the response variable and its predictors. In some applications, the coefficient curves have singularities, including jump points at some unknown positions, representing structural changes of the related processes. Detection of such singularities is important for understanding the structural changes. In this paper, an alternative jump-detection procedure is proposed based on the first-order and second-order derivatives of the coefficient curves. Based on the detected jump points, a coefficient curve estimation procedure is also proposed, which can preserve the jump structure well when the noise level is small. Further, the implementation of turning parameters is discussed. Under some mild conditions, the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established not only in the continuous regions of coefficient functions, but also in the neighborhoods of the jump points. Finally, we demonstrate, using both simulation and empirical examples, that the proposed methodologies perform well.","Bootstrap,Local polynomial estimation,Jump detection,Turning parameters,Time-varying coefficient","LONGITUDINAL DATA,REGRESSION-MODELS,SERIES,CURVE","Zhao, Yan-Yong@Nanjing Audit Univ, Dept Stat, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China::Lin, Jin-Guan@Nanjing Audit Univ, Dept Stat, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China::Wang, Hong-Xia@Nanjing Audit Univ, Dept Stat, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China::Huang, Xing-Fang@Nanjing Audit Univ, Dept Stat, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Zhao, Yan-Yong@Nanjing Audit University::Lin, Jin-Guan@Nanjing Audit University::Wang, Hong-Xia@Nanjing Audit University::Huang, Xing-Fang@Nanjing Audit University",not exist,"P-splines quantile regression estimation in varying coefficient models+Andriyana, Y.; Gijbels, I.; Verhasselt, A.+TEST+MAR 2014::Detecting abrupt changes by wavelet methods+Antoniadis, A; Gijbels, I+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+APR 2002::Trending time-varying coefficient time series models with serially correlated errors+Cai, Zongwu+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 2007::Functional-coefficient regression models for nonlinear time series+Cai, ZW; Fan, JQ; Yao, QW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::Edge-preserving smoothers for image processing+Chu, CK; Glad, IK; Godtliebsen, F; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1998::no title+Cochrane, J.C.+Asset pricing+2001::ESTIMATION IN PRESENCE OF STOCHASTIC PARAMETER VARIATION+COOLEY, TF; PRESCOTT, EC+ECONOMETRICA+1976::On regression estimators with de-noised variables+Cui, HJ; He, XM; Zhu, LX+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2002::NEW EFFICIENT AND ROBUST ESTIMATION IN VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS WITH HETEROSCEDASTICITY+Guo, Jie; Tian, Maozai; Zhu, Kai+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2012::EDGE-PRESERVING AND PEAK-PRESERVING SMOOTHING+HALL, P; TITTERINGTON, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1992::Functional coefficient regression models for non-linear time series: A polynomial spline approach+Huang, JHZ; Shen, HP+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2004::Jump Detection in a Regression Curve and Its Derivative+Joo, Jong-Hoon; Qiu, Peihua+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 2009::SMOOTH VARYING-COEFFICIENT ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE FOR QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA+Li, Qi; Racine, Jeffrey S.+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+DEC 2010::no title+Liang, H; Hardle, W.+Partially linear models.+2007::On the estimation and testing of time varying constraints in econometric models+Orbe, Susan; Ferreira, Eva; Rodriguez-Poo, Juan+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2006::Asymptotically minimax estimation of a function with jumps+Oudshoorn, CGM+BERNOULLI+MAR 1998::A jump-preserving curve fitting procedure based on local piecewise-linear kernel estimation+Qiu, PH+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+AUG-OCT 2003::Size, time-varying beta, and conditional heteroscedasticity in UK stock returns+Reyes, M.+Review of Financial Economics+1999::ESTIMATION OF STATIONARY STOCHASTIC REGRESSION PARAMETERS REEXAMINED+ROSENBERG, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1972::Variable selection in quantile varying coefficient models with longitudinal data+Tang, Yanlin; Wang, Huixia Judy; Zhu, Zhongyi+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 2013::no title+Tsay, R.

New properties of the orthant convex-type stochastic orders,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0527-5,SEP 2017,24,0,"The orthant convex and concave orders have been studied in the literature as extensions of univariate variability orders. In this paper, new results are proposed for bivariate orthant convex-type orders between vectors. In particular, we prove that these orders cannot be considered as dependence orders since they fail to verify several desirable properties that any positive dependence order should satisfy. Among other results, the relationships between these orders under certain transformations are presented, as well as that the orthant convex orders between bivariate random vectors with the same means are sufficient conditions to order the corresponding covariances. We also show that establishing the upper orthant convex or lower orthant concave orders between two vectors in the same Fr,chet class is not equivalent to establishing these orders between the corresponding copulas except when marginals are uniform distributions. Several examples related with concordance measures, such as Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho, are also given, as are results on mixture models.","Concordance measures,Dependence stochastic orders,Mixturemodels,Orthant convex stochastic orders","DEPENDENCE,DISTRIBUTIONS,MODELS,SUMS","Fernandez-Ponce, J.

Optimal approximate designs for comparison with control in dose-escalation studies,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0529-3,SEP 2017,23,0,"Consider an experiment, in which a new drug is tested for the first time on human subjects, namely healthy volunteers. Such experiments are often performed as dose-escalation studies: a set of increasing doses is preselected; individuals are grouped into cohorts; and in each cohort, dose number i can be administered only if dose number has already been tested in the previous cohort. If an adverse effect of a dose is observed, the experiment is stopped, and thus, no subjects are exposed to higher doses. In this paper, we assume that the response is affected both by the dose or placebo effects and by the cohort effects. We provide optimal approximate designs for estimating the effects of the drug doses compared with the placebo with respect to selected optimality criteria (E-, MV- and LV-optimality). In particular, we prove the optimality of the so-called Senn designs with respect to all of the studied optimality criteria, and we provide optimal extensions of these designs for selected criteria.","Dose-escalation studies,Approximate designs,Comparison with control,Optimal designs,Block designs","INCOMPLETE BLOCK-DESIGNS,QUANTITATIVE RESPONSES,TRIALS,REGRESSION","Rosa, Samuel@Comenius Univ, Fac Math Phys & Informat, Bratislava, Slovakia::Harman, Radoslav@Comenius Univ, Fac Math Phys & Informat, Bratislava, Slovakia","Rosa, Samuel@Comenius University Bratislava::Harman, Radoslav@Comenius University Bratislava",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, A.

New two-sample tests for skewed populations and their connection to theoretical power of Bootstrap-t test,TEST,10.1007/s11749-017-0530-x,SEP 2017,17,0,"Various tests are available to compare the means of two populations. Tests for skewed data, however, are not well studied even though they are often needed in pharmaceutical study and agricultural economics. In particular, there is no available result to give power and sample size calculation for a two-sample Bootstrap-t test in skewed populations. In this paper, we propose easy-to-compute new tests and study their theoretical properties. The proposed work starts with derivation of a second-order Edgeworth expansion for the pooled two-sample t-statistic. Then new test rejection regions are formed based on Cornish-Fisher expansion of quantiles. The new tests account for first-order and second-order population skewnesses that were ignored in two-sample t test. We report the theoretical type I error accuracy and power of the newly proposed tests and the large sample t test. We also provide the detailed conditions under which the proposed tests give better power than the two-sample large sample test. Our new tests, and TCF, are asymptotically equivalent to Bootstrap-t test up to and , respectively. Compared with commonly used two-sample parametric and nonparametric tests, the new tests are computationally efficient, give better power for skewed data with moderate sample size, and provide sample size calculation to achieve desired power at a given significance level.

Marginal integration M-estimators for additive models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0508-0,JUN 2017,31,0,"Additive regression models have a long history in multivariate non-parametric regression. They provide a model in which the regression function is decomposed as a sum of functions, each of them depending only on a single explanatory variable. The advantage of additive models over general non-parametric regression models is that they allow to obtain estimators converging at the optimal univariate rate avoiding the so-called curse of dimensionality. Beyond backfitting, marginal integration is a common procedure to estimate each component in additive models. In this paper, we propose a robust estimator of the additive components which combines local polynomials on the component to be estimated with the marginal integration procedure. The proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. A simulation study allows to show the advantage of the proposal over the classical one when outliers are present in the responses, leading to estimators with good robustness and efficiency properties.","Additive models,Local M-estimation,Kernel weights,Marginal integration,Robustness","ROBUST NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,SELECTION","Boente, Graciela@Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Matemat, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Ciudad Univ,Pabellon 1, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina@Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IMAS, Ciudad Univ,Pabellon 1, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina::Martinez, Alejandra@Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Matemat, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Ciudad Univ,Pabellon 1, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina@Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IMAS, Ciudad Univ,Pabellon 1, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Boente, Graciela@Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)@University of Buenos Aires::Martinez, Alejandra@Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)@University of Buenos Aires",not exist,"An Outlier-Robust Fit for Generalized Additive Models With Applications to Disease Outbreak Detection+Alimadad, Azadeh; Salibian-Barrera, Matias+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2011::KERNEL ESTIMATION FOR ADDITIVE-MODELS UNDER DEPENDENCE+BAEK, J; WEHRLY, TE+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+AUG 1993::Robust kernel estimators for additive models with dependent observations+Bianco, A; Boente, G+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 1998::Robust estimators under semi-parametric partly linear autoregression: Asymptotic behaviour and bandwidth selection+Bianco, Ana; Boente, Graciela+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAR 2007::ROBUST NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION ESTIMATION+BOENTE, G; FRAIMAN, R+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAY 1989::Robust plug-in bandwidth estimators in nonparametric regression+Boente, G; Fraiman, R; Meloche, J+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JAN 15 1997::Estimating additive models with missing responses+Boente, Graciela; Martinez, Alejandra M.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2016::Robust nonparametric estimation with missing data+Boente, Graciela; Gonzalez-Manteiga, Wenceslao; Perez-Gonzalez, Ana+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1 2009::On a robust local estimator for the scale function in heteroscedastic nonparametric regression+Boente, Graciela; Ruiz, Marcelo; Zamar, Ruben H.+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+AUG 1 2010::LINEAR SMOOTHERS AND ADDITIVE-MODELS+BUJA, A; HASTIE, T; TIBSHIRANI, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1989::Resistant selection of the smoothing parameter for smoothing splines+Cantoni, E; Ronchetti, E+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+APR 2001::Nonparametric estimation of additive separable regression models+Chen, R; Hardle, W; Linton, O<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Serverance-Lossin, E</span>.+Statistical theory and computational aspects of smoothing+1996::Robust Estimation of Mean and Dispersion Functions in Extended Generalized Additive Models+Croux, Christophe; Gijbels, Irene; Prosdocimi, Ilaria+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2012::Rate optimal estimation with the integration method in the presence of many covariates+Hengartner, NW; Sperlich, S+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2005::UNIFORM BAHADUR REPRESENTATION FOR LOCAL POLYNOMIAL ESTIMATES OF M-REGRESSION AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE ADDITIVE MODEL+Kong, Efang; Linton, Oliver; Xia, Yingcun+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+OCT 2010::Bandwidth Selection in Robust Smoothing+Leung, D.H.Y.; Marriott, F.H.C.; Wu, E.K.H.+Journal of Nonparametric Statistics+1993::Cross-validation in nonparametric regression with outliers+Leung, DHY+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2005::no title+Li, J; Zheng, Z; Zheng, M.+Robust estimation of additive models based on marginal integration+2012::A KERNEL-METHOD OF ESTIMATING STRUCTURED NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION-BASED ON MARGINAL INTEGRATION+LINTON, O; NIELSEN, JP+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1995::no title+Maronna, R.

Bias-corrected and robust estimation of the bivariate stable tail dependence function,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0511-5,JUN 2017,26,1,"The stable tail dependence function gives a full characterisation of the extremal dependence between two or more random variables. In this paper, we propose an estimator for this function which is robust against outliers in the sample. The estimator is derived from a bivariate second-order tail model together with a proper transformation of the bivariate observations, and its asymptotic properties are studied under some suitable regularity conditions. Our estimation procedure depends on two parameters: , which controls the trade-off between efficiency and robustness of the estimator, and a second-order parameter , which can be replaced by a fixed value or by an estimate. In case where has been replaced by the true value or by an external consistent estimator, our robust estimator is asymptotically unbiased, whereas in case where is mis-specified, one loses this property, but still our estimator performs quite well with respect to bias. The finite sample performance of our robust and bias-corrected estimator of the stable tail dependence function is examined on a simulation study involving uncontaminated and contaminated samples. In particular, its behavior is illustrated for different values of the pair and is compared with alternative estimators from the extreme value literature.","Multivariate extreme value statistics,Stable tail dependence function,Robustness,Bias-correction","INDEPENDENCE,COEFFICIENT,STATISTICS,INDEX","Escobar-Bach, Mikael@Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark::Goegebeur, Yuri@Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark::Guillou, Armelle@Univ Strasbourg, UMR 7501, Avancee, Inst Rech Math, 7 Rue Rene Descartes, F-67084 Strasbourg, France@CNRS, 7 Rue Rene Descartes, F-67084 Strasbourg, France::You, Alexandre@Soc Gen Insurance Sogessur, Direct Tech, Tour D2-17 Bis Pl Reflets, F-92919 Paris 2, France","Escobar-Bach, Mikael@University of Southern Denmark::Goegebeur, Yuri@University of Southern Denmark::Guillou, Armelle@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Universite de Strasbourg@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes::You, Alexandre@Unknow","Escobar-Bach, Mikael@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2158-3068","Non-parametric estimators of multivariate extreme dependence functions+Abdous, B; Ghoudi, K+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+DEC 2005::Robust and efficient estimation by minimising a density power divergence+Basu, A; Harris, IR; Hjort, NL; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::Tail index estimation and an exponential regression model+Beirlant, J.; Dierckx, G.; Goegebeur, Y.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Matthys, G</span>.+Extremes+1999::Bias-reduced estimators for bivariate tail modelling+Beirlant, J.; Dierckx, G.; Guillou, A.+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+JUL 2011::no title+Beirlant, J; Goegebeur, Y; Segers, J.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Teugels, J</span>.+Statistics of Extremes: Theory and application+2004::Some comments on the estimation of a dependence index in bivariate extreme value statistics+Beirlant, J; Vandewalle, B+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+DEC 1 2002::Bias-corrected estimation of stable tail dependence function+Beirlant, Jan; Escobar-Bach, Mikael; Goegebeur, Yuri; et al.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2016::Second-order refined peaks-over-threshold modelling for heavy-tailed distributions+Beirlant, Jan; Joossens, Elisabeth; Segers, Johan+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 2009::NEW ESTIMATORS OF THE PICKANDS DEPENDENCE FUNCTION AND A TEST FOR EXTREME-VALUE DEPENDENCE+Buecher, Axel; Dette, Holger; Volgushev, Stanislav+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2011::no title+CAPERAA P+EXTREMES+2000::no title+de Haan,, L.; Ferreira,, A.+Extreme value theory - An introduction+2006::Bivariate tall estimation: dependence in asymptotic independence+Draisma, G; Drees, H; Ferreira, A; et al.+BERNOULLI+APR 2004::Best attainable rates of convergence for estimators of the stable tail dependence function+Drees, H; Huang, X+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 1998::Robust and bias-corrected estimation of the coefficient of tail dependence+Dutang, Christophe; Goegebeur, Yuri; Guillou, Armelle+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+JUL 2014::Estimating the spectral measure of an extreme value distribution+Einmahl, JHJ; deHaan, L; Sinha, AK+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+OCT 15 1997::Estimating a tail exponent by modelling departure from a Pareto distribution+Feuerverger, A; Hall, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::BIAS CORRECTION IN MULTIVARIATE EXTREMES+Fougeres, Anne-Laure; de Haan, Laurens; Mercadier, Cecile+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2015::Asymptotically Unbiased Estimation of the Coefficient of Tail Dependence+Goegebeur, Yuri; Guillou, Armelle+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2013::Tail index estimation for heavy-tailed models: accommodation of bias in weighted log-excesses+Gomes, M.

Testing the hypothesis of a block compound symmetric covariance matrix for elliptically contoured distributions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0512-4,JUN 2017,40,4,"In this paper, the authors study the problem of testing the hypothesis of a block compound symmetry covariance matrix with two-level multivariate observations, taken for m variables over u sites or time points. Through the use of a suitable block-diagonalization of the hypothesis matrix, it is possible to obtain a decomposition of the main hypothesis into two sub-hypotheses. Using this decomposition, it is then possible to obtain the likelihood ratio test statistic as well as its exact moments in a much simpler way. The exact distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic is then analyzed. Because this distribution is quite elaborate, yielding a non-manageable distribution function, a manageable but very precise near-exact distribution is developed. Numerical studies conducted to evaluate the closeness between this near-exact distribution and the exact distribution show the very good performance of this approximation even for very small sample sizes and the approach followed allows us to extend its validity to situations where the population distributions are elliptically contoured. A real-data example is presented and a simulation study is also conducted.","Beta random variables,Characteristic function,Composition of hypotheses,Likelihood ratio statistic,Near-exact distributions,Product distribution","LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST,NEAR-EXACT DISTRIBUTIONS,INTEGER GAMMA-DISTRIBUTION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,MULTIVARIATE DATA,RANDOM-VARIABLES,SPHERICITY TEST,LINEAR-MODELS,STATISTICS,SELECTION","Coelho, Carlos A.@Univ Nova Lisboa, Dept Matemat, Caparica, Portugal@Univ Nova Lisboa, Ctr Matemat & Aplicacoes, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Caparica, Portugal::Roy, Anuradha@Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Management Sci & Stat, San Antonio, TX USA","Coelho, Carlos A.@Universidade Nova de Lisboa::Roy, Anuradha@University of Texas System@University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)","Coelho, Carlos@A-3078-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5628-0625::Roy, Anuradha@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0294-6185","no title+Anderson, T.

Dating multiple change points in the correlation matrix,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0513-3,JUN 2017,32,2,"A nonparametric procedure for detecting and dating multiple change points in the correlation matrix of sequences of random variables is proposed. The procedure is based on a recently proposed test for changes in correlation matrices at an unknown point in time. Although the procedure requires constant expectations and variances, only mild assumptions on the serial dependence structure are assumed. The convergence rate of the change point estimators is derived and the asymptotic validity of the procedure is proved. Moreover, the performance of the proposed algorithm in finite samples is illustrated by means of a simulation study and the analysis of a real data example with financial returns.

A mixture of g-priors for variable selection when the number of regressors grows with the sample size,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0516-0,JUN 2017,36,1,"We consider the problem of variable selection in linear regression using mixtures of g-priors. A number of mixtures have been proposed in the literature which work well, especially when the number of regressors p is fixed. In this paper, we propose a mixture of g-priors suitable for the case when p grows with the sample size n, more specifically when , . The marginal density based on the proposed mixture has a nice approximation with a closed form expression, which makes application of the method as tractable as an information criterion-based method. The proposed method satisfies fundamental properties like model selection consistency when the true model lies in the model space, and also consistency in an appropriate sense, under misspecified models setup. The method is quite robust in the sense that the above properties are not confined to normal linear models; they continue to hold under reasonable conditions for a general class of error distributions. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed prior theoretically with that of some other mixtures of g-priors. We also compare it with several other Bayesian methods of model selection using simulated data sets. Theoretically, as well as in simulations, it emerges that unlike most of the other methods of model selection, the proposed prior is competent enough while selecting the true model irrespective of its dimension.","Model selection consistency,Misspecified models,General class of distributions of errors,Kullback-Leibler divergence","BAYES FACTORS,MODEL SELECTION,CONSISTENCY,OPTIMALITY","Mukhopadhyay, Minerva@Indian Stat Inst, Interdisciplinary Stat Res Unit, Kolkata, India::Samanta, Tapas@Indian Stat Inst, Appl Stat Unit, Kolkata, India","Mukhopadhyay, Minerva@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute::Samanta, Tapas@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute",not exist,"A comment on D.

Log-symmetric regression models under the presence of non-informative left- or right-censored observations,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0517-z,JUN 2017,40,0,"In this paper, an extension to allow the presence of non-informative left- or right-censored observations in log-symmetric regression models is addressed. Under such models, the log-lifetime distribution belongs to the symmetric class and its location and scale parameters are described by semi-parametric functions of explanatory variables, whose nonparametric components are approximated using natural cubic splines or P-splines. An iterative process of parameter estimation by the maximum penalized likelihood method is presented. The large sample properties of the maximum penalized likelihood estimators are studied analytically and by simulation experiments. Diagnostic methods such as deviance-type residuals and local influence measures are derived. The package ssym, which includes an implementation in the computational environment R of the methodology addressed in this paper, is also discussed. The proposed methodology is illustrated by the analysis of a real data set.","Survival analysis,Accelerated lifetime models,Symmetric distributions,Robust estimation,Backfitting algorithm,Additive model","LOCAL INFLUENCE,SPLINES","Hernando Vanegas, Luis@Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Estadist, Bogota, Colombia::Paula, Gilberto A.@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Matemat & Estat, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Hernando Vanegas, Luis@Universidad Nacional de Colombia::Paula, Gilberto A.@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Paula, Gilberto@D-2924-2012","Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike+1998::no title+Bagdonavicius, V; Nikulin, M.+Accelerated life models.

Shape testing in varying coefficient models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0518-y,JUN 2017,18,0,"We consider varying coefficient models which are an extension of the classical linear regression models in the sense that the regression coefficients are replaced by functions in certain variables (often time). Varying coefficient models have been popular in longitudinal data and panel data studies, and have been applied in fields, such as finance and health sciences. We estimate the coefficient functions by splines. An important question in a varying coefficient model is whether a coefficient function is monotone or convex. We develop consistent testing procedures for monotonicity and convexity. Moreover, we provide procedures to test simultaneously the shapes of certain coefficient functions in a varying coefficient model. The tests use constrained and unconstrained regression splines. The performances of the proposed tests are illustrated on simulated data. We also give a real data application.","B-spline approximation,Consistency,Convexity,Monotonicity,Testing,Varying coefficient models","LONGITUDINAL DATA,MONOTONICITY,REGRESSION,INFERENCE,SPLINES","Ahkim, M.@Univ Antwerp, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Antwerp, Belgium::Gijbels, I.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Leuven, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr LStat, Leuven, Belgium::Verhasselt, A.@Univ Hasselt, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, Censtat, Hasselt, Belgium","Ahkim, M.@University of Antwerp::Gijbels, I.@KU Leuven::Verhasselt, A.@Hasselt University",not exist,"Variable Selection in Varying-Coefficient Models Using P-Splines+Antoniadis, Anestis; Gijbels, Irene; Verhasselt, Anneleen+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2012::Testing monotonicity of regression+Bowman, AW; Jones, MC; Gijbels, I+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 1998::A practical guide to splines, revised version+De Boor,, C.+APPL MATH SCI+2001::Nonparametric estimation of covariance structure in longitudinal data+Diggle, PJ; Verbyla, AP+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1998::AN APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF REPEATED MEASUREMENTS+DIGGLE, PJ+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1988::Statistical methods with varying coefficient models+Fan, Jianqing; Zhang, Wenyang+STATISTICS AND ITS INTERFACE+2008::Testing monotonicity of regression+Ghosal, S; Sen, A; van der Vaart, W+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2000::VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS+HASTIE, T; TIBSHIRANI, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1993::Application of random-effects pattern-mixture models for missing data in longitudinal studies+Hedeker, D; Gibbons, RD+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 1997::Nonparametric smoothing estimates of time-varying coefficient models with longitudinal data+Hoover, DR; Rice, JA; Wu, CO; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1998::Varying-coefficient models and basis function approximations for the analysis of repeated measurements+Huang, JHZ; Wu, CO; Zhou, L+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2002::Polynomial spline estimation and inference for varying coefficient models with longitudinal data+Huang, JHZ; Wu, CO; Zhou, L+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2004::no title+Lorr, M.; Klett, C.J.+Inpatient Multi dimensional Psychiatric Scale Manual+1966::no title+Schumaker, L.+Spline functions: Basic theory+2007::no title+Silvapulle, M.

Robust and efficient direction identification for groupwise additive multiple-index models and its applications,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0496-0,MAR 2017,38,0,"This paper concerns robust and efficient direction identification for a groupwise additive multiple-index model, in which each additive function has a single-index structure. Interestingly, without involving non-parametric approach, we show that the directions of all the index parameter vectors can be recovered by a simple linear composite quantile regression (CQR). As a specific application, a iterative-free CQR estimation procedure for the partially linear single-index model is proposed. Furthermore, it can also be used to develop a penalized CQR procedure for variable selection in the high-dimensional settings. The new method has superiority in robustness and efficiency by inheriting the advantage of the CQR approach. Simulation results and real-data analysis also confirm our method.","Robust,Variable selection,High dimensionality,Index estimation,Multiple-index models","NONCONCAVE PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD,COMPOSITE QUANTILE REGRESSION,VARIABLE SELECTION,DIMENSION REDUCTION,INVERSE REGRESSION,COEFFICIENT,PREDICTORS","Wang, Kangning@Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Sch Stat, Yantai, Peoples R China@Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Dept Math & Finance, Chongqing, Peoples R China::Lin, Lu@Shandong Univ, Inst Financial Studies, Jinan, Peoples R China","Wang, Kangning@Shandong Technology & Business University@Chongqing University of Arts & Sciences::Lin, Lu@Shandong University",not exist,"Penalized composite quasi-likelihood for ultrahigh dimensional variable selection+Bradic, Jelena;

Sure screening by ranking the canonical correlations,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0497-z,MAR 2017,19,0,"The sure independence screening procedure by ranking the marginal Pearson correlation is well documented in literatures and works satisfactorily in the ultra-high dimensional case. However, this marginal Person correlation learning would easily miss the variable that is marginally uncorrelated with the response but correlated with the response jointly with some other variables. This failure in missing an important variable is due to the fact that the marginal Pearson correlation does not use the joint information of the response and a set of covariates. In this paper, we introduce a new screening method which leaves a variable into the active set if it jointly with some other variables has a high canonical correlation with the response. This is accomplished via ranking canonical correlations between the response and all possible sets of k variables. Our results show that the procedure has the sure screening property and substantially reduces the dimensionality to a moderate size against the sample size. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our new method performs substantially better than the existing sure independence screening approaches based on the marginal Pearson correlation or Kental's tau rank correlation. A real data set is also analyzed by implementing our approach.","High dimension,Correlation,Group screening","VARIABLE SELECTION,REGRESSION,MODELS,LASSO","Kong, Xin-Bing@Soochow Univ, CASER, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China::Liu, Zhi@Univ Macau, Zhuhai, Peoples R China@UM Zhuhai Res Inst, Zhuhai, Peoples R China::Yao, Yuan@Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Math, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Zhou, Wang@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore, Singapore","Kong, Xin-Bing@Suzhou University::Liu, Zhi@University of Macau::Yao, Yuan@Hong Kong Baptist University::Zhou, Wang@National University of Singapore","HKBU, Mathematics@B-5086-2009::Yao, Yuan@A-5799-2015","Regularization of wavelet approximations+Antoniadis, A; Fan, JQ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::Model-Free Feature Screening for Ultrahigh Dimenssional Discriminant Analysis+Cui, Hengjian; Li, Runze; Zhong, Wei+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2015::SURE INDEPENDENCE SCREENING IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS WITH NP-DIMENSIONALITY+Fan, Jianqing; Song, Rui+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2010::Nonparametric Independence Screening in Sparse Ultra-High-Dimensional Varying Coefficient Models+Fan, Jianqing; Ma, Yunbei; Dai, Wei+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUL 3 2014::Nonparametric Independence Screening in Sparse Ultra-High-Dimensional Additive Models+Fan, Jianqing; Feng, Yang; Song, Rui+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2011::Sure independence screening for ultrahigh dimensional feature space+Fan, Jianqing; Lv, Jinchi+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+NOV 2008::Nonconcave penalized likelihood with a diverging number of parameters+Fan, JQ; Peng, H+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::A STATISTICAL VIEW OF SOME CHEMOMETRICS REGRESSION TOOLS+FRANK, IE; FRIEDMAN, JH+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1993::Using Generalized Correlation to Effect Variable Selection in Very High Dimensional Problems+Hall, Peter; Miller, Hugh+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2009::Tilting methods for assessing the influence of components in a classifier+Hall, Peter; Titterington, D.

Distribution-free tests for sparse heterogeneous mixtures,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0499-x,MAR 2017,20,3,"We consider the problem of detecting sparse heterogeneous mixtures from a nonparametric perspective. Specifically, we assume that the null distribution is symmetric about zero, while the true effects have positive median. We then suggest two new tests for this purpose. The main one is a form of Anderson-Darling test for symmetry and is closely related to the higher criticism. It is shown to achieve the detection boundary for the normal mixture model and, more generally, for asymptotically generalized Gaussian mixture models, in all sparsity regimes. The other test is a form of longest run test and specifically designed for the very sparse situation.","Mixture detection,Distribution-free tests,Higher criticism,Anderson-Darling test,Smirnov test for symmetry",HIGHER CRITICISM,"Arias-Castro, Ery@Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Math, 9500 Gilman Dr 0112, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA::Wang, Meng@Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, 300 Pasteur Dr Alway M333, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Arias-Castro, Ery@University of California San Diego@University of California System::Wang, Meng@Stanford University",not exist,"Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays+Alon, U; Barkai, N; Notterman, DA; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+JUN 8 1999::ASYMPTOTIC THEORY OF CERTAIN GOODNESS OF FIT CRITERIA BASED ON STOCHASTIC PROCESSES+ANDERSON, TW; DARLING, DA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1952::Distribution free tests for sparse heterogeneous mixtures+ARIAS-CASTRO, E.; WANG, M.+arXiv:1308.0346+2013::GLOBAL TESTING UNDER SPARSE ALTERNATIVES: ANOVA, MULTIPLE COMPARISONS AND THE HIGHER CRITICISM+Arias-Castro, Ery; Candes, Emmanuel J.; Plan, Yaniv+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2011::Testing symmetry using a trimmed longest run statistic+Bakliz, Ayman+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2007::Optimal detection of heterogeneous and heteroscedastic mixtures+Cai, T.

Bayesian estimation of the threshold of a generalised pareto distribution for heavy-tailed observations,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0501-7,MAR 2017,45,0,"In this paper, we discuss a method to define prior distributions for the threshold of a generalised Pareto distribution, in particular when its applications are directed to heavy-tailed data. We propose to assign prior probabilities to the order statistics of a given set of observations. In other words, we assume that the threshold coincides with one of the data points. We show two ways of defining a prior: by assigning equal mass to each order statistic, that is a uniform prior, and by considering the worth that every order statistic has in representing the true threshold. Both proposed priors represent a scenario of minimal information, and we study their adequacy through simulation exercises and by analysing two applications from insurance and finance.","Extreme values,Generalised Pareto distribution,Heavy tails,Kullback-Leibler divergence,Self-information loss","EMPIRICAL BAYES,MIXTURE,MODEL,UNCERTAINTY,INFERENCE,PRIORS","Villa, Cristiano@Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury, Kent, England","Villa, Cristiano@University of Kent","Villa, Cristiano@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2670-2954","Bayesian analysis of extreme events with threshold estimation+Behrens, CN; Lopes, HF; Gamerman, D+STATISTICAL MODELLING+OCT 2004::no title+Berger, J.

Honest confidence regions and optimality in high-dimensional precision matrix estimation,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0503-5,MAR 2017,30,4,"We propose methodology for estimation of sparse precision matrices and statistical inference for their low-dimensional parameters in a high-dimensional setting where the number of parameters p can be much larger than the sample size. We show that the novel estimator achieves minimax rates in supremum norm and the low-dimensional components of the estimator have a Gaussian limiting distribution. These results hold uniformly over the class of precision matrices with row sparsity of small order and spectrum uniformly bounded, under a sub-Gaussian tail assumption on the margins of the true underlying distribution. Consequently, our results lead to uniformly valid confidence regions for low-dimensional parameters of the precision matrix. Thresholding the estimator leads to variable selection without imposing irrepresentability conditions. The performance of the method is demonstrated in a simulation study and on real data.","Precision matrix,Sparsity,Inference,Asymptotic normality,Confidence regions","INVERSE COVARIANCE ESTIMATION,LASSO,REGRESSION,INTERVALS,MODELS,SELECTION","Jankova, Jana@Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Seminar Stat, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland::van de Geer, Sara@Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Seminar Stat, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Jankova, Jana@ETH Zurich::van de Geer, Sara@ETH Zurich",not exist,"Square-root lasso: pivotal recovery of sparse signals via conic programming+Belloni, A.; Chernozhukov, V.; Wang, L.+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2011::Inference on Treatment Effects after Selection among High-Dimensional Controls(aEuro)+Belloni, Alexandre; Chernozhukov, Victor; Hansen, Christian+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 2014::no title+Bickel,, P.

Robust asymptotic tests for the equality of multivariate coefficients of variation,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0504-4,MAR 2017,34,2,"In order to easily compare several populations on the basis of more than one feature, multivariate coefficients of variation (MCV) may be used as they allow to summarize relative dispersion in a single index. However, up to date, no test of equality of one or more MCVs has been developed in the literature. In this paper, several classical and robust Wald-type tests are proposed and studied. The asymptotic distributions of the test statistics are derived under elliptical symmetry, and the asymptotic efficiency of the robust versions is compared to the classical tests. Robustness of the proposed procedures is examined through partial and joint influence functions of the test statistic, as well as by means of power and level influence functions. A simulation study compares the performance of the classical and robust tests under uncontaminated and contaminated schemes, and the difference with the usual covariance homogeneity test is highlighted. As a by-product, these tests may also be considered in the univariate context where they yield procedures that are both robust and easy-to-use. They provide an interesting alternative to the numerous parametric tests existing in the literature, which are, in most cases, unreliable in presence of outliers. The methods are illustrated on a real data set.","Multivariate coefficient of variation,Robust testing,Wald-type test,External quality assessment","COVARIANCE,DISTRIBUTIONS,ESTIMATORS,POPULATION,DIVERGENCE,EXPANSION,LOCATION,SCATTER","Aerts, Stephanie@Univ Liege ULg, HEC ULg, N1,Rue Louvrex 14, B-4000 Liege, Belgium::Haesbroeck, Gentiane@Univ Liege ULg, Polytech 1, Allee Decouverte 12, B-4000 Liege, Belgium","Aerts, Stephanie@University of Liege::Haesbroeck, Gentiane@University of Liege",not exist,"Multivariate coefficients of variation: Comparison and influence functions+Aerts, S.; Haesbroeck, G.; Ruwet, C.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+DEC 2015::Distribution under elliptical symmetry of a distance-based multivariate coefficient of variation+Aerts, S.; Haesbroeck, G.; Ruwet, C.+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 2018::A novel definition of the multivariate coefficient of variation+Albert, Adelin; Zhang, Lixin+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+OCT 2010::Generalized Wald-type tests based on minimum density power divergence estimators+Basu, A; Mandal, A; Martin, A<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Pardo, L</span>.+Statistics+2015::On an approximate test for homogeneity of coefficients of variation+Bennett, B.M.+Contributions to Applied Statistics Dedicated to A.

Maximum likelihood estimation and parameter interpretation in elliptical mixed logistic regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0507-1,MAR 2017,25,1,"We introduce the class of elliptical mixed logistic model with focus on the normal/independent subclass. Parameter interpretation in mixed logistic model is not straightforward since the odds ratio is random. For the proposed models, we obtain the odds ratio distribution and its summaries used to interpret the fixed effects and to measure the heterogeneity among the clusters thus extending previous results. Fisher information is also obtained. A Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm is considered to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates. A simulation study is performed comparing normal and heavy-tailed models. It also address the effect of the misspecification of the random effect distribution and other model aspects in the parameter interpretation. A data analysis is performed showing the utility of heavy-tailed mixed logistic model. Among the main conclusions, we note that the misspecification of the random effect distribution influences the fixed effects interpretation and the quantification of the among clusters heterogeneity.","Heavy tail,EM-type algorithm,Random odds ratio","CARLO EM ALGORITHM,EFFECTS MODELS","Santos, Cristiano C.@Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Estat, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil::Loschi, Rosangela H.@Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Estat, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil","Santos, Cristiano C.@Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais::Loschi, Rosangela H.@Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais",not exist,"Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4.

Testing for decreasing heterogeneity in a new time-varying frailty model,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0468-9,DEC 2016,26,0,"Frailty models adjust for between-cluster variability in survival data by including a cluster-specific random factor, the frailty term, in the Cox model. The frailty term is assumed to be constant over time. This assumption is questionable in some particular settings, e.g., in cancer clinical trials on chronic myeloid leukaemia. We therefore relax the time-constant heterogeneity assumption and consider frailty models with a time-varying frailty term. Instead of working with hazard models, we rather model the log cumulative hazard function, making use of the mixed model framework, and introduce a time-varying random effect at that level. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method has acceptable size and power to detect time-dependent clustering. The method is applied to data from a large-scale multicentre clinical trial in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia.","Frailty model,Linear mixed effects model,Log cumulative hazard model,Multivariate survival,Time-varying random effects","MULTIVARIATE SURVIVAL-DATA,DEPENDENT FRAILTY","Munda, Marco@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Actuarial Sci, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium::Legrand, Catherine@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Actuarial Sci, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium::Duchateau, Luc@Univ Ghent, Dept Comparat Physiol & Biometr, Fac Vet Med, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium::Janssen, Paul@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium","Munda, Marco@Universite Catholique Louvain::Legrand, Catherine@Universite Catholique Louvain::Duchateau, Luc@Ghent University::Janssen, Paul@Hasselt University",not exist,"One-sided tests in shared frailty models+Claeskens, Gerda; Nguti, Rosemary; Janssen, Paul+TEST+MAY 2008::no title+Davison, AC; Hinkley, DV.+Bootstrap Methods and Their Applications+1997::no title+Duchateau, L; Janssen, P.+The frailty model+2008::Dynamic random effects models for times between repeated events+Fong, DYT; Lam, KF; Lawless, JF; et al.+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 2001::Frailty models based on Levy processes+Gjessing, HK; Aalen, OO; Hjort, NL+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+JUN 2003::The EBMT risk score+Gratwohl, A.+BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION+JUN 2012::Modeling multivariate survival data by a semiparametric random effects proportional odds model+Lam, KF; Lee, YW; Leung, TL+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2002::Heterogeneity in disease free survival between centers: lessons learned from an EORTC breast cancer trial+Legrand, C; Duchateau, L; Sylvester, R; et al.+CLINICAL TRIALS+2006::Treatment outcome studies: pitfalls in current methods and practice+Legrand, C; Sylvester, R; Duchateau, L; et al.+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER+JUN 2002::no title+Littell, R; Milliken, G; Stroup, W<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wolfinger, R; Schabenberber, O</span>.+SAS for Mixed Models+2006::Modelling covariance strucutre in the analysis of repeated measures data+Littell, RC; Pendergast, J; Natarajan, R+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 15 2000::Continuous covariate frailty models for censored and truncated clustered data+Lopez-de-Ullibarri, Ignacio; Janssen, Paul; Cao, Ricardo+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 2012::Bayesian inference for recurrent events data using time-dependent frailty+Manda, SOM; Meyer, R+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 2005::Resampling plans for frailty models+Massonnet, G; Burzykowski, T; Janssen, P+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+APR-JUN 2006::Fitting conditional survival models to meta-analytic data by using a transformation toward mixed-effects models+Massonnet, Goele; Janssen, Paul; Burzykowski, Tomasz+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2008::A COMPARISON OF SEVERAL METHODS OF ESTIMATING THE SURVIVAL FUNCTION WHEN THERE IS EXTREME RIGHT CENSORING+MOESCHBERGER, ML; KLEIN, JP+BIOMETRICS+1985::MULTIVARIATE SURVIVAL ANALYSIS USING PIECEWISE GAMMA-FRAILTY+PAIK, MC; TSAI, WY; OTTMAN, R+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1994::Bayesian semiparametric dynamic frailty models for multiple event time data+Pennell, Michael L.; Dunson, David B.+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2006::Dynamic frailty models based on compound birth-death processes+Putter, Hein; Van Houwelingen, Hans C.+BIOSTATISTICS+JUL 2015::THE ORDERED-HETEROGENEITY FAMILY OF TESTS+RICE, WR; GAINES, SD+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1994::EXTENDING NONDIRECTIONAL HETEROGENEITY TESTS TO EVALUATE SIMPLY ORDERED ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES+RICE, WR; GAINES, SD+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+JAN 4 1994::Generalized time-dependent conditional linear models under left truncation and right censoring+Teodorescu, Bianca; Van Keilegom, Ingrid; Cao, Ricardo+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+JUN 2010::Multilevel survival modelling of recurrent urinary tract infections+Wang, Kui; Yau, Kelvin K.

Statistical inference for generalized additive models: simultaneous confidence corridors and variable selection,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0480-8,DEC 2016,36,1,"In spite of widespread use of generalized additive models (GAMs) to remedy the ""curse of dimensionality"", there is no well-grounded methodology developed for simultaneous inference and variable selection for GAM in existing literature. However, both are essential in enhancing the capability of statistical models. To this end, we establish simultaneous confidence corridors (SCCs) and a type of Bayesian information criterion (BIC) through the spline-backfitted kernel smoothing techniques proposed in recent articles. To characterize the global features of each non-parametric components, SCCs are constructed for testing their overall trends and entire shapes. By extending the BIC in additive models with identity/trivial link, an asymptotically consistent BIC approach for variable selection is built up in GAM to improve the parsimony of model without loss of prediction accuracy. Simulations and a real example corroborate the above findings.","BIC,Confidence corridor,Extreme value,Generalized additive mode,Spline-backfitted kernel","ORACALLY EFFICIENT ESTIMATION,VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,LINK FUNCTION,TIME-SERIES,SPLINE,BANDS","Zheng, Shuzhuan@Soochow Univ, Ctr Adv Stat & Econometr Res, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China@Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA::Liu, Rong@Univ Toledo, Dept Math & Stat, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA::Yang, Lijian@Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China@Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China::Haerdle, Wolfgang K.@Humboldt Univ, CASE, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany@Singapore Management Univ, Sim Kee Boon Inst Financial Econ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Business, Singapore, Singapore","Zheng, Shuzhuan@Columbia University@Suzhou University::Liu, Rong@University of Toledo::Yang, Lijian@Tsinghua University::Haerdle, Wolfgang K.@Humboldt University of Berlin@Singapore Management University","Yang, Lijian@E-1848-2011","Bankruptcy prediction by generalized additive models+Berg, Daniel+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY+MAR-APR 2007::no title+Bernhardsen, E.+A model of bankruptcy prediction+2001::SOME GLOBAL MEASURES OF DEVIATIONS OF DENSITY-FUNCTION ESTIMATES+BICKEL, PJ; ROSENBLA.M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1973::A smooth simultaneous confidence band for conditional variance function+Cai, Li; Yang, Lijian+TEST+SEP 2015::Testing rating accuracy+Engelmann, B; Hayden, E; Tasche, D.+Risk+2003::Simultaneous confidence bands and hypothesis testing in varying-coefficient models+Fan, JQ; Zhang, WY+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2000::Oracally efficient estimation for single-index link function with simultaneous confidence band+Gu, Lijie; Yang, Lijian+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2015::A simultaneous confidence corridor for varying coefficient regression with sparse functional data+Gu, Lijie; Wang, Li; Haerdle, Wolfgang K.; et al.+TEST+DEC 2014::ASYMPTOTIC MAXIMAL DEVIATION OF M-SMOOTHERS+HARDLE, W+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAY 1989::Estimation in a semiparametric model for longitudinal data with unspecified dependence structure+He, XM; Zhu, ZY; Fung, WK+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::Robust estimation in generalized partial linear models for clustered data+He, XM; Fung, WK; Zhu, ZY+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2005::Nonparametric estimation of an additive model with a link function+Horowitz, JL; Mammen, E+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2004::Identification of non-linear additive autoregressive models+Huang, JHZ; Yang, LJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::Efficient estimation of additive nonparametric regression models+Linton, OB+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1997::Estimation of additive regression models with known links+Linton, OB; Hardle, W+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1996::SPLINE-BACKFITTED KERNEL SMOOTHING OF ADDITIVE COEFFICIENT MODEL+Liu, Rong; Yang, Lijian+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+FEB 2010::Oracally Efficient Two-Step Estimation of Generalized Additive Model+Liu, Rong; Yang, Lijian; Haerdle, Wolfgang K.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2013::Spline-backfitted kernel smoothing of partially linear additive model+Ma, Shujie; Yang, Lijian+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JAN 2011::A SIMULTANEOUS CONFIDENCE BAND FOR SPARSE LONGITUDINAL REGRESSION+Ma, Shujie; Yang, Lijian; Carroll, Raymond J.+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2012::Selecting credit rating models: a cross-validation-based comparison of discriminatory power+Ryser, M; Denzler, S.+Financ Mark Portf Manag+2009::QUASI-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION IN SEMIPARAMETRIC MODELS+SEVERINI, TA; STANISWALIS, JG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1994::Explaining credit rating differences between Japanese and U.

Censored mixed-effects models for irregularly observed repeated measures with applications to HIV viral loads,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0486-2,DEC 2016,32,1,"In some acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinical trials, the human immunodeficiency virus-1 ribonucleic acid measurements are collected irregularly over time and are often subject to some upper and lower detection limits, depending on the quantification assays. Linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models, with modifications to accommodate censored observations, are routinely used to analyze this type of data (Vaida and Liu, J Comput Graph Stat 18:797-817, 2009; Matos et al., Comput Stat Data Anal 57(1):450-464, 2013a). This paper presents a framework for fitting LMEC/NLMEC with response variables recorded at irregular intervals. To address the serial correlation among the within-subject errors, a damped exponential correlation structure is considered in the random error and an EM-type algorithm is developed for computing the maximum likelihood estimates, obtaining as a byproduct the standard errors of the fixed effects and the likelihood value. The proposed methods are illustrated with simulations and the analysis of two real AIDS case studies.","Censored data,EM algorithm,HIV viral load,Irregularly observed data,Linear/nonlinear mixed models","EM ALGORITHM,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,VARIABLES,ERRORS,ASSAYS","Matos, Larissa A.@Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Estat, Cidade Univ Zeferino Vaz, Sao Paulo, Brazil::Castro, Luis M.@Univ Concepcion, Dept Stat, Concepcion, Chile@Univ Concepcion, CI2MA, Concepcion, Chile::Lachos, Victor H.@Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Estat, Cidade Univ Zeferino Vaz, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Matos, Larissa A.@Universidade Estadual de Campinas::Castro, Luis M.@Universidad de Concepcion::Lachos, Victor H.@Universidade Estadual de Campinas","Castro, Mauricio@E-9801-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7249-5207::Cepid, CeMEAI@J-2417-2015","Evaluation of the clinical sensitivities of three viral load assays with plasma samples from a pediatric population predominantly infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype G and BG recombinant forms+Antunes, R; Figueiredo, S; Bartolo, I; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY+JUL 2003::Student-t censored regression model: properties and inference+Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.; Castro, Luis M.; Gonzalez-Farias, Graciela; et al.+STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS+NOV 2012::Duration of time between exposure and seroconversion in healthcare workers with occupationally acquired infection with human immunodeficiency virus+Ciesielski, Carol A.; Metler, Russ P.+American Journal of Medicine+1997::Convergence of a stochastic approximation version of the EM algorithm+Delyon, B; Lavielle, V; Moulines, E+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 1999::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Censored linear regression models for irregularly observed longitudinal data using the multivariate-t distribution+Garay, Aldo M.; Castro, Luis M.; Leskow, Jacek; et al.+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+APR 2017::Mixed effects models with censored data with application to HIV RNA levels+Hughes, JP+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1999::Implementations of the Monte Carlo EM algorithm+Levine, RA; Casella, G+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2001::Multivariate skew-normal at linear mixed models for multi-outcome longitudinal data+Lin, Tsung-I; Wang, Wan-Lun+STATISTICAL MODELLING+JUN 2013::Robust mixture modeling using multivariate skew t distributions+Lin, Tsung-I+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUL 2010::Two-step and likelihood methods for HIV viral dynamic models with covariate measurement errors and missing data+Liu, Wei; Wu, Lang+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+2012::Congenital toxoplasmosis transmitted by human immunodeficiency-virus infected women+Lopes de Azevedo, Katia Martins; Setubal, Sergio; Silami Lopes, Vania Gloria; et al.+BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES+MAR-APR 2010::FINDING THE OBSERVED INFORMATION MATRIX WHEN USING THE EM ALGORITHM+LOUIS, TA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::Influence diagnostics in linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models with censored data+Matos, Larissa A.; Lachos, Victor H.; Balakrishnan, N.; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 2013::Influence assessment in censored mixed-effects models using the multivariate Student's-t distribution+Matos, Larissa A.; Bandyopadhyay, Dipankar; Castro, Luis M.; et al.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 2015::LIKELIHOOD-BASED INFERENCE FOR MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS WITH CENSORED RESPONSE USING THE MULTIVARIATE-t DISTRIBUTION+Matos, Larissa A.; Prates, Marcos O.; Chen, Ming-Hui; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2013::A FAST IMPROVEMENT TO THE EM ALGORITHM ON ITS OWN TERMS+MEILIJSON, I+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1989::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION VIA THE ECM ALGORITHM - A GENERAL FRAMEWORK+MENG, XL; RUBIN, DB+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1993::Censored linear model in high dimensions+Muller, P; Van de Geer, S.+Test+2015::A PARAMETRIC FAMILY OF CORRELATION STRUCTURES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF LONGITUDINAL DATA+MUNOZ, A; CAREY, V; SCHOUTEN, JP; et al.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1992::no title+PINHEIRO, J.

"Limit theorems for empirical R,nyi entropy and divergence with applications to molecular diversity analysis",TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0489-z,DEC 2016,40,0,"Quantitative methods for studying biodiversity have been traditionally rooted in the classical theory of finite frequency tables analysis. However, with the help of modern experimental tools, like high-throughput sequencing, we now begin to unlock the outstanding diversity of genomic data in plants and animals reflective of the long evolutionary history of our planet. This molecular data often defies the classical frequency/contingency tables assumptions and seems to require sparse tables with very large number of categories and highly unbalanced cell counts, e.g., following heavy-tailed distributions (for instance, power laws). Motivated by the molecular diversity studies, we propose here a frequency-based framework for biodiversity analysis in the asymptotic regime where the number of categories grows with sample size (an infinite contingency table). Our approach is rooted in information theory and based on the Gaussian limit results for the effective number of species (the Hill numbers) and the empirical Renyi entropy and divergence. We argue that when applied to molecular biodiversity analysis, our methods can properly account for the complicated data frequency patterns on one hand and the practical sample size limitations on the other. We illustrate this principle with two specific RNA sequencing examples: a comparative study of T-cell receptor populations and a validation of some preselected molecular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) markers.","Hill number,Central limit theorem,Next-generation sequencing,Triangular arrays,T-cell receptors","HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA,HILL NUMBERS,RNA-SEQ,BIODIVERSITY,INFORMATION","Pietrzak, Maciej@Ohio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Rempala, Grzegorz A.@Ohio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@Ohio State Univ, Math Biosci Inst, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Seweryn, Michal@Univ Lodz, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Lodz, Poland::Wesolowski, Jacek@Warsaw Univ Sci & Technol, Wydzial Matemat & Nauk Informacyjnych, Warsaw, Poland","Pietrzak, Maciej@Ohio State University::Rempala, Grzegorz A.@Ohio State University::Seweryn, Michal@University of Lodz::Wesolowski, Jacek@Warsaw University of Technology",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Molecular biodiversity and recent analytical developments: A marriage of convenience+Berkov, Strahil; Mutafova, Blaga; Christen, Philippe+BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES+NOV 1 2014::Save those molecules!

A moment generating function of a combination of linear rank tests and its asymptotic efficiency,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0490-6,DEC 2016,23,0,"When testing hypotheses in two-sample problems, the Lepage test has often been used to jointly test the location and scale parameters, and has been discussed by many authors over the years. The Lepage test was a combination of the Wilcoxon statistic and the Ansari-Bradley statistic. Various Lepage-type tests were proposed with discussions of an asymptotic relative efficiency (Duran et al., Biometrika 63:173-176, 1976; Goria, Stat Neerl 36:3-13, 1982), a robustness and a power comparison (Neuhauser, Commun Stat Theory Methods 29:67-78, 2000; Buning, J Appl Stat 29:907-924, 2002) and an adaptive test (Buning and Thadewald, J Stat Comput Sim 65:287-310, 2000). We derive an expression for the moment generating function of a linear combination of two linear rank statistics. As a suggested Lepage-type test, we use a combination of the generalized Wilcoxon statistic and the generalized Mood statistic. Deriving the exact critical value of the statistic can be difficult when the sample sizes are increasing. In this situation, an approximation method to the distribution function of the test statistic can be useful with a higher order moment.

Simultaneous confidence bands for the distribution function of a finite population and of its superpopulation,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0491-5,DEC 2016,26,1,"Simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) are proposed for the distribution function of a finite population and of the latent superpopulation via the empirical distribution function (nonsmooth) and kernel distribution estimator (smooth) based on a simple random sample (SRS), either with or without finite population correction. It is shown that both nonsmooth and smooth SCBs achieve asymptotically the nominal confidence level under standard assumptions. In particular, the uncorrected nonsmooth SCB for superpopulation is exactly the same as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov SCB based on an independent and identically distributed sample as long as the SRS size is infinitesimal relative to the finite population size. Extensive simulation studies confirm the asymptotic properties. As an illustration, the proposed SCBs are constructed for the population distribution of the well-known baseball data (Lohr, Sampling: design and analysis, 2nd edn.

Constrained Bayes estimation in small area models with functional measurement error,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0492-4,DEC 2016,29,0,"In survey sampling, policy decisions regarding allocation of resources to subgroups, called small areas, or determination of subgroups with specific properties in a population are based on reliable estimates of small area parameters. However, the information is often collected at a different scale than these subgroups. Hence, we need to estimate characteristics of subgroups based on the coarser scale data. One of the main interests in small area estimation is to produce an ensemble of small area parameters whose distribution across small areas is close to the corresponding distribution of true parameters. In this paper, we consider the unit-level nested error linear regression model which is commonly used in small area estimation. We study the case where the covariate in the model is assumed to have measurement error. To study this complex model, we propose to use constrained Bayes method to estimate the true covariate to build the small area Bayes predictor. We also provide some measures of performance such as sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values for the constructed Bayes predictor. We estimate the model parameters using the method of moments and Bayesian approach to get corresponding empirical and hierarchical Bayes predictors. The performance of our proposed approach is evaluated through a simulation study and a real data application.","Constrained Bayes,Empirical Bayes,Functional measurement error,Small area estimation","SERIES BENCHMARKING PROCEDURES,MIXED MODELS,POPULATION,PREDICTION,SINGLE","Torkashvand, Elaheh@Univ Manitoba, Dept Stat, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada::Jozani, Mohammad Jafari@Univ Manitoba, Dept Stat, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada::Torabi, Mahmoud@Univ Manitoba, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0W3, Canada@Univ Manitoba, Dept Stat, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0W3, Canada","Torkashvand, Elaheh@University of Manitoba::Jozani, Mohammad Jafari@University of Manitoba::Torabi, Mahmoud@University of Manitoba",not exist,"AN ERROR-COMPONENTS MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF COUNTY CROP AREAS USING SURVEY AND SATELLITE DATA+BATTESE, GE; HARTER, RM; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1988::no title+Carroll, R.

Robustness issues for CUB models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0493-3,DEC 2016,22,1,"The present paper deals with a parametric class of models implemented for ordered categorical data, denoted as cub model, which is defined as a discrete mixture of a shifted binomial and a uniform random variable. For these models, robustness issues are considered. In particular, the influence function is introduced and subsequently used to define the robustness measures for categorical data. By exploiting the peculiar parametrization of the cub models, diagnostic plots are proposed which allow to display the effect of a contamination in the data, simultaneously for all categories. The breakdown point is also considered and a computational procedure is suggested to determine an upper bound. The paper provides evidence that, despite the limited range of the support, contaminations in the data can heavily affect the inferential procedures and hence robustness topics are indeed relevant for ordinal data.","Breakdown point,cub models,Diagnostic plots,Influence function,Ordinal data,Robustness",,"Iannario, Maria@Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Naples, Italy::Monti, Anna Clara@Univ Sannio, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Benevento, Italy::Piccolo, Domenico@Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Naples, Italy","Iannario, Maria@University of Naples Federico II::Monti, Anna Clara@University of Sannio::Piccolo, Domenico@University of Naples Federico II",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of ordinal categorical data+2010::A class of statistical models for evaluating services and performances+Corduas, Marcella; Iannario, Maria; Piccolo, Domenico+STATISTICAL METHODS FOR THE EVALUATION OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS+2009::Robust estimation for ordinal regression+Croux, C.; Haesbroeck, G.; Ruwet, C.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 2013::Limit behavior of the empirical influence function of the median+Croux, C+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAR 30 1998::A mixture model for preferences data analysis+D'Elia, A; Piccolo, D+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 1 2005::Measuring job satisfaction with CUB models+Gambacorta, R; Iannario, M.+Labour+2005::no title+Hampel, F.

A contamination model for the stochastic order,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0494-2,DEC 2016,26,2,"Stochastic ordering among distributions has been considered in a variety of scenarios. However, it is often a restrictive model, not supported by the data even in cases in which the researcher tends to believe that a certain variable is somehow smaller than other. Alternatively, we propose to look at a more flexible version in which two distributions satisfy an approximate stochastic order relation if they are slightly contaminated versions of distributions for which stochastic order holds. The minimal level of contamination required for stochastic order to hold is used as a measure of deviation from exact stochastic order model. Our approach is based on the use of trimmings of probabilities. We discuss their connection to approximate stochastic order and provide theoretical support for its use in data analysis, proving uniform consistency and giving non-asymptotic bounds for the error probabilities of our tests. We provide simulation results and a case study for illustration.","Stochastic order,Contamination model,Trimmed distribution,Uniformly consistent test,Asymptotics,Bootstrap","DOMINANCE,DISTRIBUTIONS,TESTS","Alvarez-Esteban, P.

These include the determination of the optimal training sample size in the cross-validation estimation of the generalization error of computer algorithms, and in the construction of graphical methods for studying dependence patterns between two biomarkers. In this paper, we prove the uniform integrability of the ordinary least squares estimators of a linear regression model, under suitable assumptions on the design matrix and the moments of the errors. Further, we prove the convergence of the moments of the estimators to the corresponding moments of their asymptotic distribution, and study the rate of the moment convergence. The canonical central limit theorem corresponds to the simplest linear regression model. We investigate the rate of the moment convergence in canonical central limit theorem proving a sharp improvement of von Bahr's (Ann Math Stat 36:808-818, 1965) theorem.","Linear regression model,Moment convergence,Rate of convergence,Uniform integrability","CENTRAL LIMIT-THEOREM,RANDOM-VARIABLES","Afendras, Georgios@SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biostat, 811 Kimball Tower, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA@SUNY Buffalo, Jacobs Sch Med & Biomed Sci, 811 Kimball Tower, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA::Markatou, Marianthi@SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biostat, 726 Kimball Tower, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA@SUNY Buffalo, Jacobs Sch Med & Biomed Sci, 726 Kimball Tower, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA","Afendras, Georgios@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo::Markatou, Marianthi@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo",not exist,"no title+Anderson, T.

To better account for model uncertainty, we propose an objective Bayesian approach to follow-up designs, using prior distributions suitably tailored to model selection. To select the best follow-up runs, we adopt a model discrimination criterion based on a weighted average of Kullback-Leibler divergences between predictive distributions for all possible pairs of models. Our procedure should appeal to practitioners because it does not require prior specifications, being fully automatic. When applied to real data, it produces follow-up runs which better discriminate among factors relative to current methodology.","Bayesian design of experiments,Bayesian model selection,Kullback-Leibler divergence,Non-informative prior,Screening experiment","VARIABLE-SELECTION,PRIORS","Consonni, Guido@Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Stat, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy::Deldossi, Laura@Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Stat, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy","Consonni, Guido@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart::Deldossi, Laura@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart","CONSONNI, Guido@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1252-5926","no title+Abramowitz, M; Stegun, IA.+NBS APPL MATH SERIES+1964::no title+Barrios Zamudio, E.+Using the BsMD package for Bayesian screening and model discrimination+2013::CRITERIA FOR BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE WITH APPLICATION TO VARIABLE SELECTION+Bayarri, M.

Efficient estimation for marginal generalized partially linear single-index models with longitudinal data,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0462-2,SEP 2016,35,1,"We consider marginal generalized partially linear single-index models for longitudinal data. A profile generalized estimating equations (GEE)-based approach is proposed to estimate unknown regression parameters. Within a wide range of bandwidths for estimating the nonparametric function, our profile GEE estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal even if the covariance structure is misspecified. Moreover, if the covariance structure is correctly specified, the semiparametric efficiency can be achieved under heteroscedasticity and without distributional assumptions on the covariates. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed procedure. The proposed methodology is further illustrated through a data analysis.","Generalized partially single-index models,Generalized estimating equations,Longitudinal data,Semiparametric efficiency","QUADRATIC INFERENCE FUNCTIONS,EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD,REGRESSION-MODELS,SELECTION,SUBJECT","Xu, Peirong@Southeast Univ, Dept Math, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China::Zhang, Jun@Shenzhen Univ, Shen Zhen Hong Kong Joint Res Ctr Appl Stat Sci, Inst Stat Sci, Coll Math & Stat, Shenzhen, Peoples R China::Huang, Xingfang@Southeast Univ, Dept Math, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China::Wang, Tao@Yale Univ, Dept Biostat, Yale Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT USA","Xu, Peirong@Southeast University - China::Zhang, Jun@Shenzhen University::Huang, Xingfang@Southeast University - China::Wang, Tao@Yale University","Zhang, Jun@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4332-5182","Penalized quadratic inference functions for single-index models with longitudinal data+Bai, Yang; Fung, Wing K.; Zhu, Zhong Yi+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2009::no title+Bickel,, P.; Klaasen,, C.; Ritov,, Y.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wellner,, J</span>.+Efficient and Adaptive Inference in Semiparametric Models+1993::Longitudinal variable selection by cross-validation in the case of many covariates+Cantoni, E.; Field, C.; Flemming, J.

Distribution-free high-dimensional two-sample tests based on discriminating hyperplanes,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0467-x,SEP 2016,34,4,"In this article, we propose a general procedure for multivariate generalizations of univariate distribution-free tests involving two independent samples as well as matched pair data. This proposed procedure is based on ranks of real-valued linear functions of multivariate observations. The linear function used to rank the observations is obtained by solving a classification problem between the two multivariate distributions from which the observations are generated. Our proposed tests retain the distribution-free property of their univariate analogs, and they perform well for high-dimensional data even when the dimension exceeds the sample size. Asymptotic results on their power properties are derived when the dimension grows to infinity and the sample size may or may not grow with the dimension. We analyze several high-dimensional simulated and real data sets to compare the empirical performance of our proposed tests with several other tests available in the literature.","Distance-weighted discrimination,Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic,Sign test,Signed rank test,Support vector machines,Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic","MULTIVARIATE RANK-TESTS,DISTANCE-WEIGHTED DISCRIMINATION,FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,SIGN TESTS,INTERDIRECTIONS,VECTOR","Ghosh, Anil K.@Indian Stat Inst, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India::Biswas, Munmun@Indian Stat Inst, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India","Ghosh, Anil K.@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute::Biswas, Munmun@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute",not exist,"Effect of high dimension: By an example of a two sample problem+Bai, ZD; Saranadasa, H+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 1996::On a new multivariate two-sample test+Baringhaus, L; Franz, C+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2004::The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency+Benjamini, Y; Yekutieli, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2001::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Some theory for Fisher's linear discriminant function, 'naive Bayes', and some alternatives when there are many more variables than observations+Bickel, PJ; Levina, E+BERNOULLI+DEC 2004::ON SOME EXACT DISTRIBUTION-FREE ONE-SAMPLE TESTS FOR HIGH DIMENSION LOW SAMPLE SIZE DATA+Biswas, Munmun; Mukhopadhyay, Minerva; Ghosh, Anil K.+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2015::SIGN TESTS IN MULTIDIMENSION - INFERENCE BASED ON THE GEOMETRY OF THE DATA CLOUD+CHAUDHURI, P; SENGUPTA, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1993::A TWO-SAMPLE TEST FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA WITH APPLICATIONS TO GENE-SET TESTING+Chen, Song Xi; Qin, Ying-Li+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2010::An approach to multivariate rank tests in multivariate analysis of variance+Choi, K; Marden, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::A simple multiway ANOVA for functional data+Cuesta-Albertos, J.

Empirical best prediction under area-level Poisson mixed models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0469-8,SEP 2016,24,6,"The paper studies the applicability of area-level Poisson mixed models to estimate small area counting indicators. Among the available procedures for fitting generalized linear models, the method of moments (MM) and the penalised quasi-likelihood (PQL) method are employed. The empirical best predictor (EBP) of the area mean is derived using MM and compared with plug-in alternatives using MM and PQL. The plug-in estimator using PQL is computationally faster and provides competitive performance with respect to EBP that involves high complex integrals. An approximation to the mean squared error (MSE) of the EBP is given and three MSE estimators are proposed. The first two MSE estimators are plug-in estimators without and with bias correction to the second order and the third one is based on parametric bootstrap. Several simulation experiments are carried out for analysing the behaviour of the EBP and for comparing the estimators of the MSE of the EBP. A good choice in practice is the bootstrap alternative since it performs similarly to the analytical versions and is computationally faster. The developed methodology and software are applied to data from the 2008 Spanish living condition survey. The target of the application is the estimation of poverty rates at province level.","Bootstrap,Empirical best predictor,Mean squared error,Method of moments,Poisson mixed models,Poverty","MEAN SQUARED ERROR,LABOR-FORCE INDICATORS,INFERENCE,ESTIMATORS,LIKELIHOOD,CENSUS,TIME","Boubeta, Miguel@Univ A Coruna, Fac Informat, La Coruna, Spain::Jose Lombardia, Maria@Univ A Coruna, Fac Informat, La Coruna, Spain::Morales, Domingo@Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Ctr Invest Operativa, Elche, Spain","Boubeta, Miguel@Universidade da Coruna::Jose Lombardia, Maria@Universidade da Coruna::Morales, Domingo@Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche","Boubeta, Miguel@D-1935-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5128-7027::Lombardia, Maria Jose@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9452-9818","APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Small area estimation of poverty proportions under area-level time models+Esteban, M.

Nonparametric density and survival function estimation in the multiplicative censoring model,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0479-1,SEP 2016,12,4,"Consider the multiplicative censoring model given by , where are i.i.d. with unknown density f on , are i.i.d. with uniform distribution and and are independent sequences. Only the sample is observed. We study nonparametric estimators of both the density f and the corresponding survival function . First, kernel estimators are built. Pointwise risk bounds for the quadratic risk are given, and upper and lower bounds for the rates in this setting are provided. Then, in a global setting, a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure is proposed. The resulting estimator has been proved to be adaptive in the sense that its risk automatically realizes the bias-variance compromise. Second, when the s are nonnegative, using kernels fitted for -supported functions, we propose new estimators of the survival function which are also adaptive. By simulation experiments, we check the good performances of the estimators and compare the two strategies.","Adaptive procedure,Bandwidth selection,Kernel estimators,Multiplicative censoring model","LARGE-SAMPLE,BIAS","Brunel, Elodie@Univ Montpellier, UMR CNRS 5149 I3M, Montpellier, France::Comte, Fabienne@Univ Paris 05, MAP5, UMR CNRS 8145, Paris, France::Genon-Catalot, Valentine@Univ Paris 05, MAP5, UMR CNRS 8145, Paris, France","Brunel, Elodie@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)@Universite de Montpellier::Comte, Fabienne@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@University of Paris Descartes@Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite-USPC (ComUE)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Genon-Catalot, Valentine@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@University of Paris Descartes@Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite-USPC (ComUE)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)",not exist,"MULTIPLICATIVE CENSORING: ESTIMATION OF A DENSITY AND ITS DERIVATIVES UNDER THE L-p-RISK+Abbaszadeh, Mohammad; Chesneau, Christophe; Doosti, Hassan+REVSTAT-STATISTICAL JOURNAL+NOV 2013::Nonparametric estimation of density under bias and multiplicative censoring via wavelet methods+Abbaszadeh, Mohammad; Chesneau, Christophe; Doosti, Hassan+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 2012::Multiplicative censoring: density estimation by a series expansion approach+Andersen, KE; Hansen, MB+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 2001::LARGE-SAMPLE STUDY OF THE KERNEL DENSITY ESTIMATORS UNDER MULTIPLICATIVE CENSORING+Asgharian, Masoud; Carone, Marco; Fakoor, Vahid+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2012::Improving point and interval estimators of monotone functions by rearrangement+Chernozhukov, V.; Fernandez-Val, I.; Galichon, A.+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2009::Wavelet Estimation of a Density in a GARCH-type Model+Chesneau, Christophe+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+JAN 1 2013::Convolution power kernels for density estimation+Comte, F.; Genon-Catalot, V.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 2012::MONOTONE PIECEWISE CUBIC INTERPOLATION+FRITSCH, FN; CARLSON, RE+SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS+1980::Nonparametric estimators+Tsybakov, Alexandre B.+INTRODUCTION TO NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION+2009::Survival analysis under cross-sectional sampling: length bias and multiplicative censoring+van Es, B; Klaassen, CAJ; Oudshoorn, K+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 1 2000::LARGE SAMPLE STUDY OF EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN A RANDOM-MULTIPLICATIVE CENSORING MODEL+VARDI, Y; ZHANG, CH+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1992::MULTIPLICATIVE CENSORING, RENEWAL PROCESSES, DECONVOLUTION AND DECREASING DENSITY - NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION+VARDI, Y+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1989"
A random forest guided tour,TEST,10.1007/s11749-016-0481-7,JUN 2016,101,19,"The random forest algorithm, proposed by L. Breiman in 2001, has been extremely successful as a general-purpose classification and regression method. The approach, which combines several randomized decision trees and aggregates their predictions by averaging, has shown excellent performance in settings where the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations. Moreover, it is versatile enough to be applied to large-scale problems, is easily adapted to various ad hoc learning tasks, and returns measures of variable importance. The present article reviews the most recent theoretical and methodological developments for random forests. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical forces driving the algorithm, with special attention given to the selection of parameters, the resampling mechanism, and variable importance measures. This review is intended to provide non-experts easy access to the main ideas.","Random forests,Randomization,Resampling,Parameter tuning,Variable importance","MACHINE LEARNING-METHODS,PROBABILITY ESTIMATION,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,VARIABLE IMPORTANCE,GENE SELECTION,CLASSIFICATION,TREES,CONSISTENCY,RANKING,CONVERGENCE","Biau, Gerard@Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, LSTA, Boite 158,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France@Inst Univ France, Paris, France::Scornet, Erwan@Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, LSTA, Boite 158,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France","Biau, Gerard@Institut Universitaire de France@Sorbonne Universite@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Scornet, Erwan@Sorbonne Universite@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)",not exist,"Enriched random forests+Amaratunga, Dhammika; Cabrera, Javier; Lee, Yung-Seop+BIOINFORMATICS+SEP 15 2008::Empirical characterization of random forest variable importance measures+Archer, Kelfie J.; Kirnes, Ryan V.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 10 2008::Analysis of purely random forests bias.

We show that such a quantification is possible for a simple pure forest, leading to conclusions that could apply more generally.

Robust estimation in generalized linear models: the density power divergence approach,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0445-3,JUN 2016,23,6,"The generalized linear model is a very important tool for analyzing real data in several application domains where the relationship between the response and explanatory variables may not be linear or the distributions may not be normal in all the cases. Quite often such real data contain a significant number of outliers in relation to the standard parametric model used in the analysis; in such cases inference based on the maximum likelihood estimator could be unreliable. In this paper, we develop a robust estimation procedure for the generalized linear models that can generate robust estimators with little loss in efficiency. We will also explore two particular special cases in detail-Poisson regression for count data and logistic regression for binary data. We will also illustrate the performance of the proposed estimators through some real-life examples.","Density power divergence,Generalized linear model,Logistic regression,Poisson regression,Robustness","TUNING PARAMETER,REGRESSION,INFERENCE,RESPONSES","Ghosh, Abhik@Indian Stat Inst, Interdisciplinary Stat Res Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India::Basu, Ayanendranath@Indian Stat Inst, Interdisciplinary Stat Res Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India","Ghosh, Abhik@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute::Basu, Ayanendranath@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute","Ghosh, Abhik@A-7388-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3688-4584","Robust Inference in the Negative Binomial Regression Model with an Application to Falls Data+Aeberhard, William H.; Cantoni, Eva; Heritier, Stephane+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2014::Robust and efficient estimation by minimising a density power divergence+Basu, A; Harris, IR; Hjort, NL; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::Robust estimation in the logistic regression model: Missing links+BIANCO, A.

We propose a Kolmogorov-Smirnov and a Cram,r-von Mises type test statistic, which measure the distance between the distribution of estimated under the null hypothesis and the distribution of without making use of this null hypothesis. The estimated distributions are based on a profile likelihood estimator of and a local polynomial estimator of . The limiting distributions of these two test statistics are established under the null hypothesis and under a local alternative.

On optimum life-testing plans under Type-II progressive censoring scheme using variable neighborhood search algorithm,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0449-z,JUN 2016,20,4,"In determination of optimum Type-II progressive censoring scheme, the experimenter needs to carry out an exhaustive search within the set of all admissible censoring schemes. The existing recommendations are only applicable for small sample sizes. The implementation of exhaustive search techniques for large sample sizes is not feasible in practice. In this article, a meta-heuristic algorithm based on variable neighborhood search approach is proposed for large sample sizes. It is found that the algorithm gives exactly the same solution for small sample sizes as the solution obtained in an exhaustive search; however, for large sample sizes, it gives near-optimum solution. We have proposed a cost function-based optimum criterion, which is scale invariant for location-scale and log-location-scale families of distribution. A sensitivity analysis is also considered to study the effect of misspecification of parameter values or cost coefficients on the optimum solution.","Cost function,Information matrix,Meta-heuristic algorithm,Near-optimum solution,Quantile,Scale invariant,Sensitivity analysis","COST FUNCTION,OPTIMALITY","Bhattacharya, Ritwik@Indian Stat Inst, SQC & OR Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India::Pradhan, Biswabrata@Indian Stat Inst, SQC & OR Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India::Dewanji, Anup@Indian Stat Inst, Appl Stat Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India","Bhattacharya, Ritwik@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute::Pradhan, Biswabrata@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute::Dewanji, Anup@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute",not exist,"Art of Progressive Censoring: Applications to Reliability and Quality+Balakrishnan, N; Cramer, E+ART OF PROGRESSIVE CENSORING: APPLICATIONS TO RELIABILITY AND QUALITY+2014::no title+Balakrishnan, N.; Aggarwala, R.+Progressive Censoring: Theory, Methods, Applications+2000::Progressive censoring methodology: an appraisal+Balakrishnan, N.+TEST+AUG 2007::Optimum life testing plans in presence of hybrid censoring: A cost function approach+Bhattacharya, R.; Pradhan, B.; Dewanji, A.+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY+SEP-OCT 2014::On optimum life testing plans under Type-II progressive censoring scheme via variable neighborhood search algorithm+Bhattacharya, R; Pradhan, B; Dewanji, A.+Tech.

Recently, there has been interest in looking at circular data collected separately over time and over space. Here, we extend some of this work to the spatio-temporal setting, introducing space-time dependence. We accommodate covariates, implement full kriging and forecasting, and also allow for a nugget which can be time dependent. We work within a Bayesian framework, introducing suitable latent variables to facilitate Markov chain Monte Carlo model fitting. The Bayesian framework enables us to implement full inference, obtaining predictive distributions for kriging and forecasting. We offer comparison between the less flexible but more interpretable wrapped Gaussian process and the more flexible but less interpretable projected Gaussian process. We do this illustratively using both simulated data and data from computer model output for wave directions in the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Italy.","Average prediction error,Continuous ranked probability score,Kriging,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Projected distribution,Wrapped distribution","MEDITERRANEAN AREA,REGRESSION-MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS,FORECAST,SYSTEM","Mastrantonio, Gianluca@Roma Tre Univ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy::Lasinio, Giovanna Jona@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke Univ, 223-A Old Chem Bldg,Box 90251, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Mastrantonio, Gianluca@Roma Tre University::Lasinio, Giovanna Jona@Sapienza University Rome::Gelfand, Alan E.@Duke University","mastrantonio, gianluca@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2963-6729::Jona Lasinio, Giovanna@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8912-5018","no title+Banerjee, S.; Carlin, B.P.; Gelfand, A.E.+Hierarchical modeling and analysis for spatial data+2014::The analysis of directional time series: Applications to wind speed and direction+Breckling, J.+LECT NOTES STAT+1989::A Multivariate Hidden Markov Model for the Identification of Sea Regimes from Incomplete Skewed and Circular Time Series+Bulla, J.; Lagona, F.; Maruotti, A.; et al.+JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS+DEC 2012::Inference for circular distributions and processes+Coles, S+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JUN 1998::REGRESSION-MODELS FOR AN ANGULAR RESPONSE+FISHER, NI; LEE, AJ+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1992::The continuous ranked probability score for circular variables and its application to mesoscale forecast ensemble verification+Grimit, E.

Bernstein estimation for a copula derivative with application to conditional distribution and regression functionals,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0459-x,JUN 2016,27,2,"Bernstein estimators attracted considerable attention as smooth nonparametric estimators for distribution functions, densities, copulas and copula densities. The present paper adds a parallel result for the first-order derivative of a copula function. This result then leads to Bernstein estimators for a conditional distribution function and its important functionals such as the regression and quantile functions. Results of independent interest have been derived such as an almost sure oscillation behavior of the empirical copula process and a Bahadur-type almost sure asymptotic representation for the Bernstein estimator of a regression quantile function. Simulations demonstrate the good performance of the proposed estimators.","Asymptotic normality,Asymptotic representation,Bernstein estimation,Copula,Copula density,Oscillation of empirical copula process,Quantile function","LOCAL LINEAR-REGRESSION,DENSITY-FUNCTION,BANDWIDTH SELECTION,SMOOTH ESTIMATION,POLYNOMIALS,BEHAVIOR","Janssen, Paul@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Hasselt, Belgium::Swanepoel, Jan@North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa::Veraverbeke, Noel@Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat, Hasselt, Belgium@North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa","Janssen, Paul@Hasselt University::Swanepoel, Jan@North West University - South Africa::Veraverbeke, Noel@North West University - South Africa@Hasselt University","Swanepoel, Jan@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2065-6483","Application of Bernstein Polynomials for smooth estimation of a distribution and density function+Babu, GJ; Canty, AJ; Chaubey, YP+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 2002::Smooth estimation of a distribution and density function on a hypercube using Bernstein polynomials for dependent random vectors+Babu, GJ; Chaubey, YP+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 1 2006::RATE OF CONVERGENCE OF BERNSTEIN POLYNOMIALS FOR FUNCTIONS WITH DERIVATIVES OF BOUNDED VARIATION+BOJANIC, R; CHENG, F+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS+JUL 1989::Bernstein estimator for unbounded density function+Bouezmarni, T.; Rolin, J.

Robust mixture regression modeling based on scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0460-4,JUN 2016,59,1,"The traditional estimation of mixture regression models is based on the assumption of normality (symmetry) of component errors and thus is sensitive to outliers, heavy-tailed errors and/or asymmetric errors. In this work we present a proposal to deal with these issues simultaneously in the context of the mixture regression by extending the classic normal model by assuming that the random errors follow a scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions. This approach allows us to model data with great flexibility, accommodating skewness and heavy tails. The main virtue of considering the mixture regression models under the class of scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions is that they have a nice hierarchical representation which allows easy implementation of inference. We develop a simple EM-type algorithm to perform maximum likelihood inference of the parameters of the proposed model. In order to examine the robust aspect of this flexible model against outlying observations, some simulation studies are also presented. Finally, a real data set is analyzed, illustrating the usefulness of the proposed method.","EM algorithm,Finite mixtures of regression models,Scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions","T-DISTRIBUTION,LINEAR REGRESSIONS,EM-ALGORITHM,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,FINITE MIXTURES,INFERENCE,VARIANCE,DENSITY","Zeller, Camila B.@Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Dept Estat, Cidade Univ, Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil::Cabral, Celso R.

Probability-enhanced effective dimension reduction for classifying sparse functional data,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0470-2,MAR 2016,98,4,"We consider the classification of sparse functional data that are often encountered in longitudinal studies and other scientific experiments. To utilize the information from not only the functional trajectories but also the observed class labels, we propose a probability-enhanced method achieved by weighted support vector machine based on its Fisher consistency property to estimate the effective dimension reduction space. Since only a few measurements are available for some, even all, individuals, a cumulative slicing approach is suggested to borrow information across individuals. We provide justification for validity of the probability-based effective dimension reduction space, and a straightforward implementation that yields a low-dimensional projection space ready for applying standard classifiers. The empirical performance is illustrated through simulated and real examples, particularly in contrast to classification results based on the prominent functional principal component analysis.","Classification,Cumulative slicing,Effective dimension reduction,Sparse functional data,Weighted support vector machine","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES,SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION,PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS,LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS,MIXED EFFECTS MODELS,LINEAR-REGRESSION,CLASSIFICATION,CURVES,SPACE,REGISTRATION","Yao, Fang@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada::Wu, Yichao@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, 2311 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Zou, Jialin@Univ Toronto, Dept Stat Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada","Yao, Fang@University of Toronto::Wu, Yichao@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::Zou, Jialin@University of Toronto",not exist,"Theoretical foundations of the potential function method in pattern recognition learning+Aizerman, A.; Braverman, E.; Rozonoer, L.+Automat.

On quantitative trait locus mapping with an interference phenomenon,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0349-z,JUN 2014,29,2,"We consider the likelihood ratio test (LRT) process related to the test of the absence of QTL (a QTL denotes a gene with quantitative effect on a trait) on the interval [0, T] representing a chromosome. The observation is the trait and the composition of the genome at some locations called ""markers"". We focus on the interference phenomenon, i.e. a recombination event inhibits the formation of another recombination event nearby. We give the asymptotic distribution of the LRT process under the null hypothesis that there is no QTL on [0, T] and under local alternatives with a QTL at on [0, T]. We show that the LRT process is asymptotically the square of a ""linear interpolated and normalized process"". We prove that under the null hypothesis, the distribution of the maximum of the LRT process is the same for a model with or without interference. However, the powers of detection are totally different between the two models.","Quantitative trait locus detection,Likelihood ratio test,Gaussian process,Chi-square process","LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST,ASYMPTOTIC-DISTRIBUTION,CHIASMA INTERFERENCE,GENE DETECTION,RECOMBINATION,PARAMETER,MIXTURES,POWER","Rabier, Charles-Elie@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Med Sci Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA@Univ Toulouse, Inst Math Toulouse, UPS, Toulouse, France@INRA, UR631, Stn Ameliorat Genet Anim, Auzeville, France","Rabier, Charles-Elie@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System@Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier@Universite de Toulouse@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)",not exist,"no title+AZAIS, J.

Local robust and asymptotically unbiased estimation of conditional Pareto-type tails,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0350-6,JUN 2014,23,3,"We introduce a non-parametric robust and asymptotically unbiased estimator for the tail index of a conditional Pareto-type response distribution in presence of random covariates. The estimator is obtained from local fits of the extended Pareto distribution to the relative excesses over a high threshold using an adjusted minimum density power divergence estimation technique. We derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator under some mild regularity conditions, and also investigate its finite sample performance with a small simulation experiment. The practical applicability of the methodology is illustrated on a dataset of calcium content measurements of soil samples.","Pareto-type distribution,Tail index,Bias-correction,Density power divergence,Local estimation","DENSITY POWER DIVERGENCE,DISTRIBUTIONS,INDEX,EXPONENT","Dierckx, Goedele@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Res Ctr Math Econ Econometr & Stat, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium::Goegebeur, Yuri@Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Math & Comp Sci, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark::Guillou, Armelle@Univ Strasbourg, Inst Rech Math Avancee, UMR 7501, F-67084 Strasbourg, France@CNRS, F-67084 Strasbourg, France","Dierckx, Goedele@KU Leuven::Goegebeur, Yuri@University of Southern Denmark::Guillou, Armelle@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Universite de Strasbourg@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes",not exist,"Robust and efficient estimation by minimising a density power divergence+Basu, A; Harris, IR; Hjort, NL; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::Tail index estimation and an exponential regression model+Beirlant, J.; Dierckx, G.; Goegebeur, Y.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Matthys, G</span>.+Extremes+1999::Local polynomial maximum likelihood estimation for Pareto-type distributions+Beirlant, J; Goegebeur, Y+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+APR 2004::Statistics of Extremes: Theory and Applications+Beirlant, J.; Goegebeur, Y.; Teugels, J.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Segers, J</span>.+WILEY SERIES PROBABI+2004::Second-order refined peaks-over-threshold modelling for heavy-tailed distributions+Beirlant, Jan; Joossens, Elisabeth; Segers, Johan+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 2009::A LIMITED MEMORY ALGORITHM FOR BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION+BYRD, RH; LU, PH; NOCEDAL, J; et al.+SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING+SEP 1995::On kernel smoothing for extremal quantile regression+Daouia, Abdelaati; Gardes, Laurent; Girard, Stephane+BERNOULLI+NOV 2013::Kernel estimators of extreme level curves+Daouia, Abdelaati; Gardes, Laurent; Girard, Stephane; et al.+TEST+AUG 2011::An asymptotically unbiased minimum density power divergence estimator for the Pareto-tail index+Dierckx, Goedele; Goegebeur, Yuri; Guillou, Armelle+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 2013::Estimating a tail exponent by modelling departure from a Pareto distribution+Feuerverger, A; Hall, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1999::A new class of semi-parametric estimators of the second order parameter+Fraga Alves, MI; Gomes, MI; de Haan, L.+Port Math.+2003::Quality assessment of pedochemical data using extreme value methodology.+Goegebeur, Y.; Planchon, V.; Beirlant, J.; et al.+Journal of Applied Sciences+2005::Nonparametric regression estimation of conditional tails-the random covariate case+Goegebeur, Y; Guillou, A; Schorgen, A.+Statistics+2013::IMPROVING SECOND ORDER REDUCED BIAS EXTREME VALUE INDEX ESTIMATION+Gomes, M.

On consistency factors and efficiency of robust S-estimators,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0357-7,JUN 2014,41,6,"We tackle the problem of obtaining the consistency factors of robust S-estimators of location and scale both in regression and multivariate analysis. We provide theoretical results, proving new formulae for their calculation and shedding light on the relationship between these factors and important statistical properties of S-estimators. We also give computational advances, suggesting efficient procedures so that hardly any time is lost for their calculation when computing S-estimates. In addition, when the purpose is to fix the efficiency of the scale estimator, we are able to quantify to what extent the approximate algorithms which are currently available provide an acceptable solution, and when it is necessary to resort to the exact formulae. Finally, even if this paper concentrates on S-estimates and Tukey's Biweight and optimal loss functions, the main results can be easily extended to calculate the tuning consistency factors for other popular loss function and other robust estimators.","Asymptotic variance,Biweight function,Breakdown point,Elliptical truncation,Mahalanobis distance,Robust regression","MULTIVARIATE LOCATION,SCATTER,REGRESSION,OPTIMALITY,ALGORITHM,MATRICES","Riani, Marco@Univ Parma, Dipartimento Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy::Cerioli, Andrea@Univ Parma, Dipartimento Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy::Torti, Francesca@Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, I-21020 Ispra, Italy","Riani, Marco@University of Parma::Cerioli, Andrea@University of Parma::Torti, Francesca@EC JRC ISPRA Site@European Commission Joint Research Centre","Riani, Marco@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7886-2207","no title+Atkinson, A.

This paper is devoted to study the empirical characteristic function process of the residuals. Specifically, it is shown that such process uniformly converges to the population characteristic function (CF) of the innovations in compact sets. The weak convergence of this empirical process, suitably normalized, is also studied. The limit depends on the population CF of the innovations, the equation defining the GARCH model and the parameter estimators employed to calculate the residuals. Applications of the obtained results for testing symmetry and goodness-of-fit to the law of the innovations are given.","GARCH,Residuals,Empirical characteristic function,Symmetry,Goodness-of-fit,Bootstrap","OF-FIT TESTS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,CAUCHY DISTRIBUTION,ERROR DISTRIBUTION,TIME-SERIES,DISTRIBUTIONS,CONVERGENCE,INNOVATIONS,PARAMETERS,EFFICIENCY","Jimenez Gamero, M.

Space-time wind speed forecasting for improved power system dispatch,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0351-0,MAR 2014,36,15,"To support large-scale integration of wind power into electric energy systems, state-of-the-art wind speed forecasting methods should be able to provide accurate and adequate information to enable efficient, reliable, and cost-effective scheduling of wind power. Here, we incorporate space-time wind forecasts into electric power system scheduling. First, we propose a modified regime-switching, space-time wind speed forecasting model that allows the forecast regimes to vary with the dominant wind direction and with the seasons, hence avoiding a subjective choice of regimes. Then, results from the wind forecasts are incorporated into a power system economic dispatch model, the cost of which is used as a loss measure of the quality of the forecast models. This, in turn, leads to cost-effective scheduling of system-wide wind generation. Potential economic benefits arise from the system-wide generation of cost savings and from the ancillary service cost savings. We illustrate the economic benefits using a test system in the northwest region of the United States. Compared with persistence and autoregressive models, our model suggests that cost savings from integration of wind power could be on the scale of tens of millions of dollars annually in regions with high wind penetration, such as Texas and the Pacific northwest.","Correlation,Cost savings,Power system economic dispatch,Space-time statistical model,Wind energy,Wind speed forecasting","CONSTRAINED UNIT COMMITMENT,GENERATION,INTEGRATION,ENERGY","Zhu, Xinxin@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Stat, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Genton, Marc G.@King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, CEMSE Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia::Gu, Yingzhong@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Xie, Le@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Zhu, Xinxin@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System::Genton, Marc G.@King Abdullah University of Science & Technology::Gu, Yingzhong@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System::Xie, Le@Texas A&M University College Station@Texas A&M University System","Genton, Marc Georges@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6467-2998","Wind Power in Power Systems+no author+WIND POWER IN POWER SYSTEMS+2005::Stochastic security for operations planning with significant wind power generation+Bouffard, F.; Galiana, F.

Assessing mean and median filters in multiple testing for large-scale imaging data,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0341-7,MAR 2014,12,0,"A new multiple testing procedure, called the FDR (L) procedure, was proposed by Zhang et al. (Ann Stat 39:613-642, 2011) for detecting the presence of spatial signals for large-scale 2D and 3D imaging data. In contrast to the conventional multiple testing procedure, the FDR (L) procedure substitutes each p-value by a locally aggregated median filter of p-values. This paper examines the performance of another commonly used filter, mean filter, in the FDR (L) procedure. It is demonstrated that when the p-values are independent and uniformly distributed under the true null hypotheses, (i) in view of estimating the resulting false discovery rate, the mean filter better alleviates the ""lack of identification phenomenon"" of the FDR (L) procedure than the median filter; (ii) in view of signal detection, the median filter enjoys the ""edge-preserving property"" and lends support to its better performance in detecting sparse signals than the mean filter.","Brain fMRI,False discovery rate,Median,p-value,Sensitivity,Specificity",,"Zhang, Chunming@Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Zhang, Chunming@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison",not exist,"DOES MEDIAN FILTERING TRULY PRESERVE EDGES BETTER THAN LINEAR FILTERING?+Arias-Castro, Ery; Donoho, David L.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2009::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::STATISTICAL USES OF THE SPATIAL MEDIAN+BROWN, BM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1983::no title+Efron, B.+Large-Scale Inference: Empirical Bayes Methods for Estimation, Testing, and Prediction+2010::no title+Feller, W.+An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications+1968::80.52 an algebraic identity leading to Wilson's theorem+Ruiz, S.+Math.

Empirical likelihood for least absolute relative error regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0343-5,MAR 2014,20,6,"Multiplicative regression models are useful for analyzing data with positive responses, such as wages, stock prices and lifetimes, that are particularly common in economic, financial, epidemiological and social studies. Recently, the least absolute relative error (LARE) estimation was proposed to be a useful alternative to the conventional least squares (LS) or least absolute deviation (LAD). However, one may resort to the time-consuming resampling methods for the inference of the LARE estimation. This paper proposes an empirical likelihood approach towards constructing confidence intervals/regions of the regression parameters for the multiplicative models. The major advantage of the proposal is its ability of internal studentizing to avoid density estimation. And it is computationally fast. Simulation studies investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method. An analysis of the body fat data is presented to illustrate the new method.","Empirical likelihood,Multiplicative regression model,Relative error estimation","PREDICTION,MODELS,INFERENCE,EQUATION","Li, Zhouping@Lanzhou Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China::Lin, Yuanyuan@Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Zhou, Guoliang@Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Accounting & Finance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China::Zhou, Wang@Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore 117548, Singapore","Li, Zhouping@Lanzhou University::Lin, Yuanyuan@Hong Kong Polytechnic University::Zhou, Guoliang@Shanghai University of Finance & Economics::Zhou, Wang@National University of Singapore",not exist,"Quantile inference for near-integrated autoregressive time series with infinite variance+Chan, NH; Peng, LA; Qi, YC+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2006::Analysis of least absolute deviation+Chen, Kani; Ying, Zhiliang; Zhang, Hong; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2008::Least Absolute Relative Error Estimation+Chen, Kani; Guo, Shaojun; Lin, Yuanyuan; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2010::A review on empirical likelihood methods for regression+Chen, Song Xi; Van Keilegom, Ingrid+TEST+NOV 2009::BOOTSTRAPPING A REGRESSION EQUATION - SOME EMPIRICAL RESULTS+FREEDMAN, DA; PETERS, SC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1984::Rank-based inference for the accelerated failure time model+Jin, ZZ; Lin, DY; Wei, LJ; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2003::PREDICTING SOFTWARE ERRORS, DURING DEVELOPMENT, USING NONLINEAR-REGRESSION MODELS - A COMPARATIVE-STUDY+KHOSHGOFTAAR, TM; BHATTACHARYYA, BB; RICHARDSON, GD+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+SEP 1992::Empirical Likelihood for AR-ARCH Models Based on LAD Estimation+Li, Jin-yu; Liang, Wei; He, Shu-yuan+ACTA MATHEMATICAE APPLICATAE SINICA-ENGLISH SERIES+MAY 2012::no title+Makridakis, S.

Comparison of relative density of two random geometric digraph families in testing spatial clustering,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0344-4,MAR 2014,39,1,"We compare the performance of relative densities of two parameterized random geometric digraph families called proximity catch digraphs (PCDs) in testing bivariate spatial patterns. These PCD families are proportional edge (PE) and central similarity (CS) PCDs and are defined with proximity regions based on relative positions of data points from two classes. The relative densities of these PCDs were previously used as statistics for testing segregation and association patterns against complete spatial randomness. The relative density of a digraph, D, with n vertices (i.e., with order n) represents the ratio of the number of arcs in D to the number of arcs in the complete symmetric digraph of the same order. When scaled properly, the relative density of a PCD is a U-statistic; hence, it has asymptotic normality by the standard central limit theory of U-statistics. The PE- and CS-PCDs are defined with an expansion parameter that determines the size or measure of the associated proximity regions. In this article, we extend the distribution of the relative density of CS-PCDs for expansion parameter being larger than one, and compare finite sample performance of the tests by Monte Carlo simulations and asymptotic performance by Pitman asymptotic efficiency. We find the optimal expansion parameters of the PCDs for testing each alternative in finite samples and in the limit as the sample size tending to infinity. As a result of our comparisons, we demonstrate that in terms of empirical power (i.e., for finite samples) relative density of CS-PCD has better performance (which occurs for expansion parameter values larger than one) for the segregation alternative, while relative density of PE-PCD has better performance for the association alternative. The methods are also illustrated in a real-life data set from plant ecology.","Association,Complete spatial randomness,Delaunay triangulation,Pitman asymptotic efficiency,Proximity catch digraphs,Segregation,U-statistic","NEIGHBOR CONTINGENCY TABLE,COVER CATCH DIGRAPHS,DOMINATION NUMBER,SEGREGATION,GRAPHS,PATTERNS,ASSOCIATION","Ceyhan, Elvan@Koc Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Math, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey","Ceyhan, Elvan@Koc University",not exist,"spatstat: An R package for analyzing spatial point patterns+Baddeley, A; Turner, R+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+JAN 2005::On vertex, edge, and vertex-edge random graphs+Beer, E; Fill, JA; Janson, S<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Scheinerman, ER</span>.+arXiv:0812.1410v2 [math.CO]+2010::Relative density of the random r-factor proximity catch digraph for testing spatial patterns of segregation and association+Ceyhan, E; Priebe, CE; Wierman, JC+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 10 2006::A comparison of two proximity catch digraph families in testing spatial clustering+Ceyhan, E.+Technical Report # KU-EC-10-3+2010::A new family of random graphs for testing spatial segregation+Ceyhan, Elvan; Priebe, Carey E.; Marchette, David J.+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 2007::Spatial Clustering Tests Based on the Domination Number of a New Random Digraph Family+Ceyhan, Elvan+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2011::Extension of one-dimensional proximity regions to higher dimensions+Ceyhan, Elvan+COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+NOV 2010::New Tests of Spatial Segregation Based on Nearest Neighbour Contingency Tables+Ceyhan, Elvan+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2010::ESTIMATION OF SPARSE JACOBIAN MATRICES AND GRAPH-COLORING PROBLEMS+COLEMAN, TF; MORE, JJ+SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS+1983::Identifying aggregation and association in fully mapped spatial data+Coomes, DA; Rees, M; Turnbull, L+ECOLOGY+MAR 1999::no title+Cressie, N.+Statistics for spatial data+1993::Random walks and catch digraphs in classification+DeVinney, J.; Priebe, C.; Marchette, D.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Socolinsky, D</span>.+P 34 S INT COMP SCI+2002::no title+Diggle, PJ.+Statistical analysis of spatial point patterns+2003::TESTING SPATIAL SEGREGATION USING A NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CONTINGENCY TABLE+DIXON, P+ECOLOGY+OCT 1994::Nearest neighbour methods+Dixon, P.M.+Encyclopedia of Environmetrics+2002::Nearest-neighbor contingency table analysis of spatial segregation for several species+Dixon, PM+ECOSCIENCE+2002::On Random Graphs I+Erds, P.; Renyi, A.+Publicationes Mathematicae Debrecen+1959::Spatial graphs: Principles and applications for habitat connectivity+Fall, Andrew; Fortin, Marie-Josee; Manseau, Micheline; et al.+ECOSYSTEMS+APR 2007::A General Tractable Density Concept for Graphs+Farago, Andras+MATHEMATICS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE+JUN 2008::Finding a maximum density subgraph+Goldberg, A.

Identifying common normal distributions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0345-3,MAR 2014,15,2,"Consider a one-way layout where random samples of data are available from k populations, where the distributions of the data from each population are considered to be completely unknown. This paper discusses a methodology for investigating whether it can be concluded that the k unknown distributions, or any subsets of these distributions, can be taken to be equal to a common normal distribution, and if so it is shown how to identify these common normal distributions. This is accomplished with an exact specified error rate by constructing confidence sets for the parameters of the common normal distributions using Kolmogorov's (G. Ist. Ital. Attuari 4:83-91, 1933) procedure. The relationship of this methodology to standard tests of normality and to standard procedures for constructing confidence sets for the parameters of a normal distribution are discussed, together with its relationship to functional data analysis and other standard test procedures for data of this kind. Some examples of the implementation of the methodology are provided.","Normal distribution,Two-sample test,Analysis of variance,Kolmogorov procedure,Functional data analysis","CONFIDENCE SETS,VARIANCE","Hayter, Anthony@Univ Denver, Dept Business Informat & Analyt, Denver, CO 80208 USA","Hayter, Anthony@University of Denver",not exist,"Joint confidence sets for the mean and variance of a normal distribution+Arnold, BC; Shavelle, RM+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::Functional k-sample problem when data are density functions+Delicado, Pedro+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+SEP 2007::no title+Ferraty, F.; Vieu, P.+Nonparametric functional data analysis.

P-splines quantile regression estimation in varying coefficient models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0346-2,MAR 2014,42,9,"Quantile regression, as a generalization of median regression, has been widely used in statistical modeling. To allow for analyzing complex data situations, several flexible regression models have been introduced. Among these are the varying coefficient models, that differ from a classical linear regression model by the fact that the regression coefficients are no longer constant but functions that vary with the value taken by another variable, such as for example, time. In this paper, we study quantile regression in varying coefficient models for longitudinal data. The quantile function is modeled as a function of the covariates and the main task is to estimate the unknown regression coefficient functions. We approximate each coefficient function by means of P-splines. Theoretical properties of the estimators, such as rate of convergence and an asymptotic distribution are established. The estimation methodology requests solving an optimization problem that also involves a smoothing parameter. For a special case the optimization problem can be transformed into a linear programming problem for which then a Frisch-Newton interior point method is used, leading to a computationally fast and efficient procedure. Several data-driven choices of the smoothing parameters are briefly discussed, and their performances are illustrated in a simulation study. Some real data analysis demonstrates the use of the developed method.","B-splines,Longitudinal data,P-splines,Quantile regression,Varying coefficient models","VARIABLE SELECTION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,BOOTSTRAP,PENALTIES,INFERENCE","Andriyana, Y.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Louvain, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr LStat, Louvain, Belgium::Gijbels, I.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Louvain, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr LStat, Louvain, Belgium::Verhasselt, A.@Univ Hasselt, Interuniv Inst Biostat & Stat Bioinformat, CenStat, Hasselt, Belgium","Andriyana, Y.@KU Leuven::Gijbels, I.@KU Leuven::Verhasselt, A.@Hasselt University",not exist,"Penalized likelihood regression for generalized linear models with non-quadratic penalties+Antoniadis, Anestis; Gijbels, Irene; Nikolova, Mila+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+JUN 2011::Variable Selection in Varying-Coefficient Models Using P-Splines+Antoniadis, Anestis; Gijbels, Irene; Verhasselt, Anneleen+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2012::Simultaneous estimation and factor selection in quantile regression via adaptive sup-norm regularization+Bang, Sungwan; Jhun, Myoungshic+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 1 2012::no title+Bernstein, D.

Estimating the upcrossings index,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0315-9,NOV 2013,32,0,"For stationary sequences, under general dependence restrictions, any limiting point process for time normalized upcrossings of high levels is a compound Poisson process, i.e., there is a clustering of high upcrossings, where the underlying Poisson points represent cluster positions and the multiplicities correspond to cluster sizes. For such classes of stationary sequences, there exists the upcrossings index eta, 0a parts per thousand currency sign eta a parts per thousand currency sign1, which is directly related to the extremal index theta, 0a parts per thousand currency sign theta a parts per thousand currency sign1, for suitable high levels. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the upcrossings index eta for a class of stationary sequences satisfying a mild oscillation restriction. For the proposed estimator, properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality are studied. Finally, the performance of the estimator is assessed through simulation studies for autoregressive processes and case studies in the fields of environment and finance. Comparisons with other estimators derived from well known estimators of the extremal index are also presented.","Upcrossings index,Local dependence conditions,Consistency and asymptotic normality","EXTREMAL INDEX,STATIONARY SEQUENCE,VALUES,JACKKNIFE,INFERENCE,BOOTSTRAP,BLOCKS","Sebastiao, J.

U-tests for variance components in linear mixed models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0316-8,NOV 2013,33,5,We propose a U-statistics-based test for null variance components in linear mixed models and obtain its asymptotic distribution (for increasing number of units) under mild regularity conditions that include only the existence of the second moment for the random effects and of the fourth moment for the conditional errors. We employ contiguity arguments to derive the distribution of the test under local alternatives assuming additionally the existence of the fourth moment of the random effects. Our proposal is easy to implement and may be applied to a wide class of linear mixed models. We also consider a simulation study to evaluate the behaviour of the U-test in small and moderate samples and compare its performance with that of exact F-tests and of generalized likelihood ratio tests obtained under the assumption of normality.

Eliciting Dirichlet and Connor-Mosimann prior distributions for multinomial models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0336-4,NOV 2013,22,8,"This paper addresses the task of eliciting an informative prior distribution for multinomial models. We first introduce a method of eliciting univariate beta distributions for the probability of each category, conditional on the probabilities of other categories. Two different forms of multivariate prior are derived from the elicited beta distributions. First, we determine the hyperparameters of a Dirichlet distribution by reconciling the assessed parameters of the univariate beta conditional distributions. Although the Dirichlet distribution is the standard conjugate prior distribution for multinomial models, it is not flexible enough to represent a broad range of prior information. Second, we use the beta distributions to determine the parameters of a Connor-Mosimann distribution, which is a generalization of a Dirichlet distribution and is also a conjugate prior for multinomial models. It has a larger number of parameters than the standard Dirichlet distribution and hence a more flexible structure. The elicitation methods are designed to be used with the aid of interactive graphical user-friendly software.","Elicitation method,Prior distribution,Dirichlet distribution,Connor-Mosimann distribution,Multinomial model,Interactive graphical software","CONTINGENCY-TABLES,ELICITATION","Elfadaly, Fadlalla G.@Open Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England@Cairo Univ, Dept Stat, Cairo, Egypt::Garthwaite, Paul H.@Open Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England","Elfadaly, Fadlalla G.@Cairo University@Open University - UK::Garthwaite, Paul H.@Open University - UK","Garthwaite, Paul@A-3664-2009","no title+Aitchison, J.+The statistical analysis of compositional data+1986::MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTIONS AND ESTIMATION IN CONTINGENCY-TABLES+ALBERT, JH; GUPTA, AK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::ESTIMATION OF A DIRICHLET PRIOR DISTRIBUTION+BUNN, DW+OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+1978::SOME PROPERTIES OF THE DIRICHLET-MULTINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION AND ITS USE IN PRIOR ELICITATION+CHALONER, K; DUNCAN, GT+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1987::CONCEPTS OF INDEPENDENCE FOR PROPORTIONS WITH A GENERALIZATION OF DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION+CONNOR, RJ; MOSIMANN, JE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::Bayesian methods for multinomial sampling with noninforma-tively missing data+Dickey, JM; Jiang, JM; Kadane, JB.+Technical report 6/83 - #15+1983::THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRODUCT OF INDEPENDENT BETA VARIABLES+FAN, DY+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1991::no title+Forster, J.; OHagan, A.+Kendalls Advanced Theory of Statistics+2004::Statistical methods for eliciting probability distributions+Garthwaite, PH; Kadane, JB; O'Hagan, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2005::A Generalization of the Dirichlet Distribution+Hankin, Robin K.

A direct approach to risk approximation for vast portfolios under gross-exposure constraint using high-frequency data,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0337-3,NOV 2013,17,1,"It is well known that the traditional estimated risk for the Markowitz mean-variance optimization had been demonstrated to seriously depart from its theoretic optimal risk due to accumulation of input estimation errors. Fan et al. (in J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 107:592-606, 2012a) addressed the problem by introducing the gross-exposure constrained mean-variance portfolio selection. In this paper, we present a direct approach to estimate the risk for vast portfolios using asynchronous and noisy high-frequency data. This approach alleviates accumulation of the estimation error of tens of hundreds of integrated volatilities (or co-volatilities), and on the other hand it has the advantage of smoothing away the microstructure noise in the spatial direction. Based on the simple approach, together with the ""pre-averaging"" technique, we obtain a sharper bound of the risk approximation error than that in Fan et al. (in J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 107:412-428, 2012b). This bound is locally dependent on the allocation plan satisfying the gross-exposure constraint. The bound does not require exponential tail of the distribution of the microstructure noise. Finite fourth moment suffices. Our work also demonstrates that the mean squared error of the risk estimator can be decreased by choosing an optimal tuning parameter depending on the allocation plan. This is more pronounced for the moderately high-frequency data. Our theoretical results are further confirmed by simulations.","Ito process,Vast portfolio,Gross-exposure constraint","VOLATILITY MATRIX ESTIMATION,MICROSTRUCTURE NOISE,FINANCIAL DATA,SELECTION","Kong, Xin-Bing@Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Dept Stat, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China","Kong, Xin-Bing@Fudan University",not exist,"Multivariate realised kernels: Consistent positive semi-definite estimators of the covariation of equity prices with noise and non-synchronous trading+Barndorff-Nielsen, O.

Two-stage benchmarking as applied to small area estimation,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0338-2,NOV 2013,8,8,"There has been recent growth in small area estimation due to the need for more precise estimation of small geographic areas, which has led to groups such as the U.S. Census Bureau, Google, and the RAND corporation utilizing small area-estimation procedures. We develop a novel two-stage benchmarking methodology using a single weighted squared error loss function that combines the loss at the unit level and the area level without any specific distributional assumptions. This loss is considered while benchmarking the weighted means at each level or both the weighted means and weighted variability at the unit level. Furthermore, we provide multivariate extensions for benchmarking weighted means at both levels. The behavior of our methods is analyzed using a complex study from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 2000, which estimates the proportion of people that do not have health insurance for many domains of an Asian subpopulation. Finally, the methodology is explored via simulated data under the proposed model. Ultimately, three proposed benchmarked Bayes estimators do not dominate each other, leaving much exploration for further understanding of such complex studies such as the choice of weights, optimal algorithms for efficiency, as well as extensions to multi-stage benchmarking methods.","Small area estimation,Benchmarking,Decision theory,Bayesian methodology,MCMC,Complex survey,Weighting",,"Ghosh, Malay@Univ Florida, Dept Stat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Steorts, Rebecca C.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Ghosh, Malay@State University System of Florida@University of Florida::Steorts, Rebecca C.@Carnegie Mellon University",not exist,"AN ERROR-COMPONENTS MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF COUNTY CROP AREAS USING SURVEY AND SATELLITE DATA+BATTESE, GE; HARTER, RM; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1988::Benchmarking small area estimators+Bell, W.

We found that the imaginary part of the dielectric relaxation spectra of free and clamped PVDF samples is dominated by a peak, above 100 kHz, that can be characterized by a Havriliak-Negami function. The characteristic time follows an Arrhenius dependence on temperature. Moreover, the spectra of the free PVDF samples show two additional peaks at low frequencies which are associated with mechanical relaxation processes. Our results are important for the characterization of piezoelectric PVDF, particularly after the stretching and poling processes in thin films, and for the design and characterization of a broad range of ultrasonic transducers.

An updated review of Goodness-of-Fit tests for regression models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0327-5,SEP 2013,311,39,"This survey intends to collect the developments on Goodness-of-Fit for regression models during the last 20 years, from the very first origins with the proposals based on the idea of the tests for density and distribution, until the most recent advances for complex data and models. Far from being exhaustive, the contents in this paper are focused on two main classes of tests statistics: smoothing-based tests (kernel-based) and tests based on empirical regression processes, although other tests based on Maximum Likelihood ideas will be also considered. Starting from the simplest case of testing a parametric family for the regression curves, the contributions in this field provide also testing procedures in semiparametric, nonparametric, and functional models, dealing also with more complex settings, as those ones involving dependent or incomplete data.","Bootstrap calibration,Empirical distribution of the residuals,Empirical regression process,Likelihood ratio tests,Smoothing tests","BICKEL-ROSENBLATT TEST,NONLINEAR TIME-SERIES,BERKSON MEASUREMENT ERRORS,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,SINGLE-INDEX MODELS,NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES,MARTINGALE DIFFERENCE HYPOTHESIS,BOOTSTRAP SPECIFICATION TESTS,KERNEL DENSITY ESTIMATOR,LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS","Gonzalez-Manteiga, Wenceslao@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Math, Dpt Stat & Operat Res, Santiago De Compostela, Spain::Crujeiras, Rosa M.@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Math, Dpt Stat & Operat Res, Santiago De Compostela, Spain","Gonzalez-Manteiga, Wenceslao@University of Santiago De Compostela::Crujeiras, Rosa M.@University of Santiago De Compostela","Crujeiras, Rosa@I-7461-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3907-8951::Gonzalez Manteiga, Wenceslao@E-4253-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3555-4623","Testing continuous-time models of the spot interest rate+Ait-Sahalia, Y+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+SUM 1996::NONPARAMETRIC TESTS OF THE MARKOV HYPOTHESIS IN CONTINUOUS-TIME MODELS+Ait-Sahalia, Yacine; Fan, Jianqing; Jiang, Jiancheng+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2010::Non-parametric estimation of the residual distribution+Akritas, MG; Van Keilegom, I+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2001::Goodness of fit testing using a specific density estimate+Albers, Casper J.; Schaafsma, Willem+STATISTICS &amp; RISK MODELING+MAR 2008::Goodness of fit test for linear models based on local polynomials.+Alcala, T; Cristobal, JA; Gonzalez-Manteiga, W.+Stat Probab Lett+1999::Estimation and testing in a partial linear regression model under long-memory dependence+Aneiros-Perez, G; Gonzalez-Manteiga, W; Vieu, P+BERNOULLI+FEB 2004::Empirical comparisons in short-term interest rate models using nonparametric methods+Arapis, M.; Gao, J.+J.

Comments on: An updated review of Goodness-of-Fit tests for regression models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0330-x,SEP 2013,36,2,"We discuss the following two particular aspects of the paper of Gonzalez-Manteiga and Crujeiras (10.1007/s11749-013-0327-5): First, what changes if the null hypothesis is non-or semiparametric? For example, Rodriguez-Poo et al. (A practical test for misspecification in regression: functional form, separability, and distribution. Econom. Theory, 2013, under revision) considered optimal rates of adaptive nonparametric tests when the null model is semiparametric. A second, though related question is, how serious are the bandwidth and calibration problems? Sperlich (On the choice of regularization parameters in specification testing: a critical discussion. Empir. Econ., 2013, forthcoming) has shown that the unsolved bandwidth selection problems, in particular when calibrating, render nonparametric specification tests useless in practice. Two additional questions are only raised briefly and concern (a) the computational aspects, and (b) the problem that asymptotically, nonparametric omnibus tests might reject almost any null hypothesis as probably no parametric or semiparametric model is 100 % correct. But it is maybe a reasonable and useful approximation. To this aim we recall the idea of testing the problem of so-called 'precise hypotheses' as outlined in Dette (Ann.

Reducing the mean squared error of quantile-based estimators by smoothing,TEST,10.1007/s11749-012-0293-3,SEP 2013,16,2,"Many univariate robust estimators are based on quantiles. As already theoretically pointed out by Fernholz (in J. Stat. Plan. Inference 57(1), 29-38, 1997), smoothing the empirical distribution function with an appropriate kernel and bandwidth can reduce the variance and mean squared error (MSE) of some quantile-based estimators in small data sets. In this paper we apply this idea on several robust estimators of location, scale and skewness. We propose a robust bandwidth selection and bias reduction procedure. We show that the use of this smoothing method indeed leads to smaller MSEs, also at contaminated data sets. In particular, we obtain better performances for the medcouple which is a robust measure of skewness that can be used for outlier detection in skewed distributions.","Kernel smoothing,Robust bandwidth selection,Quantile based estimators,Medcouple,Adjusted boxplot",BANDWIDTH,"Hubert, Mia@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math LStat, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium::Gijbels, Irene@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math LStat, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium::Vanpaemel, Dina@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math LStat, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium","Hubert, Mia@KU Leuven::Gijbels, Irene@KU Leuven::Vanpaemel, Dina@KU Leuven","Hubert, Mia@B-7434-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6398-4850","A NOTE ON THE ESTIMATION OF A DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION AND QUANTILES BY A KERNEL-METHOD+AZZALINI, A+BIOMETRIKA+1981::Bandwidth selection for the smoothing of distribution functions+Bowman, A; Hall, P; Prvan, T+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1998::A robust measure of skewness+Brys, G; Hubert, M; Struyf, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2004::A comparison of some new measures of skewness+Brys, G; Hubert, M; Struyf, A.+DEV ROBUST STAT+2003::Smoothed L-estimation of regression function+Cizek, P.; Tamine, J.; Haerdle, W.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 15 2008::Estimation of integrated squared density derivatives from a contaminated sample+Delaigle, A; Gijbels, I+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2002::Reducing the variance by smoothing+Fernholz, LT+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JAN 15 1997::An adjusted boxplot for skewed distributions+Hubert, M.; Vandervieren, E.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 15 2008::Robust classification for skewed data+Hubert, Mia; Van der Veeken, Stephan+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+DEC 2010::Outlier detection for skewed data+Hubert, Mia; Van der Veeken, Stephan+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+MAR-APR 2008::Some New Estimates for Distribution Functions+Nadaraya, E.

On the breakdown behavior of the TCLUST clustering procedure,TEST,10.1007/s11749-012-0312-4,SEP 2013,17,3,"Clustering procedures allowing for general covariance structures of the obtained clusters need some constraints on the solutions. With this in mind, several proposals have been introduced in the literature. The TCLUST procedure works with a restriction on the ""eigenvalues-ratio"" of the clusters scatter matrices. In order to try to achieve robustness with respect to outliers, the procedure allows to trim off a proportion alpha of the most outlying observations. The resistance to infinitesimal contamination of the TCLUST has already been studied. This paper aims to look at its resistance to a higher amount of contamination by means of the study of its breakdown behavior. The rather new concept of restricted breakdown point will demonstrate that the TCLUST procedure resists to a proportion alpha of contamination as soon as the data set is sufficiently ""well clustered"".","Breakdown point,Clustering,Robustness,TCLUST,Trimming","TRIMMED K-MEANS,ROBUST","Ruwet, C.@Univ Liege, Dept Math, B-4000 Liege, Belgium::Garcia-Escudero, L.

On the effect of noisy measurements of the regressor in functional linear models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0325-7,SEP 2013,23,0,"We consider the estimation of the slope function in functional linear regression, where a scalar response Y is modelled in dependence of a random function X, when Y and only a panel Z (1),aEuro broken vertical bar,Z (L) of noisy measurements of X are observable. Assuming an i.i.d. sample of (Y,Z (1),aEuro broken vertical bar,Z (L) ) of size n we propose an estimator of the slope which is based on a dimension reduction technique and additional thresholding. We derive in terms of both the sample size n and the panel size L a lower bound of a maximal weighted risk over a certain ellipsoid of slope functions and a certain class of covariance operators associated with the regressor X. It is shown that the proposed estimator attains this lower bound up to a constant and hence it is minimax-optimal. The results are illustrated considering different configurations which cover in particular the estimation of the slope as well as its derivatives.","Minimax-optimal estimation,Linear Galerkin approach,Linear inverse problem,Sobolev space",ESTIMATORS,"Bereswill, Mareike@Unknow::Johannes, Jan@Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles ISBA, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium","Bereswill, Mareike@Unknow::Johannes, Jan@Universite Catholique Louvain",not exist,"no title+Bereswill, M.+Minimax-optimal estimation in functional linear model with noisy regressor+2009::no title+Bosq, D.+Linear processes in function spaces.

Reweighted least trimmed squares: an alternative to one-step estimators,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0335-5,SEP 2013,34,3,"A new class of robust regression estimators is proposed that forms an alternative to traditional robust one-step estimators and that achieves the rate of convergence irrespective of the initial estimator under a wide range of distributional assumptions. The proposed reweighted least trimmed squares (RLTS) estimator employs data-dependent weights determined from an initial robust fit. Just like many existing one- and two-step robust methods, the RLTS estimator preserves robust properties of the initial robust estimate. However contrary to existing methods, the first-order asymptotic behavior of RLTS is independent of the initial estimate even if errors exhibit heteroscedasticity, asymmetry, or serial correlation. Moreover, we derive the asymptotic distribution of RLTS and show that it is asymptotically efficient for normally distributed errors. A simulation study documents benefits of these theoretical properties in finite samples.","Asymptotic efficiency,Breakdown point,Least trimmed squares,Linear regression","LINEAR-REGRESSION,ROBUST,BREAKDOWN,MODELS","Cizek, Pavel@Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & OR, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","Cizek, Pavel@Tilburg University",not exist,"Two-step robust estimation of fixed-effects panel data models+Aquaro, M; Cizek, P.+CentER discussion paper+2010::LARGE SHOCKS, SMALL SHOCKS, AND ECONOMIC-FLUCTUATIONS - OUTLIERS IN MACROECONOMIC TIME-SERIES+BALKE, NS; FOMBY, TB+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+APR-JUN 1994::Testing for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in a random effects panel data model+Baltagi, Badi H.; Jung, Byoung Cheol; Song, Seuck Heun+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 2010::no title+CHEN LA+J NONPARAMETR STAT+1996::Reweighted least trimmed squares: an alternative to one-step estimators+Cizek, P.+CentER discussion paper 2010/91+2010::Semiparametrically weighted robust estimation of regression models+Cizek, Pavel+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 1 2011::GENERAL TRIMMED ESTIMATION: ROBUST APPROACH TO NONLINEAR AND LIMITED DEPENDENT VARIABLE MODELS+Cizek, Pavel+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+DEC 2008::Least trimmed squares in nonlinear regression under dependence+Cizek, Pavel+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 1 2006::no title+Davidson, J.+Stochastic Limit Theory: An Introduction for Econometricians+1994::Breakdown and groups+Davies, PL; Gather, U+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2005::EQUIPMENT INVESTMENT AND ECONOMIC-GROWTH+DELONG, JB; SUMMERS, LH+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1991::The empirical process of autoregressive residuals+Engler, Eric; Nielsen, Bent+ECONOMETRICS JOURNAL+2009::Comprehensive definitions of breakdown points for independent and dependent observations+Genton, MG; Lucas, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::A class of robust and fully efficient regression estimators+Gervini, D; Yohai, VJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2002::no title+Hampel, F.

Penalized likelihood ratio tests for repeated measurement models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0324-8,SEP 2013,31,0,"In this paper, we propose a novel test procedure for repeated measurements based on the penalized likelihood ratio (PLR). The procedure provides an alternative to the standard likelihood ratio tests for evaluating null hypotheses concerning the correlation structure of repeated measurements. PLR tests are specifically designed for nonstandard test situations where non-identifiability of a nuisance parameter occurs under the null hypothesis. The idea is to penalize the estimation close to the boundary of the domain of the nuisance parameter and thereby eliminate the non-identifiability. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the PLR test is a 50:50 mixture of chi-square distributions with 0 and 1 degrees of freedom. Simulation studies indicate that the asymptotic distribution of the PLR test provides a good approximation, even for fairly small data sets (10-20 subjects). A sensitivity analysis with a real data example highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the test procedure.","Autoregressive covariance structure,Locally most powerful test,Mixtures of chi(2) distributions,Nonstandard regularity conditions","FINITE MIXTURE-MODELS,VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,HOMOGENEITY","Ritz, Christian@Univ Copenhagen, Fac Life Sci, Frederiksberg C, Denmark","Ritz, Christian@University of Copenhagen",not exist,"Testing for a finite mixture model with two components+Chen, HF; Chen, JH; Kalbfleisch, JD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::A modified likelihood ratio test for homogeneity in finite mixture models+Chen, HF; Chen, JH; Kalbfleisch, JD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::Penalized likelihood-ratio test for finite mixture models with multinomial observations+Chen, JH+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+DEC 1998::On the asymptotic behaviour of the pseudolikelihood ratio test statistic with boundary problems+Chen, Yong; Liang, Kung-Yee+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2010::Likelihood ratio tests in linear mixed models with one variance component+Crainiceanu, CM; Ruppert, D+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::Likelihood Ratio Testing for Admixture Models with Application to Genetic Linkage Analysis+Di, Chong-Zhi; Liang, Kung-Yee+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2011::AN APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF REPEATED MEASUREMENTS+DIGGLE, PJ+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1988::no title+Fitzmaurice, GM; Laird, NM; Ware, JH.+Applied longitudinal analysis+2011::Anisotropic Matern correlation and spatial prediction using REML+Haskard, KA; Cullis, BR; Verbyla, AP.+J Agric Biol Environ Stat+2007::UNBALANCED REPEATED-MEASURES MODELS WITH STRUCTURED COVARIANCE MATRICES+JENNRICH, RI; SCHLUCHTER, MD+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1986::Kriging a Soil Variable With a Simple Nonstationary Variance Model+Lark, R.

Model-free model-fitting and predictive distributions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-013-0317-7,JUN 2013,65,12,"The problem of prediction is revisited with a view towards going beyond the typical nonparametric setting and reaching a fully model-free environment for predictive inference, i.e., point predictors and predictive intervals. A basic principle of model-free prediction is laid out based on the notion of transforming a given setup into one that is easier to work with, namely i.i.d. or Gaussian. As an application, the problem of nonparametric regression is addressed in detail; the model-free predictors are worked out, and shown to be applicable under minimal assumptions. Interestingly, model-free prediction in regression is a totally automatic technique that does not necessitate the search for an optimal data transformation before model fitting. The resulting model-free predictive distributions and intervals are compared to their corresponding model-based analogs, and the use of cross-validation is extensively discussed. As an aside, improved prediction intervals in linear regression are also obtained.","Bootstrap,Cross-validation,Frequentist prediction,Heteroskedasticity,Nonparametric estimation,Prediction intervals,Regression,Smoothing,Transformations","BOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,CROSS-VALIDATION,CURVE ESTIMATION,KERNEL,TRANSFORMATIONS,ESTIMATORS,BANDS,STATISTICS,WORLD","Politis, Dimitris N.@Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Math, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Politis, Dimitris N.@University of California San Diego@University of California System",not exist,"AN INTRODUCTION TO KERNEL AND NEAREST-NEIGHBOR NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION+ALTMAN, NS+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::no title+Atkinson, A.

Penalized spline approaches for functional logit regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-012-0307-1,JUN 2013,38,9,"The problem of multicollinearity associated with the estimation of a functional logit model can be solved by using as predictor variables a set of functional principal components. The functional parameter estimated by functional principal component logit regression is often nonsmooth and then difficult to interpret. To solve this problem, different penalized spline estimations of the functional logit model are proposed in this paper. All of them are based on smoothed functional PCA and/or a discrete penalty in the log-likelihood criterion in terms of B-spline expansions of the sample curves and the functional parameter. The ability of these smoothing approaches to provide an accurate estimation of the functional parameter and their classification performance with respect to unpenalized functional PCA and LDA-PLS are evaluated via simulation and application to real data. Leave-one-out cross-validation and generalized cross-validation are adapted to select the smoothing parameter and the number of principal components or basis functions associated with the considered approaches.","Functional logit regression,Functional principal components analysis,Penalized splines,B-splines","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,STOCHASTIC-PROCESS,B-SPLINES,ESTIMATORS,CLASSIFICATION,CURVES,PCA","Carmen Aguilera-Morillo, M.@Fac Farm, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Granada 18071, Spain::Aguilera, Ana M.@Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, E-18071 Granada, Spain::Escabias, Manuel@Fac Farm, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Granada 18071, Spain::Valderrama, Mariano J.@Fac Farm, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Granada 18071, Spain","Carmen Aguilera-Morillo, M.@Unknow::Aguilera, Ana M.@University of Granada::Escabias, Manuel@Unknow::Valderrama, Mariano J.@Unknow","Aguilera, Ana@H-5140-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2425-6716::Escabias, Manuel@L-2510-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1653-9022","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical data analysis+1990::Computational approaches to estimation in the principal component analysis of a stochastic process+Aguilera, AM; Gutierrez, R; Ocana, FA; et al.+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS AND DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 1995::Approximation of estimators in the PCA of a stochastic process using B-splines+Aguilera, AM; Gutierrez, R; Valderrama, MJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1996::Using basis expansions for estimating functional PLS regression Applications with chemometric data+Aguilera, Ana M.; Escabias, Manuel; Preda, Cristian; et al.+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+DEC 15 2010::Discussion of different logistic models with functional data.

Functional projection pursuit regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-012-0306-2,JUN 2013,36,40,"In this paper we introduce a flexible approach to approximate the regression function in the case of a functional predictor and a scalar response. Following the Projection Pursuit Regression principle, we derive an additive decomposition which exploits the most interesting projections of the prediction variable to explain the response. On one hand, this approach allows us to avoid the well-known curse of dimensionality problem, and, on the other one, it can be used as an exploratory tool for the analysis of functional dataset. The terms of such decomposition are estimated with a procedure that combines a spline approximation and the one-dimensional Nadaraya-Watson approach. The good behavior of our procedure is illustrated from theoretical and practical points of view. Asymptotic results state that the terms in the additive decomposition can be estimated without suffering from the dimensionality problem, while some applications to real and simulated data show the high predictive performance of our method.","Additive decomposition,Consistency,Functional predictor,Functional regression,Predictive directions,Projection pursuit regression","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,INDEX MODEL,PREDICTORS,ESTIMATORS","Ferraty, F.@Univ Toulouse 3, ESP, Inst Math Toulouse, F-31062 Toulouse, France::Goia, A.@Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dipartimento Econ & Impresa, I-28100 Novara, Italy::Salinelli, E.@Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dipartimento Econ & Impresa, I-28100 Novara, Italy::Vieu, P.@Univ Toulouse 3, ESP, Inst Math Toulouse, F-31062 Toulouse, France","Ferraty, F.@Universite de Toulouse@Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier@Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE)::Goia, A.@University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro::Salinelli, E.@University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro::Vieu, P.@Universite de Toulouse@Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier@Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE)",not exist,"Cross-validated estimations in the single-functional index model+Ait-Saidi, Ahmed; Ferraty, Frederic; Kassa, Rabah; et al.+STATISTICS+2008::Dimension reduction in functional regression with applications+Amato, U; Antoniadis, A; De Feis, I+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 1 2006::Semi-functional partial linear regression+Aneiros-Perez, German; Vieu, Philippe+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 1 2006::no title+Burnham, K.

It is assumed that there is some dependent censoring acting on the variable of interest that may come from an existing competing risk. Furthermore, the full process is independently censored by some administrative censoring time. The dependent censoring is modeled through an Archimedean copula function, which is supposed to be known. An asymptotic representation of the estimator as a sum of independent and identically distributed random variables is obtained, and, consequently, a central limit theorem is established.

A goodness-of-fit testing approach for normality based on the posterior predictive distribution,TEST,10.1007/s11749-012-0282-6,MAR 2013,22,3,"In this paper, we propose several new goodness-of-fit tests for normality based on the distance between the observed sample and the predictive sample drawn from the posterior predictive distribution. Note that the predictive sample is stochastic for a set of given sample observations, the distance being consequently random. To circumvent the randomness, we choose the conditional expectation and qth quantile as the test statistics. Two statistics are related to the well-known Shapiro-Francia test, and their asymptotic distributions are derived. The simulation study shows that the new tests are able to better discriminate between the normal distribution and heavy-tailed distributions or mixed normal distributions. Against those alternatives, the new tests are more powerful than existing tests including the Anderson-Darling test and the Shapiro-Wilk test, which are two of the best tests of normality in the literature.","Goodness-of-fit test,Posterior predictive distribution,Predictive ample,Anderson-Darling test,Shapiro-Wilk test","VARIANCE TEST,STATISTICS","He, Daojiang@Beijing Inst Technol, Dept Math, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China@Anhui Normal Univ, Dept Math, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China::Xu, Xingzhong@Beijing Inst Technol, Dept Math, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","He, Daojiang@Beijing Institute of Technology@Anhui Normal University::Xu, Xingzhong@Beijing Institute of Technology",not exist,"A TEST OF GOODNESS OF FIT+ANDERSON, TW; DARLING, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1954::no title+D'Agostino, R.

Recovering the shape of a point cloud in the plane,TEST,10.1007/s11749-012-0283-5,MAR 2013,22,5,"In this work we deal with the problem of estimating the support S of a probability distribution under shape restrictions. The shape restriction we deal with is an extension of the notion of convexity named alpha-convexity. Instead of assuming, as in the convex case, the existence of a separating hyperplane for each exterior point of S, we assume the existence of a separating open ball with radius alpha. Given an alpha-convex set S, the alpha-convex hull of independent random points in S is the natural estimator of the set. If alpha is unknown the r (n) -convex hull of the sample can be considered being r (n) a sequence of positive numbers. We analyze the asymptotic properties of the r (n) -convex hull estimator in the bidimensional case and obtain the convergence rate for the expected distance in measure between the set and the estimator. The geometrical complexity of the estimator and its dependence on r (n) are also obtained via the analysis of the expected number of vertices of the r (n) -convex hull.","Convex set,alpha-convex set,Set estimation,Distance in measure,Image analysis","CONVEX-SETS,BOUNDARIES","Pateiro-Lopez, Beatriz@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Matemat, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain::Rodriguez-Casal, Alberto@Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Matemat, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain","Pateiro-Lopez, Beatriz@University of Santiago De Compostela::Rodriguez-Casal, Alberto@University of Santiago De Compostela","Pateiro-Lopez, Beatriz@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7714-1835::Rodriguez-Casal, Alberto@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9603-5931","On the estimation of a star-shaped set+Baillo, A; Cuevas, A.+Advances in Applied Probability+2001::ORDERING OF MULTIVARIATE DATA+BARNETT, V+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1976::no title+Benson, R.

Semiparametric additive models under symmetric distributions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-012-0309-z,MAR 2013,28,10,"In this paper we discuss estimation and diagnostic procedures in semiparametric additive models with symmetric errors in order to permit distributions with heavier and lighter tails than the normal ones, such as Student-t, Pearson VII, power exponential, logistics I and II, and contaminated normal, among others. Such models belong to the general class of statistical models GAMLSS proposed by Rigby and Stasinopoulos (Appl. Stat. 54:507-554, 2005). A back-fitting algorithm to attain the maximum penalized likelihood estimates (MPLEs) by using natural cubic smoothing splines is presented. In particular, the score functions and Fisher information matrices for the parameters of interest are expressed in a similar notation of that used in parametric symmetric models.

Wavelet penalized likelihood estimation in generalized functional models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-012-0310-6,MAR 2013,45,0,"The paper deals with generalized functional regression. The aim is to estimate the influence of covariates on observations, drawn from an exponential distribution. The link considered has a semiparametric expression: if we are interested in a functional influence of some covariates, we authorize others to be modeled linearly. We thus consider a generalized partially linear regression model with unknown regression coefficients and an unknown nonparametric function. We present a maximum penalized likelihood procedure to estimate the components of the model introducing penalty based wavelet estimators. Asymptotic rates of the estimates of both the parametric and the nonparametric part of the model are given and quasi-minimax optimality is obtained under usual conditions in literature. We establish in particular that the a"""" (1)-penalty leads to an adaptive estimation with respect to the regularity of the estimated function. An algorithm based on backfitting and Fisher-scoring is also proposed for implementation. Simulations are used to illustrate the finite sample behavior, including a comparison with kernel- and spline-based methods.","Generalized partially linear regression,Semiparametric models,M-estimation,Penalized loglikelihood estimation,Wavelet thresholding","PARTIALLY LINEAR-MODELS,SMOOTHING NOISY DATA,FMRI TIME-SERIES,CROSS-VALIDATION,REGRESSION,SHRINKAGE,PENALTIES,SELECTION","Gannaz, Irene@Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, Inst Camille Jordan, CNRS UMR 5208, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France","Gannaz, Irene@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite Jean Monnet@Ecole Centrale de Lyon@Universite de Lyon (ComUE)@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1",not exist,"Wavelets: A package of funtions for computing wavelet filters, wavelet transforms and multiresolution analyses+ALDRICH, E.+R package version 0.2-6+2010::Regularization of wavelet approximations+Antoniadis, A; Fan, JQ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::Wavelet shrinkage for natural exponential families with cubic variance functions+Antoniadis, A; Besbeas, P; Sapatinas, T.+Sankhya Indian J Stat+2001::Smoothing noisy data with tapered coiflets series+Antoniadis, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 1996::Penalized likelihood regression for generalized linear models with non-quadratic penalties+Antoniadis, Anestis; Gijbels, Irene; Nikolova, Mila+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+JUN 2011::M-ESTIMATION OF MULTIVARIATE LINEAR-REGRESSION PARAMETERS UNDER A CONVEX DISCREPANCY FUNCTION+BAI, ZD; RAO, CR; WU, Y+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1992::An adaptive compression algorithm in Besov spaces+Birge, L; Massart, P+CONSTRUCTIVE APPROXIMATION+2000::Robust estimates in generalized partially linear models+Boente, Graciela; He, Xuming; Zhou, Jianhui+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2006::NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION IN EXPONENTIAL FAMILIES+Brown, Lawrence D.; Cai, T.

Optimal designs for some stochastic processes whose covariance is a function of the mean,TEST,10.1007/s11749-012-0311-5,MAR 2013,33,4,"This paper considers optimal experimental designs for models with correlated observations through a covariance function depending on the magnitude of the responses. This suggests the use of stochastic processes whose covariance structure is a function of the mean. Covariance functions must be positive definite. This fact is nontrivial in this context and constitutes one of the challenges of the present paper. We show that there exists a huge class of functions that, composed with the mean of the process in some way, preserves positive definiteness and can be used for the purposes of modeling and computing optimal designs in more realistic situations. We offer some examples for an easy construction of such covariances and then study the problem of locally D-optimal designs through an illustrative example as well as a real radiation retention model in the human body.","Compartmental Models,Covariance depending on the mean,Information matrix,Locally D-optimal design,Radiation retention model","SPATIAL SAMPLING DESIGN,CORRELATED OBSERVATIONS,RADIATION RETENTION,MODELS,VARIANCE,ISSUES,POWER","Amo-Salas, Mariano@Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Med, Dept Math, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain::Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@Univ Castilla La Mancha, ETSI Ind, Dept Math, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain::Porcu, Emilio@Univ Valparaiso, Dept Estadist, Valparaiso 2360102, Chile","Amo-Salas, Mariano@Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha::Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha::Porcu, Emilio@Universidad de Valparaiso","Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@A-2412-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7502-8188::Amo-Salas, Mariano@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0956-2531","Optimal Designs for Two Nested Pharmacokinetic Models with Correlated Observations+Amo-Salas, M.; Lopez-Fidalgo, J.; Lopez-Rios, V.

The proposed procedure, unlike standard procedures which are also referred to, utilizes the empirical characteristic function of properly estimated residuals. The limit behavior of the test statistic is investigated under the null hypothesis as well as under alternatives. Since the asymptotic null distribution contains unknown parameters, a bootstrap procedure is proposed in order to actually perform the test and corresponding results on the finite-sample performance of the new method are presented.

An informative subset-based estimator for censored quantile regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0266-y,DEC 2012,24,11,"Quantile regression in the presence of fixed censoring has been studied extensively in the literature. However, existing methods either suffer from computational instability or require complex procedures involving trimming and smoothing, which complicates the asymptotic theory of the resulting estimators. In this paper, we propose a simple estimator that is obtained by applying standard quantile regression to observations in an informative subset. The proposed method is computationally convenient and conceptually transparent. We demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves the same asymptotical efficiency as the Powell's estimator, as long as the conditional censoring probability can be estimated consistently at a nonparametric rate and the estimated function satisfies some smoothness conditions. A simulation study suggests that the proposed estimator has stable and competitive performance relative to more elaborate competitors.","Asymptotic efficiency,Censoring probability,Fixed censoring,Informative subset,Nonparametric,Quantile regression","NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,MODELS","Tang, Yanlin@Fudan Univ, Dept Stat, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China::Wang, Huixia Judy@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::He, Xuming@Univ Illinois, Dept Stat, Champaign, IL 61820 USA::Zhu, Zhongyi@Fudan Univ, Dept Stat, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China","Tang, Yanlin@Fudan University::Wang, Huixia Judy@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina::He, Xuming@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Illinois System::Zhu, Zhongyi@Fudan University",not exist,"AN INTRODUCTION TO KERNEL AND NEAREST-NEIGHBOR NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION+ALTMAN, NS+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::An alternative estimator for the censored quantile regression model+Buchinsky, M; Hahn, JY+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1998::CHANGES IN THE UNITED-STATES WAGE STRUCTURE 1963-1987 - APPLICATION OF QUANTILE REGRESSION+BUCHINSKY, M+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1994::Estimation of semiparametric models when the criterion function is not smooth+Chen, XH; Linton, O; Van Keilegom, I+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2003::Three-step censored quantile regression and extramarital affairs+Chernozhukov, V; Hong, H+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2002::Computational aspects of censored quantile regression+Fitzenberger, B+L(1)-STATISTICAL PROCEDURES AND RELATED TOPICS+1997::A guide to censored quantile regressions+Fitzenberger, B.+HANDB STAT+1997::Improving the computation of censored quantile regressions+Fitzenberger, Bernd; Winker, Peter+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 15 2007::no title+Hastie, T.J.; Tibshirani, R.+Generalized Additive Models+1990::A general bahadur representation of M-estimators and its application to linear regression with nonstochastic designs+He, XM; Shao, QM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1996::Two-step estimation of semiparametric censored regression models+Khan, S; Powell, JL+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 2001::An interior point algorithm for nonlinear quantile regression+Koenker, R; Park, BJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR-APR 1996::Censored quantile regression redux+Koenker, Roger+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+JUL 2008::no title+Loader, C.+Local regression and likelihood+1990::no title+Portnoy, S.+Inconsistency of the Powell estimator: examples+2010::Censored regression quantiles+Portnoy, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2003::CENSORED REGRESSION QUANTILES+POWELL, JL+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 1986::ADDITIVE REGRESSION AND OTHER NONPARAMETRIC MODELS+STONE, CJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1985::OPTIMAL GLOBAL RATES OF CONVERGENCE FOR NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION+STONE, CJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::no title+van der Vaart, A.

For any estimator , its quality is measured by the risk associated with normalized loss functions of linear-linear or inverse-linear form. These functions are possibly asymmetric, with arbitrary slope parameters a and b for and , respectively. Interest in these functions is motivated by their significance and potential uses, which are briefly discussed. Estimators are given for which the risk has an asymptotic value as p -> 0, and which guarantee that, for any pa(0,1), the risk is lower than its asymptotic value.

On the definition of phase and amplitude variability in functional data analysis,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0268-9,DEC 2012,25,13,"We introduce a modeling and mathematical framework in which the problem of registering a functional data set can be consistently set. In detail, we show that the introduction, in a functional data analysis, of a metric/semi-metric and of a group of warping functions, with respect to which the metric/semi-metric is invariant, enables a sound and not ambiguous definition of phase and amplitude variability. Indeed, in this framework, we prove that the analysis of a registered functional data set can be re-interpreted as the analysis of a set of suitable equivalence classes associated to original functions and induced by the group of the warping functions. Moreover, an amplitude-to-total variability index is proposed. This index turns out to be useful in practical situations for measuring to what extent phase variability affects the data and for comparing the effectiveness of different registration methods.","Functional data analysis,Phase variability,Amplitude variability,Registration,Alignment,Synchronization,Warping","MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,CURVE REGISTRATION,REGRESSION,CLASSIFICATION,ALIGNMENT","Vantini, Simone@Politecn Milan, MOX Lab, Dept Math Francesco Brioschi, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Vantini, Simone@Polytechnic University of Milan","Vantini, Simone@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8255-5306","Self-modelling regression for longitudinal data with time-invariant covariates+Altman, NS; Villarreal, JC+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 2004::Self modeling with flexible, random time transformations+Brumback, LC; Lindstrom, MJ+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2004::Robust estimation and classification for functional data via projection-based depth notions+Cuevas, Antonio; Febrero, Manuel; Fraiman, Ricardo+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+SEP 2007::Emerging issues in longitudinal and functional data analysis - Introduction+Davidian, M; Lin, XH; Wang, JL+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2004::DEFINING PROBABILITY DENSITY FOR A DISTRIBUTION OF RANDOM FUNCTIONS+Delaigle, Aurore; Hall, Peter+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2010::The functional nonparametric model and application to spectrometric data+Ferraty, F; Vieu, P+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2002::High-dimensional data: a fascinating statistical challenge+Ferraty, F.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+FEB 2010::no title+Ferraty, F.; Vieu, P.+Nonparametric Functional Data Analysis+2006::no title+Ferraty, F.; Romain, Y.+OXFORD HDB FUNCTIONA+2011::Rate of uniform consistency for nonparametric estimates with functional variables+Ferraty, Frederic; Laksaci, Ali; Tadj, Amel; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 2010::Statistics for functional data+Gonzalez Manteiga, Wenceslao; Vieu, Philippe+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 15 2007::CURVE ALIGNMENT BY MOMENTS+James, Gareth M.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+DEC 2007::Gait-based human recognition by classification of cyclostationary processes on nonlinear shape manifolds+Kaziska, David; Srivastava, Anuj+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2007::Semiparametric nonlinear mixed-effects models and their applications+Ke, CL; Wang, YD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Curve registration by local regression+Kneip, A; Li, X; MacGibbon, KB; et al.+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 2000::Combining Registration and Fitting for Functional Models+Kneip, Alois; Ramsay, James O.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2008::SELF MODELING NONLINEAR REGRESSION+LAWTON, WH; MAGGIO, MS; SYLVESTR.EA+TECHNOMETRICS+1972::NONLINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODELS FOR REPEATED MEASURES DATA+LINDSTROM, MJ; BATES, DM+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1990::Functional convex averaging and synchronization for time-warped random curves+Liu, XL; Muller, HG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2004::no title+Ramsay, J.

Nonparametric tests for stochastic ordering,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0278-7,DEC 2012,53,5,"We present two new tests for stochastic ordering in a standard two-sample scheme. We approach the problem via its reparametrization in terms of Fourier coefficients in some corresponding system of functions and combining the resulting empirical Fourier coefficients. The empirical Fourier coefficients can be seen to be the asymptotically optimal linear rank statistics for the local sequences of nonparametric alternatives related to the introduced system of functions. Therefore, our first construction of the test is via multiple testing. The second test is based on sum of squares of censored empirical Fourier coefficients with the number of summands determined via a new model selection rule. The selection rule is fully automatic. Extensive simulations show that the new solutions improve upon existing tests based on adjusted variants of classical Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling and L (1)-distance-based statistics, among others. We show that both tests control the error of the first kind for any fixed sample sizes and are capable of detecting essentially any alternative as the sample sizes are growing to infinity. We also discuss several aspects of our constructions, including possible efficiency calculations and asymptotic comparisons.","Data-driven test,Linear rank statistic,Model selection criteria,Multiple comparisons,Schwarz BIC,Stochastic dominance,Stochastic order","GOODNESS-OF-FIT,INTERMEDIATE EFFICIENCY,ASYMPTOTIC-DISTRIBUTION,EMPIRICAL PROCESSES,LARGE DEVIATIONS,2-SAMPLE PROBLEM,STATISTICS,DISTRIBUTIONS,DOMINANCE,EXPANSIONS","Ledwina, Teresa@Polish Acad Sci, Inst Math, PL-51617 Wroclaw, Poland::Wylupek, Grzegorz@Polish Acad Sci, Inst Math, PL-51617 Wroclaw, Poland","Ledwina, Teresa@Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences@Polish Academy of Sciences::Wylupek, Grzegorz@Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences@Polish Academy of Sciences",not exist,"Nonparametric tests of stochastic dominance in income distributions+Anderson, G+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 1996::Consistent tests for stochastic dominance+Barrett, GF; Donald, SG+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2003::no title+Behnen, K.; Neuhaus, G.+Rank Tests with Estimated Scores and their Application+1989::NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS - 2-SAMPLE RANK-TESTS+BEHNEN, K+ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGEWANDTE MATHEMATIK UND MECHANIK+1981::Consistent integral-type tests for stochastic dominance+Bennett, CJ.+Working Paper+2008::Testing for goodness of fit: A new approach+BICKEL, P.

Statistical inference on restricted partially linear additive errors-in-variables models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0279-6,DEC 2012,26,10,"As a useful extension of partially linear models and additive models, partially linear additive model has been paid considerable attention in recent years. This paper considers statistical inference for the semiparametric model when the covariates in the linear part are measured with additive error. To test hypothesis on the parametric component, we propose a novel test statistic based on the difference between the corrected residual sums of squares under the null and alternative hypotheses, and show that its limiting distribution is that of a weighted sum of independent standard . We also develop an adjusted test statistic, which has an asymptotically standard chi-squared distribution.

Some recent theory for autoregressive count time series,TEST,10.1007/s11749-012-0296-0,SEP 2012,55,16,"In this paper an overview is given over recent theoretical developments in autoregressive count time series. The focus is on generalized autoregressive models where the autoregressive structure is incorporated via a link function. Starting from an ordinary autoregressive model the difficulties in extending standard theory of statistical inference to count time series are highlighted. Special attention is given to the issues of ergodicity and asymptotic theory of estimation. Two main approaches are mentioned, a perturbation approach and the use of a weak dependence concept. The main emphasis is on the former. Linear as well as log-linear and nonlinear models are treated. It is argued that the developed theory forms a necessary basis for modelling and application of these count time series. The setting of the paper is one of simple models and conditional distributions of Poisson type. But it is claimed that the framework is general enough to handle many extensions with an accompanying flexibility in applications of these models.","Autoregressive,Count time series,Maximum likelihood,Perturbation,Weak dependence","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,GARCH PROCESSES,ERGODICITY,INFERENCE","Tjostheim, Dag@Univ Bergen, Dept Math, N-5008 Bergen, Norway","Tjostheim, Dag@University of Bergen",not exist,"NON-STRONG MIXING AUTOREGRESSIVE PROCESSES+ANDREWS, DWK+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1984::no title+Balakrishnan, N.; Kotz, S.; Johnson, N.

Estimation of and testing for random effects in dynamic panel data models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0259-x,SEP 2012,14,1,"In this article, estimation of moments up to the fourth order of random effects and errors is first investigated for dynamic panel data models. Using the QR decomposition of a matrix, the moments of random individual effects and errors are estimated without affecting each other so that the estimation procedure is simple to implement, and the asymptotic behavior of estimation is derived. On the basis of these estimations, we construct a test for the existence of individual effects. This test is asymptotically normally distributed under the null hypothesis without any distributional assumptions on the individual effects and errors other than moments. A power study shows that our test is able to detect local alternatives that are distinct from the null at a parametric rate. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out for illustration.","Dynamic panel data,Estimation of moments,Random effects,Testing for random effects",MIXED MODELS,"Wu, Jianhong@Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China::Zhu, Lixing@Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Yunnan Univ Econ & Finance, Kunming, Peoples R China","Wu, Jianhong@Zhejiang Gongshang University::Zhu, Lixing@Hong Kong Baptist University@Yunnan University of Finance & Economics","HKBU, Mathematics@B-5086-2009::Zhu, Lixing@B-7199-2009::Zhu, Lixing@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1611-4267","SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::no title+Baltagi, Badi H.+Econometric Analysis of Panel Data+2005::GMM estimation with persistent panel data: an application to production functions+Blundell, R.; Bond, S.+Econometric Reviews+2000::Nonparametric estimation of varying coefficient dynamic panel data models+Cai, Zongwu; Li, Qi+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+OCT 2008::no title+Gentle, J.

Testing for one-sided alternatives in nonparametric censored regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0260-4,SEP 2012,17,0,"Assume that we have two populations (X (1),Y (1)) and (X (2),Y (2)) satisfying two general nonparametric regression models Y (j) =m (j) (X (j) )+epsilon (j) , j=1,2, where m(a <...) is a smooth location function, epsilon (j) has zero location and the response Y (j) is possibly right-censored. In this paper, we propose to test the null hypothesis H (0):m (1)=m (2) versus the one-sided alternative H (1):m (1)< m (2). We introduce two test statistics for which we obtain the asymptotic normality under the null and the alternative hypotheses. Although the tests are based on nonparametric techniques, they can detect any local alternative converging to the null hypothesis at the parametric rate n (-1/2). The practical performance of a bootstrap version of the tests is investigated in a simulation study.

Assessment of variance components in nonlinear mixed-effects elliptical models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0262-2,SEP 2012,18,6,"The issue of assessing variance components is essential in deciding on the inclusion of random effects in the context of mixed models. In this work we discuss this problem by supposing nonlinear elliptical models for correlated data by using the score-type test proposed in Silvapulle and Silvapulle (1995). Being asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio test and only requiring the estimation under the null hypothesis, this test provides a fairly easy computable alternative for assessing one-sided hypotheses in the context of the marginal model. Taking into account the possible non-normal distribution, we assume that the joint distribution of the response variable and the random effects lies in the elliptical class, which includes light-tailed and heavy-tailed distributions such as Student-t, power exponential, logistic, generalized Student-t, generalized logistic, contaminated normal, and the normal itself, among others. We compare the sensitivity of the score-type test under normal, Student-t and power exponential models for the kinetics data set discussed in Vonesh and Carter (1992) and fitted using the model presented in Russo et al. (2009). Also, a simulation study is performed to analyze the consequences of the kurtosis misspecification.","Nonlinear models,Elliptical distributions,Hypothesis testing,Variance components,Score tests","LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS,REGRESSION","Russo, Cibele M.@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Ciencias Matemat & Comp, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil::Aoki, Reiko@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Ciencias Matemat & Comp, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil::Paula, Gilberto A.@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Matemat & Estat, BR-05314970 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Russo, Cibele M.@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Aoki, Reiko@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Paula, Gilberto A.@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Russo, Cibele@E-6981-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1356-0245::Inst Cien Matematicas Computacao, ICMC/USP@D-8320-2017::Paula, Gilberto@D-2924-2012","Restricted methods in symmetrical linear regression models+Cysneiros, FJA; Paula, GA+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 1 2005::Likelihood ratio tests for variance components in linear mixed models+Giampaoli, Viviana; Singer, Julio M.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+APR 1 2009::A multivariate generalization of the power exponential family of distributions+Gomez, E; Gomez-Villegas, MA; Marin, JM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1998::ROBUST STATISTICAL MODELING USING THE T-DISTRIBUTION+LANGE, KL; LITTLE, RJA; TAYLOR, JMG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1989::On Variance Components in Semiparametric Mixed Models for Longitudinal Data+Li, Zaixing; Zhu, Lixing+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2010::Local sensitivity and diagnostic tests+Magnus, Jan R.; Vasnev, Andrey L.+ECONOMETRICS JOURNAL+2007::Estimation in nonlinear mixed-effects models using heavy-tailed distributions+Meza, Cristian; Osorio, Felipe; De la Cruz, Rolando+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2012::Assessment of local influence in elliptical linear models with longitudinal structure+Osorio, Felipe; Paula, Gilberto A.; Galea, Manuel+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 15 2007::A note on influence diagnostics in nonlinear mixed-effects elliptical models+Patriota, Alexandre G.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 1 2011::Influence diagnostics in nonlinear mixed-effects elliptical models+Russo, Cibele M.; Paula, Gilberto A.; Aoki, Reiko+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 1 2009::no title+Russo, CM.+Modelos nao lineares elipticos para dados correlacionados+2010::Assessment of variance components in elliptical linear mixed models+Savalli, C; Paula, GA; Cysneiros, FJA+STATISTICAL MODELLING+MAR 2006::ASYMPTOTIC-DISTRIBUTION OF TEST STATISTICS IN THE ANALYSIS OF MOMENT STRUCTURES UNDER INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS+SHAPIRO, A+BIOMETRIKA+1985::A SCORE TEST AGAINST ONE-SIDED ALTERNATIVES+SILVAPULLE, MJ; SILVAPULLE, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1995::The use of score tests for inference on variance components+Verbeke, G; Molenberghs, G+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2003::MIXED-EFFECTS NONLINEAR-REGRESSION FOR UNBALANCED REPEATED MEASURES+VONESH, EF; CARTER, RL+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1992::Generalization of likelihood ratio tests under nonstandard conditions+Vu, HTV; Zhou, S+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1997::Variance Component Testing in Generalized Linear Mixed Models for Longitudinal/Clustered Data and other Related Topics+Zhang, Daowen; Lin, Xihong+RANDOM EFFECT AND LATENT VARIABLE MODEL SELECTION+2008"
"Interval estimation of the tail index of a GARCH(1,1) model",TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0264-0,SEP 2012,22,7,"It is known that the tail index of a GARCH model is determined by a moment equation, which involves the underlying unknown parameters of the model. A tail index estimator can therefore be constructed by solving the sample moment equation with the unknown parameters being replaced by its quasi-maximum likelihood estimates (QMLE). To construct a confidence interval for the tail index, one needs to estimate the non-trivial asymptotic variance of the QMLE. In this paper, an empirical likelihood method is proposed for interval estimation of the tail index. One advantage of the proposed method is that interval estimation can still be achieved without having to estimate the complicated asymptotic variance. A simulation study confirms the advantage of the proposed method.","Empirical likelihood,GARCH model,Tail index","EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD,EQUATIONS,INFERENCE","Chan, Ngai Hang@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Peng, Liang@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Math, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Zhang, Rongmao@Zhejiang Univ, Dept Math, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chan, Ngai Hang@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Peng, Liang@University System of Georgia@Georgia Institute of Technology::Zhang, Rongmao@Zhejiang University",not exist,"Regular variation of GARCH processes+Basrak, B; Davis, RA; Mikosch, T+STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+MAY 2002::GARCH processes: structure and estimation+Berkes, I; Horvath, L; Kokoszka, P+BERNOULLI+APR 2003::Estimation of the maximal moment exponent of a GARCH(1,1) sequence+Berkes, I; Horvath, L; Kokoszka, P+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 2003::A review on empirical likelihood methods for regression+Chen, Song Xi; Van Keilegom, Ingrid+TEST+NOV 2009::no title+Cont, R.; Tankov, P.+Financial Modeling with Jump Processes+2004::no title+de Haan,, L.; Ferreira,, A.+Extreme value theory - An introduction+2006::Weighted approximations of tail processes for beta-mixing random variables+Drees, H+ANNALS OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+NOV 2000::Inference in ARCH and GARCH models with heavy-tailed errors+Hall, P; Yao, QW+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2003::no title+Hall, P; Heyde, CC.+Martingale Limit Theory and Its Application+1980::SIMPLE GENERAL APPROACH TO INFERENCE ABOUT TAIL OF A DISTRIBUTION+HILL, BM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1975::Estimation of tail thickness parameters from GJR-GARCH models+Iglesias, EM; Linton, OB.+Working Paper 09-47, Economic Series (26)+2009::RANDOM DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS AND RENEWAL THEORY FOR PRODUCTS OF RANDOM MATRICES+KESTEN, H+ACTA MATHEMATICA+1973::Self-weighted and local quasi-maximum likelihood estimators for ARMA-GARCH/IGARCH models+Ling, Shiqing+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 2007::Stable limits of martingale transforms with application to the estimation of Garch parameters+Mikosch, T; Straumann, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2006::Limit theory for the sample autocorrelations and extremes of a GARCH (1,1) process+Mikosch, T; Starica, C+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2000::STATIONARITY AND PERSISTENCE IN THE GARCH(1,1) MODEL+NELSON, DB+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+SEP 1990::EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD RATIO CONFIDENCE-REGIONS+OWEN, A+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1990::no title+Owen, A.

On extremal dependence: some contributions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0261-3,SEP 2012,22,5,"The usual coefficients of tail dependence are based on exceedances of high values. These extremal events are useful and widely used in literature but an adverse situation may also occur with the upcrossing of a high level. In this context we define upcrossings-tail dependence coefficients and analyze all types of dependence coming out. We will prove that these coefficients are related to multivariate tail dependence coefficients already known in literature. We shall see that the upcrossings-tail dependence coefficients have the interesting feature of congregating both ""temporal"" and ""spatial"" dependence.

The coefficients of tail dependence can also be applied to stationary sequences and hence measure the tail dependence in time. Results concerning connections with the extremal index and the upcrossings index as well as with local dependence conditions will be stated. Several illustrative examples will be exploited and a small note on inference will be given by presenting estimators derived from the stated results and respective properties.","Extreme values,Measures of tail dependence,Asymptotic independence","TAIL-DEPENDENCE,INDEPENDENCE,INDEX","Ferreira, Marta@U Minho, DMAT CMAT, Braga, Portugal::Ferreira, Helena@U Beira Interior, Dep Mat, Covilha, Portugal","Ferreira, Marta@Universidade do Minho::Ferreira, Helena@Universidade da Beira Interior","Ferreira, Marta@C-2158-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7247-3825::Ferreira, Helena@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9392-7259","AN EXTREMAL MARKOVIAN SEQUENCE+ALPUIM, MT+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+JUN 1989::A Comparison of Methods for Estimating the Extremal Index+Ancona-Navarrete, M.A.; Tawn, J.A.+Extremes+2000::no title+Billingsley, Patrick.+Convergence of Probability Measures+1968::no title+Canto e Castro, L.+Sobre a Teoria Assintotica de Extremos+1992::CALCULATING THE EXTREMAL INDEX FOR A CLASS OF STATIONARY-SEQUENCES+CHERNICK, MR; HSING, TL; MCCORMICK, WP+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+DEC 1991::Dependence Measures for Extreme Value Analysis+Coles, S.; Hefferman, J.; Tawn, J.+Extremes+1999::Bivariate tall estimation: dependence in asymptotic independence+Draisma, G; Drees, H; Ferreira, A; et al.+BERNOULLI+APR 2004::Duration of extremes at sea+Draisma, G.+Parametric and semi-parametric methods in E.V.T+2001::Extreme quantile estimation for dependent data, with applications to finance+Drees, H+BERNOULLI+AUG 2003::The upcrossings index and the extremal index+Ferreira, H.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+DEC 2006::Dependence between two Multivariate Extremes+Ferreira, H.+Statistics and Probability Letters+2011::On tail dependence: a characterization for first order max-autoregressive processes+Ferreira, M.+Notes and communications of CEAUL+2011::Tail and dependence behavior of levels that persist for a fixed period of time+Ferreira, Marta; Canto e Castro, Luisa+EXTREMES+JUN 2008::Estimating the tail-dependence coefficient: Properties and pitfalls+Frahm, G; Junker, M; Schmidt, R+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+AUG 23 2005::Asymptotically (in)dependent multivariate maxima of moving maxima processes+Heffernan, J.E.; Tawn, J.A.; Zhang, Z.+Extremes+2007::On exceedance point process for stationary sequences under mild oscillation restrictions+Leadbetter, M.

Conditional independences are captured by what we name regression graphs, provided the generated distribution shares some properties with a joint Gaussian distribution. Regression graphs extend purely directed, acyclic graphs by two types of undirected graph, one type for components of joint responses and the other for components of the context vector variable. We review the special features and the history of regression graphs, prove criteria for Markov equivalence and discuss the notion of a simpler statistical covering model. Knowledge of Markov equivalence provides alternative interpretations of a given sequence of regressions, is essential for machine learning strategies and permits to use the simple graphical criteria of regression graphs on graphs for which the corresponding criteria are in general more complex. Under the known conditions that a Markov equivalent directed acyclic graph exists for any given regression graph, we give a polynomial time algorithm to find one such graph.","Chain graphs,Concentration graphs,Covariance graphs,Graphical Markov models,Independence graphs,Intervention models,Labelled trees,Lattice conditional independence models,Structural equation models","SEEMINGLY UNRELATED REGRESSIONS,GRAPH MARKOV-MODELS,CONDITIONAL-INDEPENDENCE,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,CHAIN GRAPHS,COVARIANCE-SELECTION,EQUIVALENCE CLASSES,MULTIPLICATIVE MODELS,TRIANGULAR SYSTEMS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD","Wermuth, Nanny@Chalmers Tech Univ, Dept Math, Gothenburg, Sweden@Int Agcy Res Canc, F-69372 Lyon, France::Sadeghi, Kayvan@Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England","Wermuth, Nanny@World Health Organization@International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)@Chalmers University of Technology::Sadeghi, Kayvan@University of Oxford",not exist,"MARKOV EQUIVALENCE FOR ANCESTRAL GRAPHS+Ali, R.

Optimal significance analysis of microarray data in a class of tests whose null statistic can be constructed,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0243-5,JUN 2012,21,0,"Microarray data often consist of a large number of genes and a small number of replicates. We have examined testing the null hypothesis of equality of mean for detecting differentially expressed genes. The p-value for each gene is often estimated using permutation samples not only for the target gene but also for other genes. This method has been widely used and discussed. However, direct use of the permutation method for the p-value estimation may not work well, because two types of genes are mixed in the sample; some genes are differentially expressed, whereas others are not. To overcome this difficulty, various methods for appropriately generating null permutation samples have been proposed. In this paper, we consider two classes of test statistics that are naturally modified to null statistics. We then obtain the uniformly most powerful (UMP) unbiased tests among these classes. If the underlying distribution is symmetric, the UMP unbiased test statistic is similar to that proposed by Pan (Bioinformatics 19:1333-1340, 2003). Under another condition, the UMP unbiased test statistic has a different formula with one more degree of freedom and therefore is expected to give a more powerful test and a more accurate p-value estimation from a modified null statistic. In microarray data, because the number of replicates is often small, differences in the degree of freedom will produce large effects on the power of test and the variance of the p-value estimation. Some simulation studies and real data analyses are illustrated to investigate the performances of the methods.","Microarray data,Multiple test,Null statistic,Small sample,Uniformly most powerful unbiased test","DIFFERENTIAL GENE-EXPRESSION,OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ARRAYS,PERMUTATION","Fujisawa, Hironori@Inst Stat Math, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908562, Japan::Sakaguchi, Takayuki@Oita Univ Nursing & Hlth Sci, Oita 8701201, Japan","Fujisawa, Hironori@Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS)@Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM)::Sakaguchi, Takayuki@Oita University",not exist,"A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::Preferred analysis methods for Affymetrix GeneChips revealed by a wholly defined control dataset+Choe, SE; Boutros, M; Michelson, AM; et al.+GENOME BIOLOGY+2005::Empirical Bayes analysis of a microarray experiment+Efron, B; Tibshirani, R; Storey, JD; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Construction of null statistics in permutation-based multiple testing for multi-factorial microarray experiments+Gao, X+BIOINFORMATICS+JUN 15 2006::Bayesian robust inference for differential gene expression in microarrays with multiple samples+Gottardo, R; Raftery, AE; Yeung, KY; et al.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2006::ON ROBUSTNESS OF T2/0 TEST IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WHEN VARIANCE-COVARIANCE MATRICES ARE NOT EQUAL+ITO, K; SCHULL, WJ+BIOMETRIKA+1964::no title+Lehmann, E; Romano, J.+Testing Statistical Hypotheses+2005::Expression monitoring by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays+Lockhart, DJ; Dong, HL; Byrne, MC; et al.+NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY+DEC 1996::A simple implementation of a normal mixture approach to differential gene expression in multiclass microarrays+McLachlan, G.

On Holder fields clustering,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0244-4,JUN 2012,37,4,"Based on n randomly drawn vectors in a Hilbert space, we study the k-means clustering scheme. Here, clustering is performed by computing the Voronoi partition associated with centers that minimize an empirical criterion, called distorsion. The performance of the method is evaluated by comparing the theoretical distorsion of empirical optimal centers to the theoretical optimal distorsion. Our first result states that, provided that the underlying distribution satisfies an exponential moment condition, an upper bound for the above performance criterion is . Then, motivated by a broad range of applications, we focus on the case where the data are real-valued random fields. Assuming that they share a Holder property in quadratic mean, we construct a numerically simple k-means algorithm based on a discretized version of the data. With a judicious choice of the discretization, we prove that the performance of this algorithm matches the performance of the classical algorithm.","Clustering,k-means,Unsupervised learning,Random fields,Hilbert space,Empirical risk minimization","EMPIRICAL QUANTIZER DESIGN,DISTORTION","Cadre, Benoit@UEB, ENS Cachan Bretagne, CNRS, IRMAR, F-35170 Bruz, France::Paris, Quentin@UEB, ENS Cachan Bretagne, CNRS, IRMAR, F-35170 Bruz, France","Cadre, Benoit@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Paris, Quentin@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)",not exist,"Convergence of vector quantizers with applications to optimal quantization+Abaya, EA; Wise, GL.+SIAM J Appl Math+1984::A tail inequality for suprema of unbounded empirical processes with applications to Markov chains+Adamczak, R.+Electron J Probab+2008::Improved convergence rates in empirical vector quantizer design+Antos, A; Gyorfi, L; Gyorgy, A.+IEEE Trans Inf Theory+2005::Improved minimax bounds on the test and training distortion of empirically designed vector quantizers+Antos, A.+IEEE Trans Inf Theory+2005::The minimax distortion redundancy in empirical quantizer design+Bartlett, PL; Linder, T; Lugosi, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+SEP 1998::On the performance of clustering in Hilbert spaces+Biau, G; Devroye, L; Lugosi, G.+IEEE Trans Inf Theory+2008::Exact confidence intervals for the Hurst parameter of a fractional Brownian motion+Breton, JC; Nourdin, I; Peccati, G.+Electron J Stat+2009::The distortion of vector quantizers trained on n vectors decreases to the optimum as Op(1/n).+Chou, P.

Testing composite hypotheses about discrete ergodic processes,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0245-3,JUN 2012,19,6,"Given a discrete-valued sample X (1),aEuro broken vertical bar,X (n) , we wish to decide whether it was generated by a distribution belonging to a family H (0), or it was generated by a distribution belonging to a family H (1). In this work we assume that all distributions are stationary ergodic and do not make any further assumptions (in particular, no independence or mixing rate assumptions). We find some necessary and some sufficient conditions, formulated in terms of the topological properties of H (0) and H (1), for the existence of a consistent test. For the case where H (1) is the complement of H (0) (to the set of all stationary ergodic processes), these necessary and sufficient conditions coincide, thereby providing a complete characterization of families of processes membership to which can be consistently tested, against their complement, based on sampling. This criterion includes as special cases several known and some new results on testing for membership to various parametric families, as well as testing identity, independence, and other hypotheses.","Hypothesis testing,Property testing,Stationary ergodic time series,Distributional distance",STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,"Ryabko, Daniil@INRIA Lille Nord Europe, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France","Ryabko, Daniil@Inria",not exist,"STATISTICAL-INFERENCE ABOUT MARKOV-CHAINS+ANDERSON, TW; GOODMAN, LA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1957::On the asymptotic properties of a nonparametric L-1-test statistic of homogeneity+Biau, G; Gyorfi, L+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+NOV 2005::STATISTICAL-METHODS IN MARKOV-CHAINS+BILLINGSLEY, P+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1961::no title+Billingsley, P.+Ergodic Theory and Information+1965::The consistency of the BIC Markov order estimator+Csiszar, I; Shields, PC+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2000::no title+CSISZAR I+FDN TRENDS COMMUNICA+2004::Information-type measures of difference of probability distributions and indirect observations+Csiszar, I.+Stud.

A multiple time scale survival model with a cure fraction,TEST,10.1007/s11749-011-0247-1,JUN 2012,36,5,"Many recent survival studies propose modeling data with a cure fraction, i.e., data in which part of the population is not susceptible to the event of interest. This event may occur more than once for the same individual (recurrent event). We then have a scenario of recurrent event data in the presence of a cure fraction, which may appear in various areas such as oncology, finance, industries, among others. This paper proposes a multiple time scale survival model to analyze recurrent events using a cure fraction. The objective is analyzing the efficiency of certain interventions so that the studied event will not happen again in terms of covariates and censoring. All estimates were obtained using a sampling-based approach, which allows information to be input beforehand with lower computational effort. Simulations were done based on a clinical scenario in order to observe some frequentist properties of the estimation procedure in the presence of small and moderate sample sizes. An application of a well-known set of real mammary tumor data is provided.","Cure fraction modeling,Berkson-Gage model,Recurrent events,Bayesian approach","LONG-TERM SURVIVORS,MIXTURE-MODELS,MONTE-CARLO,REGRESSION","Louzada, Francisco@Univ Sao Paulo, SME ICMC, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil::Cobre, Juliana@Univ Sao Paulo, SME ICMC, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Louzada, Francisco@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Cobre, Juliana@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Cobre, Juliana@E-8460-2011::Louzada, Francisco@E-8463-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7815-9554::Inst Cien Matematicas Computacao, ICMC/USP@D-8320-2017","SURVIVAL CURVE FOR CANCER PATIENTS FOLLOWING TREATMENT+BERKSON, J; GAGE, RP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1952::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES OF THE PROPORTION OF PATIENTS CURED BY CANCER THERAPY+BOAG, JW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1949::UNDERSTANDING THE METROPOLIS-HASTINGS ALGORITHM+CHIB, S; GREENBERG, E+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1995::A sampling-based approach for a hybrid scale intensity model+Cobre, J; Louzada-Neto, F.+J Stat, Adv Theory Appl+2009::Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics: A comparative review+Cowles, MK; Carlin, BP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::The statistical analysis of dependencies in point process+Cox, D.

6 Censored linear model in high dimensions Penalised linear regression on high-dimensional data with left-censored response variable,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0441-7,MAR 2016,22,0,"Censored data are quite common in statistics and have been studied in depth in the last years [for some references, see Powell (J Econom 25(3): 303-325, 1984), Murphy et al.

High-dimensional models are in some way more complex than their low-dimensional versions, therefore some different techniques are required. For the linear case, appropriate estimators based on penalised regression have been developed in the last years [see for example Bickel et al. (Ann Stat 37(4): 1705-1732, 2009), Koltchinskii (Bernoulli 15: 799-828, 2009)]. In particular, in sparse contexts, the l(1)-penalised regression (also known as LASSO) [see Tibshirani (J R Stat Soc Ser B 58: 267-288, 1996), Bhlmann and van de Ge (Statistics for high-dimensional data. Springer, Heidelberg, 2011) and reference therein] performs very well. Only few theoretical work was done to analyse censored linear models in a high-dimensional context. We therefore consider a high-dimensional censored linear model, where the response variable is left censored. We propose a new estimator, which aims to work with high-dimensional linear censored data.

Semi-parametric estimation and forecasting for exogenous log-GARCH models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0442-6,MAR 2016,34,0,"Advanced computing and processing techniques have yielded abundant information for financial time series forecasting. It is, therefore, natural to ask for possible extensions of time series models to accommodate the wealth of information. In this article, we develop a new model for financial volatility estimation and forecasting by incorporating exogenous covariates in a semi-parametric log-GARCH model. With additional information, we gain an increased prediction power. We propose a quasi-maximum likelihood procedure via spline smoothing technique. Consistent estimators and asymptotic normality are obtained under mild regularity conditions. Simulation experiments provide strong evidence that corroborates the asymptotic theories. Additionally, an application to SPY index data demonstrates strong competitive advantage of our model comparing with GARCH(1,1) and log-GARCH(1,1) models.","Financial volatility,Log-GARCH,Exogenous variable,Semi-parametric regression,Spline,Quasi-likelihood estimation","AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY,ASYMPTOTIC THEORY,VOLATILITY MODELS,STOCK-MARKET,REGIME,ARCH,SHOCKS,QMLE,OIL","Chen, Ming@Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA::Song, Qiongxia@Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA","Chen, Ming@University of Texas Dallas@University of Texas System::Song, Qiongxia@University of Texas Dallas@University of Texas System",not exist,"Answering the skeptics: Yes, standard volatility models do provide accurate forecasts+Andersen, TG; Bollerslev, T+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 1998::Measuring economic policy uncertainty+Baker, S.; Bloom, N.; Davis, S.+Chicago Booth Research Paper 13-02+2013::GENERALIZED AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY+BOLLERSLEV, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1986::An algorithm for nonparametric GARCH modelling+Buhlmann, P; McNeil, AJ+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+OCT 28 2002::A MARKOV MODEL OF SWITCHING-REGIME ARCH+CAI, J+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1994::Estimation in an additive model when the components are linked parametrically+Carroll, RJ; Hardle, W; Mammen, E+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 2002::ECONOMIC FORCES AND THE STOCK-MARKET+CHEN, NF; ROLL, R; ROSS, SA+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+JUL 1986::Varying coefficient GARCH models+Cizek, P.; Spokoiny, V.+HDB FINANCIAL TIME S+2009::SPECULATIVE DYNAMICS+CUTLER, DM; POTERBA, JM; SUMMERS, LH+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+MAY 1991::Quasi maximum likelihood estimation of GARCH models with heavy-tailed likelihoods+Fan, J; Qi, L; Xiu, D.+WORKING PAPER SERIES+2013::GARCH models without positivity constraints: Exponential or log GARCH?+Francq, Christian; Wintenberger, Olivier; Zakoiean, Jean-Michel+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2013::no title+Gogineni, S.; Michael, F.+The Stock Market Reaction to Oil Price Changes.+2008::Modeling the conditional distribution of interest rates as a regime-switching process+Gray, SF+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+SEP 1996::AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND CHANGES IN REGIME+HAMILTON, JD; SUSMEL, R+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP-OCT 1994::Asymptotic Theory for the QMLE in GARCH-X Models With Stationary and Nonstationary Covariates+Han, Heejoon; Kristensen, Dennis+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2014::ARCH/GARCH with persistent covariate: Asymptotic theory of MLE+Han, Heejoon; Park, Joon Y.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR 2012::Time series properties of ARCH processes with persistent covariates+Han, Heejoon; Park, Joon Y.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 2008::A forecast comparison of volatility models: Does anything beat a GARCH(1,1)?+Hansen, PR; Lunde, A+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+DEC 2005::no title+Hastie, T.J.; Tibshirani, R.+Generalized Additive Models+1990::Identification of non-linear additive autoregressive models+Huang, JHZ; Yang, LJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::Energy shocks and financial markets+Huang, RD; Masulis, RW; Stoll, HR+JOURNAL OF FUTURES MARKETS+FEB 1996::Finite sample theory of qmles in arch models with an exogenous variable in the condi-tional variance equation+Iglesias, EM.+Stud Nonlinear Dyn E+2009::Asymptotic inference for nonstationary GARCH+Jensen, ST; Rahbek, A+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+DEC 2004::Asymptotic normality of the QMLE estimator of arch in the nonstationary case+Jensen, ST; Rahbek, A+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2004::Oil and the stock markets+Jones, CM; Kaul, G+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUN 1996::Improving GARCH volatility forecasts with regime-switching GARCH+Klaassen, Franc+EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS+MAR 2002::ASYMPTOTIC THEORY FOR THE GARCH(1,1) QUASI-MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR+LEE, SW; HANSEN, BE+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+MAR 1994::Oil price shocks and stock market activity+Sadorsky, P+ENERGY ECONOMICS+OCT 1999::ADDITIVE REGRESSION AND OTHER NONPARAMETRIC MODELS+STONE, CJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1985::ESTIMATION AND VARIABLE SELECTION FOR GENERALIZED ADDITIVE PARTIAL LINEAR MODELS+Wang, Li; Liu, Xiang; Liang, Hua; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2011::Spline-backfitted kernel smoothing of nonlinear additive autoregression model+Wang, Li; Yang, Lijian+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2007::EFFICIENT SEMIPARAMETRIC GARCH MODELING OF FINANCIAL VOLATILITY+Wang, Li; Feng, Cong; Song, Qiongxia; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2012::A semiparametric GARCH model for foreign exchange volatility+Yang, LJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 2006::Semiparametric arch-x model for leverage effect and long memory in stock return volatility+Zhang, S; Han, H.+J Econ Theory Econom+2014"
Bayesian nonparametric location-scale-shape mixtures,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0446-2,MAR 2016,31,0,"Discrete mixture models are one of the most successful approaches for density estimation. Under a Bayesian nonparametric framework, Dirichlet process location-scale mixture of Gaussian kernels is the golden standard, both having nice theoretical properties and computational tractability. In this paper we explore the use of the skew-normal kernel, which can naturally accommodate several degrees of skew-ness by the use of a third parameter. The choice of this kernel function allows us to formulate nonparametric location-scale-shape mixture prior with desirable theoretical properties and good performance in different applications. Efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms are also discussed and the performance of the methods are tested through simulations and applications to galaxy velocity and fertility data.

Time-varying extreme pattern with dynamic models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0444-4,MAR 2016,26,2,"This paper is concerned with the analysis of time series data with timevarying extreme pattern. This is achieved via a model formulation that considers separately the central part and the tail of the distributions, using a two-component mixture model. Extremes beyond a threshold are assumed to follow a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). Temporal dependence is induced by allowing the GPD parameters to vary with time. Temporal variation and dependence is introduced at a latent level via the novel use of dynamic linear models (DLM). Novelty lies in the time variation of the shape and scale parameter of the resulting distribution. These changes in limiting regimes as time changes reflect better the data behavior, with important gains in estimation and interpretation. The central part follows a nonparametric mixture approach. The uncertainty about the threshold is explicitly considered. Posterior inference is performed through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. A variety of scenarios can be entertained and include the possibility of alternation of presence and absence of a finite upper limit of the distribution for different time periods. Simulations are carried out in order to analyze the performance of our proposed model. We also apply the proposed model to financial time series: returns of Petrobras stocks and SP500 index. Results show advantage of our proposal over currently entertained models such as stochastic volatility, with improved estimation of high quantiles and extremes.","GPD,Bayesian,Nonparametric,MCMC","THRESHOLD ESTIMATION,DEPENDENCE,INFERENCE,VALUES","do Nascimento, Fernando Ferraz@Univ Fed Piaui, Curso Estat, Campus Minist Petronio Portela,CCN2, BR-64049550 Teresina, Brazil::Gamerman, Dani@Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Metodos Estat, Caixa Postal 68530, BR-21945970 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil::Lopes, Hedibert Freitas@INSPER Inst Educ & Res, Rua Quata 300, BR-04546042 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","do Nascimento, Fernando Ferraz@Universidade Federal do Piaui::Gamerman, Dani@Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro::Lopes, Hedibert Freitas@Insper","Lopes, Hedibert@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8429-0353","Bayesian analysis of extreme events with threshold estimation+Behrens, CN; Lopes, HF; Gamerman, D+STATISTICAL MODELLING+OCT 2004::Simulation-based sequential analysis of Markov switching stochastic volatility models+Carvalho, Carlos M.; Lopes, Hedibert F.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 15 2007::no title+Coles, SG.+Extreme value theory an applications+2001::Bayesian methods in extreme value modelling: A review and new developments+Coles, SG; Powell, EA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1996::Modelling extremes of the areal rainfall process+Coles, SG; Tawn, JA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::A SURVEY OF SPATIAL EXTREMES: MEASURING SPATIAL DEPENDENCE AND MODELING SPATIAL EFFECTS+Cooley, Daniel; Cisewski, Jessi; Erhardt, Robert J.; et al.+REVSTAT-STATISTICAL JOURNAL+MAR 2012::A BAYESIAN PREDICTIVE APPROACH TO DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS IN A MIXTURE DISTRIBUTION+DEY, DK; KUO, L; SAHU, SK+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 1995::Change point analysis of extreme values+Dierckx, G.; Teugels, J.

Stochastic comparisons of generalized mixtures and coherent systems,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0443-5,MAR 2016,31,16,"A distribution function F is a generalized mixture of the distribution functions F-1, ..., F-k if F = w(1)F(1)+ ... + w(k) F-k, where w(1),..., w(k) are some real numbers (weights) which should satisfy w(1) + ... + w(k) = 1. If all the weights are positive, then we have a classical finite mixture. If some weights are negative, then we have a negative mixture. Negative mixtures appear in different applied probability models (order statistics, estimators, coherent systems, etc.). The conditions to obtain stochastic comparisons of classical (positive) mixtures are well known in the literature. However, for negative mixtures, there are only results for the usual stochastic order. In this paper, conditions for hazard rate and likelihood ratio comparisons of generalized mixtures are obtained. These theoretical results are applied in this paper to study distribution-free comparisons of coherent systems using their representations as generalized mixtures. They can also be applied to other probability models in which the generalized mixtures appear.","Generalized mixtures,Stochastic comparisons,Coherent systems,Hazard rate","STEP-STRESS MODEL,HYBRID CENSORED-DATA,EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION,EXACT INFERENCE,DEPENDENT COMPONENTS,RESIDUAL LIFETIMES,ORDER-STATISTICS,DISTRIBUTIONS,RELIABILITY,BATHTUB","Navarro, Jorge@Univ Murcia, Fac Matemat, E-30100 Murcia, Spain","Navarro, Jorge@University of Murcia",not exist,"A SURVEY OF NETWORK RELIABILITY AND DOMINATION THEORY+AGRAWAL, A; BARLOW, RE+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+1984::Exact inference for a simple step-stress model from the exponential distribution under time constraint+Balakrishnan, N.; Xie, Qihao; Kundu, D.+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 2009::Progressive censoring from heterogeneous distributions with applications to robustness+Balakrishnan, N.; Cramer, Erhard+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 2008::Art of Progressive Censoring: Applications to Reliability and Quality+Balakrishnan, N; Cramer, E+ART OF PROGRESSIVE CENSORING: APPLICATIONS TO RELIABILITY AND QUALITY+2014::Exact inference for a simple step-stress model with Type-I hybrid censored data from the exponential distribution+Balakrishnan, N.; Me, Qihao+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 1 2007::Exact inference for a simple step-stress model with Type-II hybrid censored data from the exponential distribution+Balakrishnan, N.; Xie, Qihao+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 2007::no title+Barlow, R.

Global and local distance-based generalized linear models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0447-1,MAR 2016,45,2,"This paper introduces local distance-based generalized linear models. These models extend (weighted) distance-based linear models first to the generalized linear model framework. Then, a nonparametric version of these models is proposed by means of local fitting. Distances between individuals are the only predictor information needed to fit these models. Therefore, they are applicable, among others, to mixed (qualitative and quantitative) explanatory variables or when the regressor is of functional type. An implementation is provided by the R package dbstats, which also implements other distance-based prediction methods.

To avoid this, he solves a continuous nonlinear programming problem and then he rounds off the number of replicates of each experiment. The procedure provided in this paper reduces dramatically the computational efforts in computing optimal approximate designs. It is based on a specific formulation of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the full-information maximum likelihood estimators, which simplifies the calculations. The design obtained for estimating the structural parameters of the numerical example by this procedure is not only easier to compute, but also more efficient than the design provided by Conlisk.","Approximate design,Cost constraints,Exact design,L-optimal design,Multiplicative algorithm,Simultaneous equations,Structural equations",SYSTEMS,"Casero-Alonso, Victor@Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Math Appl Sci & Engn, Dept Math, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain::Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Math Appl Sci & Engn, Dept Math, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain","Casero-Alonso, Victor@Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha::Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha","Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@A-2412-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7502-8188::Casero Alonso, Victor Manuel@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8165-5858","Optimal designs for some stochastic processes whose covariance is a function of the mean+Amo-Salas, Mariano; Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus; Porcu, Emilio+TEST+MAR 2013::CONVERGENT DESIGN SEQUENCES, FOR SUFFICIENTLY REGULAR OPTIMALITY CRITERIA+ATWOOD, CL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1976::Experimental designs in triangular simultaneous equations models+Casero-Alonso, Victor; Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAY 2015::no title+CONLISK J+J ECON+1979::CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION OF EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN+COOK, D; FEDOROV, V+STATISTICS+1995::no title+Duncan, Otis D.+Introduction to Structural Equation Models+1975::STRUCTURAL EQUATION METHODS IN SOCIAL-SCIENCES+GOLDBERGER, AS+ECONOMETRICA+1972::Efficiencies of rounded optimal approximate designs for small samples+Imhof, L; Lopez-Fidalgo, J; Wong, WK+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+NOV 2001::no title+Joreskog, K.

It is well known that this maximum, conveniently normalized, converges in law to a Gumbel random variable; however, numerical and simulation studies show that the norming constants that are usually suggested are inaccurate for moderate or even large sample sizes. In this paper, we propose, for Gamma laws (in particular, for a law) and other Weibull-like distributions, other norming constants computed with the asymptotics of the Lambert function that significantly improve the accuracy of the approximation to the Gumbel law.","Weibull-like distributions,Gamma distributions,Extreme value theory,Lambert function",,"Gasull, Armengol@Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Ciencies, Dept Math, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain::Lopez-Salcedo, Jose A.@Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Sch Engn, Dept Telecommun & Syst Engn, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain::Utzet, Frederic@Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Ciencies, Dept Math, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Gasull, Armengol@Autonomous University of Barcelona::Lopez-Salcedo, Jose A.@Autonomous University of Barcelona::Utzet, Frederic@Autonomous University of Barcelona","Gasull, Armengol@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1719-8231","no title+Bruijn de, NG.+ASYMPTOTIC METHODS A+1981::INVERSION OF Y-SUPER-ALPHA-E-SUPER-GAMMA AND Y-LOG-TO-BASE-ALPHA-OF-Y BY MEANS OF STIRLING NUMBERS+COMTET, L+COMPTES RENDUS HEBDOMADAIRES DES SEANCES DE L ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES SERIE A+1970::On the Lambert W function+Corless, RM; Gonnet, GH; Hare, DEG; et al.+ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS+1996::no title+Embrechts, P.; Kluppelberg, C.; Mikosch, T.+Modeling Extremal Events for Insurance and Finance+1997::RATE OF CONVERGENCE OF NORMAL EXTREMES+HALL, P+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1979::On the computer generation of the Erlang and negative binomial distributions with shape parameter equal to two+Jimenez, F.; Jodra, P.+MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION+JAN 2009::no title+Olver, F.

An algorithm for estimating survival under a copula-based dependent truncation model,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0432-8,DEC 2015,33,4,"Traditional analysis with truncated survival data has been developed under the assumption that the lifetime variable of interest is statistically independent of the truncation variable. However, empirical evidence has shown that the truncation variable may depend on the lifetime of interest in many real-world examples. The lack of independence can lead to seriously biased analysis. In this article, we revisit an existing estimation procedure for survival under a copula-based dependent truncation model. Here, the same estimating equation is adopted but a different algorithm to solve the equation is proposed. We compare the new algorithm with the existing one and discuss its theoretical and practical usefulness. Real data examples are analyzed for illustration. We implemented the proposed algorithm in an R ""depend.truncation"" package, available from CRAN.","Archimedean copula,Bivariate survival function,Copula-graphic estimator,Kendall's tau,Left truncation,Product-limit estimator","COMPETING RISKS,ASSUMED COPULA,GRAPHIC ESTIMATOR,INDEPENDENCE,REGRESSION,SELECTION,FAILURE","Emura, T.@Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Stat, Jhongli, Taiwan::Murotani, K.@Nagoya Univ Hosp, Ctr Adv Med & Clin Res, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan","Emura, T.@National Central University::Murotani, K.@Nagoya University",not exist,"Multi-state models for event history analysis+Andersen, PK; Keiding, N+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+APR 2002::Practical methods for competing risks data: A review+Bakoyannis, Giorgos; Touloumi, Giota+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+JUN 2012::Archimedean copula model selection under dependent truncation+Beaudoin, D.; Lakhal-Chaieb, L.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 30 2008::A copula-graphic estimator for the conditional survival function under dependent censoring+Braekers, R; Veraverbeke, N+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+SEP 2005::Estimating survival under a dependent truncation+Chaieb, Lajmi Lakhal; Rivest, Louis-Paul; Abdous, Belkacem+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2006::The product-moment correlation coefficient and linear regression for truncated data+Chen, CH; Tsai, WY; Chao, WH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1996::Semiparametric marginal regression analysis for dependent competing risks under an assumed copula+Chen, Yi-Hau+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2010::no title+de Una-Alvarez, J.+MARKOV 3 STATE PROGR+2012::Copula identifiability conditions for dependent truncated data model+Ding, A.

Partially linear beta regression model with autoregressive errors,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0433-7,DEC 2015,33,1,"This paper is focused on developing a methodology to deal with time series data on the unit interval modeled by a partially linear model with correlated disturbances from a Bayesian perspective. In this context, the linear predictor of the beta regression model incorporates an unknown smooth function with time as an auxiliary covariate and a set of regressors. In addition, an autoregressive dependence structure is proposed for the errors of the model. This formulation can capture the dynamic evolution of curves using both non-stochastic explanatory variables and non-parametric components, allowing an accurate fit with a limited number of parameters. Diagnostic measures are derived from the case-deletion approach and an influence measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence is studied and thus, a new method to determine the optimal order of the autoregressive processes through an adaptive procedure using the conditional predictive ordinate statistic is presented. A simulation study is conducted to assess some properties of the Bayesian estimator. Finally, the proposed methodology is illustrated in two real-life applications.","Autoregressive processes,Bayesian modeling,Beta regression,Partially linear model","US UNEMPLOYMENT,PROPORTIONS,SELECTION,WINBUGS","Ferreira, Guillermo@Univ Concepcion, Dept Stat, Concepcion, Chile::Figueroa-Zuniga, Jorge I.@Univ Concepcion, Dept Stat, Concepcion, Chile::de Castro, Mario@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Ferreira, Guillermo@Universidad de Concepcion::Figueroa-Zuniga, Jorge I.@Universidad de Concepcion::de Castro, Mario@Universidade de Sao Paulo","de Castro, Mario@E-2564-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8685-9470::Inst Cien Matematicas Computacao, ICMC/USP@D-8320-2017::Ferreira, Guillermo@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7233-9885","Generalized autoregressive moving average models+Benjamin, M; Rigby, R; Stasinopoulos, M.+J Am Stat Assoc+2011::Beta autoregressive transition Markov-switching models for business cycle analysis+Billio, M.; Casarin, R.+Stud.

Bootstrap-based model selection criteria for beta regressions,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0434-6,DEC 2015,52,3,"This paper addresses the issue of model selection in the beta regression model focused on small samples. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is a model selection criterion widely used in practical applications. The AIC is an estimator of the expected log-likelihood value, and measures the discrepancy between the true model and the estimated model. In small samples, the AIC is biased and tends to select overparameterized models. To circumvent that problem, we propose two new selection criteria, namely: the bootstrapped likelihood quasi-CV and its 632QCV variant. We use Monte Carlo simulation to compare the finite sample performances of the two proposed criteria to those of the AIC and its variations that use the bootstrapped log-likelihood in the class of varying dispersion beta regressions. The numerical evidence shows that the proposed model selection criteria perform well in small samples. We also present and discuss and empirical application.","AIC,Beta regression,Bootstrap,Cross-validation,Model selection,Varying dispersion","AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION,PREDICTION RULE,ERROR RATE,LIKELIHOOD,PROPORTIONS","Bayer, Fabio M.@Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Estat, BR-97119900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil@Univ Fed Santa Maria, LACESM, BR-97119900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil::Cribari-Neto, Francisco@Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Estat, Recife, PE, Brazil","Bayer, Fabio M.@Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM)::Cribari-Neto, Francisco@Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","Bayer, Fabio@G-4513-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1464-0805","Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike+1998::RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VARIABLE SELECTION AND DATA AUGMENTATION AND A METHOD FOR PREDICTION+ALLEN, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::Model selection criteria in beta regression with varying dispersion+Bayer, Fabio M.; Cribari-Neto, Francisco+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2017::An improved Akaike information criterion for state-space model selection+Bengtsson, T; Cavanaugh, JE+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 20 2006::DONUT SHOPS AND SPEED TRAPS - EVALUATING MODELS OF SUPERVISION ON POLICE BEHAVIOR+BREHM, J; GATES, S+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1993::SUBMODEL SELECTION AND EVALUATION IN REGRESSION - THE X-RANDOM CASE+BREIMAN, L; SPECTOR, P+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1992::Review: regression and time series model selection+Caby, E.+Technometrics+2000::A bootstrap variant of AIC for state-space model selection+Cavanaugh, JE; Shumway, RH+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 1997::Unifying the derivations for the Akaike and corrected Akaike information criteria+Cavanaugh, JE+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+APR 30 1997::Testing inference in variable dispersion beta regressions+Cribari-Neto, F; Souza, T.+J Statist Comput Simul+2012::Cross validation model selection criteria for linear regression based on the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy+Davies, S; Neath, A; Cavanaugh, J.+Stat Methodol+2005::no title+Doornik, J.+Ox 5: object-oriented matrix programming language+2007::1977 RIETZ LECTURE - BOOTSTRAP METHODS - ANOTHER LOOK AT THE JACKKNIFE+EFRON, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::HOW BIASED IS THE APPARENT ERROR RATE OF A PREDICTION RULE+EFRON, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1986::ESTIMATING THE ERROR RATE OF A PREDICTION RULE - IMPROVEMENT ON CROSS-VALIDATION+EFRON, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::Improved likelihood inference in beta regression+Ferrari, Silvia L.

Sharp non-asymptotic performance bounds for and Huber robust regression estimators,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0435-5,DEC 2015,14,1,"A quantitative study of the robustness properties of the and the Huber M-estimator on finite samples is presented. The focus is on the linear model involving a fixed design matrix and additive errors restricted to the dependent variables consisting of noise and sparse outliers. We derive sharp error bounds for the estimator in terms of the leverage constants of a design matrix introduced here.

A change-point problem in relative error-based regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0438-2,DEC 2015,28,3,A nonparametric relative error-based method is proposed to detect and estimate the change point for the multiplicative regression models. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed test statistic for no change-point effect is established. We prove the -consistency of the proposed estimator of the change point. Simulation studies demonstrate that change-point detection and estimation with relative errors perform reasonably well in many practical situations.

Maximum likelihood methods in a robust censored errors-in-variables model,TEST,10.1007/s11749-015-0439-1,DEC 2015,23,4,"We develop a non-standard linear regression analysis by considering that the dependent variable is left censored and also that some of the explanatory variables are measured with additive errors. Our censored measurement error regression model is specified by assuming heavy-tailed distributions for the underlying probabilistic process. Specifically, we focus on assuming a multivariate joint distribution for the error terms and the unobserved true covariates. For the model estimation, we consider the maximum likelihood methodology in which we include the estimation of the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimators. We also develop an EM algorithm to obtain the estimates. The performance of the newly developed methodology is evaluated throughout a simulation study as well as a case study analysis.","Censored regression,Multivariate t distribution,Scale mixtures of normal distributions,Expectation,maximization algorithm","REGRESSION-MODEL,INCOMPLETE DATA","Rocha, Gustavo H.

We consider this problem when the data may contain independent cellwise and casewise outliers. Flat data sets with a large number of variables and a relatively small number of cases are common place in modern statistical applications. In these cases, global down-weighting of an entire case, as performed by traditional robust procedures, may lead to poor results.

Identification of causal effects in linear models: beyond instrumental variables,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0421-3,SEP 2015,30,1,"The instrumental variable (IV) formula has become widely used to address the issue of identification of a causal effect in linear systems with an unobserved variable that acts as direct confounder. We here propose two alternative formulations to achieve identification when the assumptions underlying the use of IV are violated. Parallel to the IV, the proposed formulas exploit the conditional independence structure of a directed acyclic graph and can be obtained via a series of univariate regressions, a feature that renders the results particularly attractive and easy to implement. By exploiting the notion of Markov equivalence, the derivations can also be applied to regression graphs, thereby enlarging the class of models to which the results are of use.","Causal effect,Confounder,Directed acyclic graph,Identification,Latent variable,Regression graph,Structural equation model","GRAPH MODELS,IDENTIFIABILITY,INFERENCE","Stanghellini, Elena@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, I-06100 Perugia, Italy::Pakpahan, Eduwin@European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Florence, Italy","Stanghellini, Elena@University of Perugia::Pakpahan, Eduwin@European University Institute",not exist,"IDENTIFIABILITY OF PARAMETERS IN LATENT STRUCTURE MODELS WITH MANY OBSERVED VARIABLES+Allman, Elizabeth S.; Matias, Catherine; Rhode, John A.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2009::no title+Bollen, K.+Structural Equation with Latent Variables+1989::THEORY OF PARAMETRIC IDENTIFICATION+BOWDEN, R+ECONOMETRICA+1973::no title+Bowden, R.; Darrel, A.+Instrumental Variables+1984::On identifying total effects in the presence of latent variables and selection bias+Cai, Z; Kuroki, M.+P 24 C UNC ART INT U+2012::no title+Coleman, James S; Hoffer, Thomas; Kilgore, Sally.+High School Achievement: Public, Catholic, and Private Schools+1982::no title+Cox, DR; Wermuth, N.+Multivariate dependencies+1996::THE CHAIN GRAPH MARKOV PROPERTY+FRYDENBERG, M+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1990::Pearl's calculus of intervention is complete.+Huang, Y.; Valtorta, M.+P 22 C UNC ART INT+2006::Using descendants as instrumental variables for the identification of directed causal effects in linear SEMs+Kuroki, M; Chan, H.+J Mach Learn Res+2010::Measurement bias and effect restoration in causal inference+Kuroki, Manabu; Pearl, Judea+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2014::Graphical identifiability criteria for causal effects in studies with an unobserved treatment/response variable+Kuroki, Manabu+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2007::no title+Lauritzen, S.

A robust factor analysis model using the restricted skew- distribution,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0422-2,SEP 2015,60,8,"Factor analysis is a classical data-reduction technique that seeks a potentially lower number of unobserved variables that can account for the correlations among the observed variables. This paper presents an extension of the factor analysis model, called the skew- factor analysis model, constructed by assuming a restricted version of the multivariate skew- distribution for the latent factors and a symmetric -distribution for the unobservable errors jointly. The proposed model shows robustness to violations of normality assumptions of the underlying latent factors and provides flexibility in capturing extra skewness as well as heavier tails of the observed data. A computationally feasible expectation conditional maximization algorithm is developed for computing maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters. The usefulness of the proposed methodology is illustrated using both simulated and real data.","ECM algorithm,ML estimation,SNFA model,STFA model,rMSN distribution,rMST distribution","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,T-FACTOR ANALYZERS,INCOMPLETE DATA,ECM ALGORITHM,EM ALGORITHM,MIXTURE,INFORMATION,EXTENSION,FRAMEWORK,INFERENCE","Lin, Tsung-I@China Med Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Taichung 404, Taiwan@Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Inst Stat, Taichung 402, Taiwan::Wu, Pal H.@Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Inst Stat, Taichung 402, Taiwan::McLachlan, Geoffrey J.@Univ Queensland, Dept Math, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia::Lee, Sharon X.@Univ Queensland, Dept Math, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Lin, Tsung-I@China Medical University Taiwan@National Chung Hsing University::Wu, Pal H.@National Chung Hsing University::McLachlan, Geoffrey J.@University of Queensland::Lee, Sharon X.@University of Queensland","McLachlan, Geoffrey@A-1491-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5921-3145::Lin, Tsung-I@Q-3423-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3992-1128","The generalized hyperbolic skew Student's t-distribution+Aas, K.; Haff, I.H.+J.

We obtain recurrent expressions for the density function of delta-records and the probability mass function of inter-delta-record times. In the particular case of the exponential distribution, we show that the sequence of delta-records are distributed as the points of a (delayed) renewal process.

We propose the weighted local linear CQR (WLLCQR) estimators for unknown coefficient function when selection probabilities are known, estimated nonparametrically or parametrically. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the WLLCQR estimators with estimating weights are more efficient than the true weights. Moreover, a goodness-of-fit test based on the WLLCQR fittings is developed to test whether the coefficient functions are actually varying. The finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology is assessed by simulation studies. A real data set is conducted to illustrate our proposed method.","Composite quantile regression,Varying-coefficient model,Missing at random,Inverse probability weighting","COMPOSITE QUANTILE REGRESSION,SMOOTHING SPLINE ESTIMATION,VARIABLE SELECTION,DISTRIBUTIONS","Tang, Linjun@Jiaxing Univ, Dept Stat, Jiaxing 314001, Peoples R China::Zhou, Zhangong@Jiaxing Univ, Dept Stat, Jiaxing 314001, Peoples R China","Tang, Linjun@Jiaxing University::Zhou, Zhangong@Jiaxing University",not exist,"Functional-coefficient regression models for nonlinear time series+Cai, ZW; Fan, JQ; Yao, QW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::Smoothing spline estimation for varying coefficient models with repeatedly measured dependent variables+Chiang, CT; Rice, JA; Wu, CO+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2001::Smoothing spline estimation in varying-coefficient models+Eubank, RL; Huang, CF; Maldonado, YM; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::Statistical estimation in varying coefficient models+Fan, JQ; Zhang, WY+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 1999::Goodness-of-fit tests for general linear models with covariates missed at random+Guo, Xu; Xu, Wangli+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 2012::VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS+HASTIE, T; TIBSHIRANI, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1993::Varying-coefficient models and basis function approximations for the analysis of repeated measurements+Huang, JHZ; Wu, CO; Zhou, L+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2002::Variable selection and coefficient estimation via composite quantile regression with randomly censored data+Jiang, Rong; Qian, Weimin; Zhou, Zhangong+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 2012::NEW EFFICIENT ESTIMATION AND VARIABLE SELECTION METHODS FOR SEMIPARAMETRIC VARYING-COEFFICIENT PARTIALLY LINEAR MODELS+Kai, Bo; Li, Runze; Zou, Hui+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2011::Limiting distributions for L-1 regression estimators under general conditions+Knight, K+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1998::Generalized partially linear models with missing covariates+Liang, Hua+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAY 2008::no title+Little, RJA; Rubin, DB.+Statistical Analysis with Missing Data+2002::Estimation and test procedures for composite quantile regression with covariates missing at random+Ning, Zijun; Tang, Linjun+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+DEC 2014::ESTIMATION OF A PROBABILITY DENSITY-FUNCTION AND MODE+PARZEN, E+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1962::ESTIMATION OF REGRESSION-COEFFICIENTS WHEN SOME REGRESSORS ARE NOT ALWAYS OBSERVED+ROBINS, JM; ROTNITZKY, A; ZHAO, LP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1994::INFERENCE AND MISSING DATA+RUBIN, DB+BIOMETRIKA+1976::An effective bandwidth selector for local least squares regression+Ruppert, D; Sheather, SJ; Wand, MP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Weighted quantile regression for analyzing health care cost data with missing covariates+Sherwood, Ben; Wang, Lan; Zhou, Xiao-Hua+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 10 2013::Weighted local linear composite quantile estimation for the case of general error distributions+Sun, Jing; Gai, Yujie; Lin, Lu+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 2013::New efficient and robust estimation in varying-coefficient models with heteroscedasticity+Tian, MZ; Jie, Guo.+Stat Sin+2012::no title+Tsiatis, A.+Semiparametric Theory and Missing Data+2006::On locally weighted estimation and hypothesis testing of varying-coefficient models with missing covariates+Wong, Heung; Guo, Shaojun; Chen, Min; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1 2009::A two-step smoothing method for varying-coefficient models with repeated measurements+Wu, CO; Yu, KF; Chiang, CT+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 2000::Weighted composite quantile regression estimation and variable selection for varying coefficient models with heteroscedasticity+Yang, H; Lv, J; Guo, CH.+J Korean Stat Soc+2014::Empirical likelihood for a partially linear model with covariate data missing at random+Yang, Yiping; Xue, Liugen; Cheng, Weihu+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 1 2009::Local polynomial fitting in semivarying coefficient models+Zhang, W; Lee, S; Song, X.+J Multivar Anal+2000::Composite quantile regression and the oracle model selection theory+Zou, Hui; Yuan, Ming+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2008"

While most of the usual tools are based on the cumulative distribution functions and of the variables, we focus on the relative density, a function recently used in two-sample problems, and defined as the density of the variable . We provide a nonparametric adaptive strategy to estimate the target function. We first define a collection of estimates using a projection on the trigonometric basis and a preliminary estimator of . An estimator is selected among this collection of projection estimates, with a criterion in the spirit of the Goldenshluger-Lepski methodology. We show the optimality of the procedure both in the oracle and the minimax sense: the convergence rate for the risk computed from an oracle inequality matches with the lower bound that we also derived.

The variance estimator is uniformly oracally efficient, that is, it is as efficient as, up to order less than , the infeasible kernel estimator when the conditional mean function is known, uniformly over the data range. Simulation experiments provide strong evidence that confirms the asymptotic theory while the computing is extremely fast.

On generalized elliptical quantiles in the nonlinear quantile regression setup,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0405-3,JUN 2015,26,1,"Inspired by nonlinear quantile regression, the article introduces, investigates, discusses, and illustrates a new concept of generalized elliptical location quantiles. They may require less stringent moment assumptions, be less sensitive to outliers, be less rigid, employ more a priori information regarding the location of the distribution, and have higher potential for various regression generalizations than their common elliptical predecessor defined in the convex optimization framework by means of standard linear quantile regression. Furthermore, they still include an equivalent of their predecessor as a special case and inherit most of its favorable features such as the probability interpretation, natural equivariance properties, and good behavior for elliptical and symmetric distributions, which is demonstrated both by theoretical results and data examples with convincing graphical output. On the other hand, the new elliptical quantiles need not always be uniquely defined and they require somewhat different approach to their analysis and computation due to their intrinsically non-convex formulation.","Multivariate quantile,Elliptical quantile,Quantile regression,Multivariate statistical inference,Portfolio optimization","HALF-SPACE DEPTH,MULTIVARIATE QUANTILES,L-1 OPTIMIZATION,STATISTICS,INFERENCE,LOCATION,CONTEXT","Hlubinka, Daniel@Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic::Siman, Miroslav@ASCR, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic","Hlubinka, Daniel@Charles University Prague::Siman, Miroslav@Czech Academy of Sciences","Hlubinka, Daniel@C-6385-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4016-3632","Shortfall as a risk measure: properties, optimization and applications+Bertsimas, D; Lauprete, GJ; Samarov, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+APR 2004::ASYMPTOTIC-BEHAVIOR OF S-ESTIMATES OF MULTIVARIATE LOCATION PARAMETERS AND DISPERSION MATRICES+DAVIES, PL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1987::CONDITIONS FOR BIMODALITY AND MULTIMODALITY OF A MIXTURE OF TWO UNIMODAL DENSITIES+Dosla, Sarka+KYBERNETIKA+2009::Local bilinear multiple-output quantile/depth regression+Hallin, M; Lu, Z; Paindaveine, D<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Siman, M</span>.+Bernoulli+2014::MULTIVARIATE QUANTILES AND MULTIPLE-OUTPUT REGRESSION QUANTILES: FROM L-1 OPTIMIZATION TO HALFSPACE DEPTH+Hallin, Marc; Paindaveine, Davy; Siman, Miroslav+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2010::Multivariate quantiles and multiple-output regression quantiles: From L-1 optimization to halfspace depth DISCUSSION+Hallin, Marc; Paindaveine, Davy; Siman, Miroslav+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2010::On elliptical quantiles in the quantile regression setup+Hlubinka, Daniel; Siman, Miroslav+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+APR 2013::no title+Hofert, M.; Kojadinovic, I.; Maechler, M.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Yan, J</span>.+copula: Multivariate Dependence with Copulas.

Doubly censored power-normal regression models with inflation,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0406-2,JUN 2015,25,1,"In this paper we consider power distributions for modeling proportions or rates with zero and/or one inflation as an alternative to beta regression. The considered model is a mixture between a Bernoulli type process for explaining the zero and/or one responses and a limited power-normal model for explaining the continuous responses. We consider extensions by incorporating covariates in both stages of the modeling process. An advantage of the power-normal distribution is its simple distribution function, easy to deal with in censored situations. The likelihood approach is considered for parameter estimation and model comparison. Given the flexibility of the power-normal distribution, we are able to show, in practical scenarios, the better performance of our proposal over the beta regression model with zero and/or one excess (BIZU).","Censoring,Maximum likelihood estimation,Power-normal distribution,Two-part model","LIMITED DEPENDENT-VARIABLES,SKEW-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION,ANTIBODY-RESPONSE,BETA REGRESSION,DISTRIBUTIONS,PROPORTIONS,VACCINE","Martinez-Florez, Guillermo@Univ Cordoba, Dept Math & Stat, Fac Basic Sci, Cordoba, Colombia::Bolfarine, Heleno@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Stat, IME, Sao Paulo, Brazil::Gomez, Hector W.@Univ Antofagasta, Dept Math, Fac Sci, Antofagasta, Chile","Martinez-Florez, Guillermo@Unknow::Bolfarine, Heleno@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Gomez, Hector W.@Universidad de Antofagasta","Gomez, Hector W.@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3726-5507","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::The centred parametrization for the multivariate skew-normal distribution+Arellano-Valle, Reinaldo B.; Azzalini, Adelchi+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2008::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::Bayesian beta regression: Applications to household expenditure data and genetic distance between foot-and-mouth disease viruses+Branscum, Adam J.; Johnson, Wesley O.; Thurmond, Mark C.+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2007::Use of log-skew-normal distribution in analysis of continuous data with a discrete component at zero+Chai, High Seng; Bailey, Kent R.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 15 2008::no title+Cox, DR.+Principles of statistical inference+2006::SOME STATISTICAL MODELS FOR LIMITED DEPENDENT VARIABLES WITH APPLICATION TO DEMAND FOR DURABLE GOODS+CRAGG, JG+ECONOMETRICA+1971::Nearly unbiased maximum likelihood estimation for the beta distribution+Cribari-Neto, F; Vasconcellos, KLP+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+FEB 2002::DISTRIBUTIONS OF FRACTIONAL ORDER-STATISTICS IN HYDROLOGY+DURRANS, SR+WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH+JUN 1992::Beta regression for modelling rates and proportions+Ferrari, SLP; Cribari-Neto, F+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+AUG 2004::Augmented mixed beta regression models for periodontal proportion data+Galvis, Diana M.; Bandyopadhyay, Dipankar; Lachos, Victor H.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 20 2014::Analyzing skewed data by power normal model+Gupta, Rameshwar D.; Gupta, Ramesh C.+TEST+MAY 2008::Regression analysis of variates observed on (0,1): percentages, proportions and fractions+Kieschnick, R; McCullough, BD+STATISTICAL MODELLING+OCT 2003::A grafhical estimation of mixed Weibull parameter in life testing electron tubes+Lehmann, EL.+Technometrics+1953::Asymmetric regression models with limited responses with an application to antibody response to vaccine+Martinez-Florez, Guillermo; Bolfarine, Heleno; Gomez, Hector W.+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+MAR 2013::The Alpha-power Tobit Model+Martinez-Florez, Guillermo; Bolfarine, Heleno; Gomez, Hector W.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+FEB 15 2013::A mixture model with detection limits for regression analyses of antibody response to vaccine+Moulton, LH; Halsey, NA+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1995::A mixed gamma model for regression analyses of quantitative assay data+Moulton, LH; Halsey, NA+VACCINE+AUG 1996::no title+Ospina, R.+Modelo de Regressao Beta Inflacionados.+2008::A general class of zero-or-one inflated beta regression models+Ospina, Raydonal; Ferrari, Silvia L.

Influence diagnostics in elliptical spatial linear models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0409-z,JUN 2015,50,12,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in statistical methods for the analysis of spatially referenced data. The spatial dependence structure modeling is an indispensable tool to estimate the parameters that define this structure. In this paper, we use the family of elliptical distributions to estimate the spatial dependence in referenced data. Thus we extend the Gaussian spatial linear model. Also we use the local influence methodology to assess the sensitivity of the maximum likelihood estimators to small perturbations in the data and/or in the spatial linear model assumptions. The methodology is illustrated with a real data set. The results allowed us to conclude that the presence of atypical values in the sample data have a strong influence, changing the spatial dependence structure. Also we have included a small simulation study.","Elliptical distributions,Geostatistics,Local influence,Maximum likelihood,Spatial variability","LOCAL INFLUENCE,REGRESSION-MODELS,MATRIX,OUTLIERS,DISTRIBUTIONS,EQUATION,LEVERAGE","De Bastiani, Fernanda@Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Estat, Recife, PE, Brazil::Mariz de Aquino Cysneiros, Audrey Helen@Unknow::Uribe-Opazo, Miguel Angel@Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, Ctr Ciencias Exatas & Tecnol, BR-2069 Cascavel, Parana, Brazil::Galea, Manuel@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Estadist, Santiago 4860, Chile","De Bastiani, Fernanda@Universidade Federal de Pernambuco::Mariz de Aquino Cysneiros, Audrey Helen@Unknow::Uribe-Opazo, Miguel Angel@Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana::Galea, Manuel@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile",not exist,"no title+Atkinson, A.; Riani, M.+Exploring multivariate data with the forward search+2004::no title+Barnett, V.+Environmental Statistics: Methods and Applications+2004::Local influence of explanatory variables in Gaussian spatial linear models+Borssoi, Joelmir A.; De Bastiani, Fernanda; Uribe-Opazo, Miguel A.; et al.+CHILEAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2011::ON THE THEORY OF ELLIPTICALLY CONTOURED DISTRIBUTIONS+CAMBANIS, S; HUANG, S; SIMONS, G+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+1981::The ordering of spatial data and the detection of multiple outliers+Cerioli, A; Riani, M+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 1999::PREDICTION DIAGNOSTICS FOR SPATIAL LINEAR-MODELS+CHRISTENSEN, R; JOHNSON, W; PEARSON, LM+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1992::COVARIANCE FUNCTION DIAGNOSTICS FOR SPATIAL LINEAR-MODELS+CHRISTENSEN, R; JOHNSON, W; PEARSON, LM+MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY+FEB 1993::ASSESSMENT OF LOCAL INFLUENCE+COOK, RD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1986::no title+Cressie, N.+Statistics for spatial data+1993::no title+DIAMOND P+MATH GEOL+1984::Model-based Geostatistics+Diggle, PJ; Ribeiro, PJ+MODEL-BASED GEOSTATISTICS+2007::no title+Fang, K; Anderson, T.+Statistical inference in elliptically contoured and related distributions+1990::no title+Fang, K.; Kotz, S.; Ng, K.+Symmetric Multivariate and Related Distributions+1990::no title+Fang, K-T; Zhang, Y-T.+Generalized multivariate analysis.

We then apply the methodology to a working model for the electricity load forecasting on real datasets, where it leads to a substantial improvement of the quality of the predictions.","Informative prior,Hierarchical prior,MCMC algorithms,Short dataset,Electricity load forecasting",WEATHER,"Launay, Tristan@Elect France R&D, F-92141 Clamart, France@Univ Nantes, Lab Math Jean Leray, F-44322 Nantes 3, France::Philippe, Anne@Univ Nantes, Lab Math Jean Leray, F-44322 Nantes 3, France::Lamarche, Sophie@Elect France R&D, F-92141 Clamart, France","Launay, Tristan@Universite de Nantes@Electricite de France (EDF)::Philippe, Anne@Universite de Nantes::Lamarche, Sophie@Electricite de France (EDF)",not exist,"no title+no author+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS F+1965::An Introduction to R+Albert, Jim+BAYESIAN COMPUTATION WITH R, SECOND EDITION+2009::Modelling the impact of temperature on electricity consumption in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia+AlZayer, J; AlIbrahim, AA+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+MAR 1996::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::On the Development of Reference Priors+Bernardo, J.

The exact and near-exact distributions of the main likelihood ratio test statistics used in the complex multivariate normal setting,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0418-y,JUN 2015,32,1,"In this paper the authors show how it is possible to establish a common structure for the exact distribution of the main likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistics used in the complex multivariate normal setting. In contrast to what happens when dealing with real random variables, for complex random variables it is shown that it is possible to obtain closed-form expressions for the exact distributions of the LRT statistics to test independence, equality of mean vectors and the equality of an expected value matrix to a given matrix. For the LRT statistics to test sphericity and the equality of covariance matrices, cases where the exact distribution has a non-manageable expression, easy to implement and very accurate near-exact distributions are developed. Numerical studies show how these near-exact distributions outperform by far any other available approximations. As an example of application of the results obtained, the authors develop a near-exact approximation for the distribution of the LRT statistic to test the equality of several complex normal distributions.","Covariance matrix,Equality of covariance matrices,Equality of mean vectors,Fourier transforms,Generalized integer gamma (GIG) distribution,Generalized near-integer gamma (GNIG) distribution,Independence,Mixtures,Expected value matrix,Sphericity,Statistical distributions (distribution functions)","COVARIANCE MATRICES,GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION,NORMAL POPULATIONS,NORMAL VARIABLES,CRITERION,HYPOTHESES","Coelho, Carlos A.@Univ Nova Lisboa, Dept Matemat, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Ctr Matemat & Aplicacoes CMA FCT UNL, Caparica, Portugal::Arnold, Barry C.@Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Stat, Riverside, CA 92521 USA::Marques, Filipe J.@Univ Nova Lisboa, Dept Matemat, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Ctr Matemat & Aplicacoes CMA FCT UNL, Caparica, Portugal","Coelho, Carlos A.@Universidade Nova de Lisboa::Arnold, Barry C.@University of California System@University of California Riverside::Marques, Filipe J.@Universidade Nova de Lisboa","Coelho, Carlos@A-3078-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5628-0625::Marques, Filipe@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6453-6558","no title+Anderson, T.

A varying-coefficient approach to estimating multi-level clustered data models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0419-x,JUN 2015,19,0,"Most of the literature on clustered data models emphasizes two-level clustering, and within-cluster correlation. While multi-level clustered data models can arise in practice, analysis of multi-level clustered data models poses additional difficulties owing to the existence of error correlations both within and across the clusters. It is perhaps for this reason that existing approaches to multi-level clustered data models have been mostly parametric. The purpose of this paper is to develop a varying-coefficient nonparametric approach to the analysis of three-level clustered data models. Because the nonparametric functions are restricted only to some of the variables, this approach has the appeal of avoiding many of the curse of dimensionality problems commonly associated with other nonparametric methods. By applying an undersmoothing technique, taking into account the correlations within and across clusters, we develop an efficient two-stage local polynomial estimation procedure for the unknown coefficient functions. The large and finite sample properties of the resultant estimators are examined; in particular, we show that the resultant estimators are asymptotically normal, and exhibit considerably smaller asymptotic variability than the traditional local polynomial estimators that neglect the correlations within and among clusters. An application example is presented based on a data set extracted from the World Bank's STARS database.","Asymptotic normality,Correlation,Nonparametric,Clustered data,Two-stage estimation","SEEMINGLY UNRELATED REGRESSIONS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION","You, Jinhong@Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China::Wan, Alan T.

Comparing and selecting spatial predictors using local criteria,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0415-1,MAR 2015,57,10,"Remote sensing technology for the study of Earth and its environment has led to ""Big Data"" that, paradoxically, have global extent but may be spatially sparse. Furthermore, the variability in the measurement error and the latent process error may not fit conveniently into the Gaussian linear paradigm. In this paper, we consider the problem of selecting a predictor from a finite collection of spatial predictors of a spatial random process defined on , a subset of -dimensional Euclidean space. Critically, we make no statistical distributional assumptions other than additive measurement error. In this nonparametric setting, one could use a criterion based on a validation dataset to select a spatial predictor for all of . Instead, we propose local criteria based on validation data to select a predictor at each spatial location in ; the result is a hybrid combination of the spatial predictors, which we call a locally selected predictor (LSP). We consider selection from a collection of some of the classical and more recently proposed spatial predictors currently available. In a simulation study, the relative performances of various LSPs, as well as the performance of each of the individual spatial predictors in the collection, are assessed. ""Big Data"" are always challenging, and here we apply LSP to a very large global spatial dataset of atmospheric measurements.","Information criteria,Model averaging,Model combination,Best linear unbiased predictor","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,CROSS-VALIDATION,ERROR RATE,DATA SETS,RULE","Bradley, Jonathan R.@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::Cressie, Noel@Univ Wollongong, NIASRA, Sch Math & Appl Stat, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia::Shi, Tao@Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Bradley, Jonathan R.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::Cressie, Noel@University of Wollongong::Shi, Tao@Ohio State University",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Asymptotic statistical theory of overtraining and cross-validation+Amari, S; Murata, N; Muller, KR; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS+SEP 1997::no title+Banerjee, Sudipto; Carlin, Bradley P; Gelfand, Alan E.+Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data+2004::Stationary process approximation for the analysis of large spatial datasets+Banerjee, Sudipto; Gelfand, Alan E.; Finley, Andrew O.; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2008::Local Spatial-Predictor Selection+Bradley, J.

Estimating the conditional single-index error distribution with a partial linear mean regression,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0395-1,MAR 2015,32,2,"In this paper, we present a method for estimating the conditional distribution function of the model error. Given the covariates, the conditional mean function is modeled as a partial linear model, and the conditional distribution function of model error is modeled as a single-index model. To estimate the single-index parameter, we propose a semi-parametric global weighted least-squares estimator coupled with an indicator function of the residuals. We derive a residual-based kernel estimator to estimate the unknown conditional distribution function. Asymptotic distributions of the proposed estimators are derived, and the residual-based kernel process constructed by the estimator of the conditional distribution function is shown to converge to a Gaussian process. Simulation studies are conducted and a real dataset is analyzed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed estimators.","Conditional distribution function,Empirical process,Kernel smoothing,Partial linear models,Single-index","VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS,DIMENSION REDUCTION,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD,VARIABLE SELECTION,INDEPENDENCE,DISTORTION","Zhang, Jun@Shenzhen Univ, Shen Zhen Hong Kong Joint Res Ctr Appl Stat Sci, Coll Math & Computat Sci, Inst Stat Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China::Feng, Zhenghui@Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China@Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China::Xu, Peirong@Southeast Univ, Dept Math, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Zhang, Jun@Shenzhen University::Feng, Zhenghui@Xiamen University::Xu, Peirong@Southeast University - China","Zhang, Jun@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4332-5182","Non-parametric estimation of the residual distribution+Akritas, MG; Van Keilegom, I+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2001::Generalized partially linear single-index models+Carroll, RJ; Fan, JQ; Gijbels, I; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1997::CONVERGENCE-RATES FOR PARAMETRIC COMPONENTS IN A PARTLY LINEAR-MODEL+CHEN, H+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1988::Tests for independence in nonparametric regression+Einmahl, John H.

Handling non-ignorable dropouts in longitudinal data: a conditional model based on a latent Markov heterogeneity structure,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0397-z,MAR 2015,40,5,"We illustrate a class of conditional models for the analysis of longitudinal data suffering attrition in random effects models framework, where the subject-specific random effects are assumed to be discrete and to follow a time-dependent latent process. The latent process accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and correlation between individuals in a dynamic fashion, and for dependence between the observed process and the missing data mechanism. Of particular interest is the case where the missing mechanism is non-ignorable. To deal with the topic we introduce a conditional to dropout model. A shape change in the random effects distribution is considered by directly modeling the effect of the missing data process on the evolution of the latent structure. To estimate the resulting model, we rely on the conditional maximum likelihood approach and for this aim we outline an EM algorithm. The proposal is illustrated via simulations and then applied on a dataset concerning skin cancers. Comparisons with other well-established methods are provided as well.","Hidden Markov chains,Conditional maximum likelihood,Non-ignorable missingness,Longitudinal data,Skin cancer","MIXTURE LIKELIHOODS,MISSING DATA,SELECTION,SKIN,MAXIMIZATION,ATTRITION,RESPONSES,GEOMETRY,CANCERS","Maruotti, Antonello@Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci Polit, Rome, Italy@Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst, Southampton, Hants, England","Maruotti, Antonello@University of Southampton@Roma Tre University","MARUOTTI, Antonello@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8377-9950","no title+AKAIKE H+SECOND INTERNATIONAL+1973::Random effects and latent process approaches for analyzing binary longitudinal data with missingness: a comparison of approaches using opiate clinical trial data+Albert, PS; Follman, DA.+Stat Methods Med Res+2007::Random coefficient models for binary longitudinal responses with attrition+Alfo, M; Aitkin, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+OCT 2000::A selection model for longitudinal binary responses subject to non-ignorable attrition+Alfo, Marco; Maruotti, Antonello+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+AUG 30 2009::A comparison of some criteria for states selection in the latent Markov model for longitudinal data+Bacci, S.; Pandolfi, S.; Pennoni, F.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+JUN 2014::no title+Bartolucci, F; Farcomeni, A; Pennoni, F.+LatentMarkov model for longitudinal data+2012::LATENT MARKOV MODEL FOR LONGITUDINAL BINARY DATA: AN APPLICATION TO THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF NURSING HOMES+Bartolucci, Francesco; Lupparelli, Monia; Montanari, Giorgio E.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JUN 2009::A Multivariate Extension of the Dynamic Logit Model for Longitudinal Data Based on a Latent Markov Heterogeneity Structure+Bartolucci, Francesco; Farcomeni, Alessio+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2009::A MAXIMIZATION TECHNIQUE OCCURRING IN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS OF MARKOV CHAINS+BAUM, LE; PETRIE, T; SOULES, G; et al.+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1970::A correlated random effects model for longitudinal data with non-ignorable drop-out: An application to university student performance+Belloc, F.; Maruotti, A.; Petrella, L.+Advanced Statistical Methods for the Analysis of Large Data-Sets+2012::A latent-class mixture model for incomplete longitudinal Gaussian data+Beunckens, Caroline; Molenberghs, Geert; Verbeke, Geert; et al.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2008::no title+Bozdogan, H.+Proceedings of the first US/Japan conference on the frontiers of statistical modeling: an informational approach+1994::Computational issues in parameter estimation for stationary hidden Markov models+Bulla, Jan; Berzel, Andreas+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+JAN 2008::Maximum likelihood estimation in discrete mixed hidden Markov models using the SAEM algorithm+Delattre, M.; Lavielle, M.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 2012::Analysis of longitudinal data with drop-out: objectives, assumptions and a proposal+Diggle, Peter; Farewell, Daniel; Henderson, Robin+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2007::Methods for handling dropouts in longitudinal clinical trials+Fitzmaurice, GM+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+FEB 2003::Occupational skin cancers+Gawkrodger, DJ+OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-OXFORD+OCT 2004::The risk and risk factors of a second non-melanoma skin cancer: a study in a Mediterranean population+Graells, J+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY+MAR 2004::A CLINICAL-TRIAL OF BETA-CAROTENE TO PREVENT BASAL-CELL AND SQUAMOUS-CELL CANCERS OF THE SKIN+GREENBERG, ER; BARON, JA; STUKEL, TA; et al.+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+SEP 20 1990::Pattern-Mixture Zero-Inflated Mixed Models for Longitudinal Unbalanced Count Data with Excessive Zeros+Hasan, M.

A semiparametric approach for joint modeling of median and skewness,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0401-7,MAR 2015,33,8,"We motivate this paper by showing through Monte Carlo simulation that ignoring the skewness of the response variable distribution in non-linear regression models may introduce biases on the parameter estimates and/or on the estimation of the associated variability measures. Then, we propose a semiparametric regression model suitable for data set analysis in which the distribution of the response is strictly positive and asymmetric. In this setup, both median and skewness of the response variable distribution are explicitly modeled, the median using a parametric non-linear function and the skewness using a semiparametric function. The proposed model allows for the description of the response using the log-symmetric distribution, which is a generalization of the log-normal distribution and is flexible enough to consider bimodal distributions in special cases as well as distributions having heavier or lighter tails than those of the log-normal one. An iterative estimation process as well as some diagnostic methods are derived. Two data sets previously analyzed under parametric models are reanalyzed using the proposed methodology.","Skewness,Asymmetric responses,Maximum penalized likelihood estimates,Semiparametric models,Robust estimates,Natural cubic spline","BIRNBAUM-SAUNDERS DISTRIBUTION,SYMMETRICAL NONLINEAR MODELS,NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS,REGRESSION-MODELS,SCALE MIXTURES,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,ADDITIVE-MODELS,LOCAL INFLUENCE,T DISTRIBUTION,DIAGNOSTICS","Hernando Vanegas, Luis@Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Estadist, Bogota, Colombia@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Matemat & Estat, Sao Paulo, Brazil::Paula, Gilberto A.@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Matemat & Estat, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Hernando Vanegas, Luis@Universidad Nacional de Colombia@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Paula, Gilberto A.@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Paula, Gilberto@D-2924-2012","Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike+1998::SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::A NEW FAMILY OF LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS+BIRNBAUM, ZW; SAUNDERS, SC+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1969::no title+Conover, W.J.+Practical Nonparametric Statistics+1971::ASSESSMENT OF LOCAL INFLUENCE+COOK, RD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1986::Corrected maximum likelihood estimators in heteroscedastic symmetric nonlinear models+Cysneiros, F.

Complete convergence for weighted sums of NSD random variables and its application in the EV regression model,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0402-6,MAR 2015,36,20,"In this paper, some basic properties for negatively superadditive-dependent (NSD, in short) random variables are presented, such as the Rosenthal-type inequality and the Kolmogorov-type exponential inequality. Using these properties, we further study the complete convergence for weighted sums of NSD random variables, which generalizes and improves some corresponding ones for independent random variables and negatively associated random variables. Some sufficient conditions to prove the complete convergence for weighted sums of NSD random variables are provided. As an application, the complete consistency of LS estimators in the EV regression model with NSD errors is investigated under mild conditions, which generalizes and improves the corresponding one for negatively associated random variables.","Negatively superadditive-dependent random variables,Complete convergence,Complete consistency,EV regression model,Rosenthal-type inequality,Kolmogorov-type exponential inequality","DEPENDENT RANDOM-VARIABLES,LS ESTIMATOR,ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES,SURE CONVERGENCE,QUADRATIC-FORMS,INEQUALITIES,ASSOCIATION,THEOREM,ERRORS","Wang, Xuejun@Anhui Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China::Shen, Aiting@Anhui Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China::Chen, Zhiyong@Anhui Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China::Hu, Shuhe@Anhui Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China","Wang, Xuejun@Anhui University::Shen, Aiting@Anhui University::Chen, Zhiyong@Anhui University::Hu, Shuhe@Anhui University",not exist,"CONVERGENCE RATES IN LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS+BAUM, LE; KATZ, M+TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY+1965::A connection between supermodular ordering and positive/negative association+Christofides, TC; Vaggelatou, E+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2004::On the Kolmogorov inequalities for quadratic forms of dependent uniformly bounded random variables+Eghbal, N.; Amini, M.; Bozorgnia, A.+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+AUG 2011::Some maximal inequalities for quadratic forms of negative superadditive dependence random variables+Eghbal, N.; Amini, M.; Bozorgnia, A.+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+APR 1 2010::ON A THEOREM OF HSU AND ROBBINS+ERDOS, P+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1949::Asymptotic properties for LS estimators in EV regression model with dependent errors+Fan, Guo-Liang; Liang, Han-Ying; Wang, Jiang-Feng; et al.+ASTA-ADVANCES IN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS+MAR 2010::Asymptotic properties of an estimator in nonlinear functional errors-in-variables models with dependent error terms+Fazekas, I; Kukush, AG+COMPUTERS &amp; MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS+NOV 1997::no title+Fuller, W.

Robust comparison of regression curves,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0394-2,MAR 2015,29,3,"This paper is concerned about robust comparison of two regression curves. Most of the procedures in the literature are least-squares-based methods with local polynomial approximation to nonparametric regression. However, the efficiency of these methods is adversely affected by outlying observations and heavy-tailed distributions. To attack this challenge, a robust testing procedure is recommended under the framework of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLR) by incorporating with a Wilcoxon-type artificial likelihood function. Under the null hypothesis, the proposed test statistic is proved to be asymptotically normal and free of nuisance parameters and covariate designs. Its asymptotic relative efficiency with respect to the least-squares-based GLR method is closely related to that of the signed-rank Wilcoxon test in comparison with the test. We then consider a bootstrap approximation to determine values of the test in finite sample situation. Its asymptotic validity is also presented. A simulation study is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed test and to compare it with its competitors in the literature.","Bootstrap,Generalized likelihood ratio,Lack-of-fit test,Local polynomial regression,Local Walsh-average regression","WALSH-AVERAGE REGRESSION,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,TESTS,DIFFERENCE,EQUALITY,MODELS","Feng, Long@Nankai Univ, Inst Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Zou, Changliang@Nankai Univ, Inst Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Wang, Zhaojun@Nankai Univ, Inst Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Zhu, Lixing@Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Feng, Long@Nankai University::Zou, Changliang@Nankai University::Wang, Zhaojun@Nankai University::Zhu, Lixing@Hong Kong Baptist University","HKBU, Mathematics@B-5086-2009::Zhu, Lixing@B-7199-2009::Feng, Long@D-5094-2013::Zhu, Lixing@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1611-4267","TESTING THE EQUALITY OF NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION-CURVES+DELGADO, MA+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 18 1993::Nonparametric analysis of covariance+Dette, H; Neumeyer, N+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2001::Testing heteroscedasticity in nonparametric regression+Dette, H; Munk, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::Generalized likelihood ratio statistics and Wilks phenomenon+Fan, JQ; Zhang, CM; Zhang, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2001::LOCAL LINEAR-REGRESSION SMOOTHERS AND THEIR MINIMAX EFFICIENCIES+FAN, JQ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1993::Local Walsh-average regression+Feng, Long; Zou, Changliang; Wang, Zhaojun+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+APR 2012::Data-driven rate-optimal specification testing in regression models+Gueerre, E; Lavergne, P.+Ann Stat+2005::Covariate-matched one-sided tests for the difference between functional means+Hall, P; Huber, C; Speckman, PL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::BOOTSTRAP TEST FOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEANS IN NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION+HALL, P; HART, JD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1990::COMPARING NONPARAMETRIC VERSUS PARAMETRIC REGRESSION FITS+HARDLE, W; MAMMEN, E+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1993::no title+Hart, J.

We compare cross-sectional and time series benchmarking empirically, using data generated from a time series model which complies with the familiar Fay-Herriot model at any given time point. In the second part, we review cross-sectional methods proposed for benchmarking hierarchical small areas and develop a new two-stage benchmarking procedure for hierarchical time series models.

They develop a novel two-stage benchmarking method for hierarchical time series models, where they evaluate their procedure by estimating monthly total unemployment using data from the US Census Bureau. We discuss three topics: linearity and model misspecification, computational complexity and model comparisons, and, some aspects on small area estimation in practice. More specifically, we pose the following questions to the authors, that they may wish to answer: How robust is their model to misspecification? Is it time to perhaps move away from linear models of the type considered by Fay and Herriot (J Am Stat Assoc 74:269-277, 1979), Battese et al. (J Am Stat Assoc 83:28-36, 1988)? What is the asymptotic computational complexity and what comparisons can be made to other models? Should the benchmarking constraints be inherently fixed or should they be random?.",,,"Steorts, Rebecca C.@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA::Ugarte, M.

Two new methods for non-inferiority testing of the ratio in matched-pair setting,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0374-6,DEC 2014,11,2,"Non-inferiority of one treatment to another based on ratio is a common issue in medical research. Nam and Blackwelder derived a Fieller-type statistic from constrained maximum likelihood estimation of nuisance parameters. Although it improved that of Lachenbruch and Lynch, its size still exceeds the claimed nominal level alpha for some cases. This is in accordance with Sidik who has found that the asymptotic tests are inaccurate in testing a hypothesis of a non-zero difference between marginal probabilities. In this paper, we extend Sidik's exact tests to non-inferiority in ratio, and propose two new methods-one based on the standard value and the other from restricted Bayesian estimation using an approximate value. Our tests are both based on only one point of the two-dimension nuisance parameter space for accuracy improvement and computational purposes. The sizes and powers of our tests are considered. Simulation results suggest that our tests can control the type I error rates well with competitive powers while the Fieller-type statistic cannot for some cases be investigated.","Matched-pairs sample,Non-inferiority testing,Bayesian estimation,Approximate p value","MCNEMARS TEST,SAMPLE-SIZE,EQUIVALENCE,DESIGN,PROPORTIONS","Jin, Hua@S China Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China::Feng, Xiaobo@S China Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China::Chen, Mingming@S China Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China::Zhang, Chenling@Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Business Sch, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Jin, Hua@South China Normal University::Feng, Xiaobo@South China Normal University::Chen, Mingming@South China Normal University::Zhang, Chenling@Sun Yat Sen University",not exist,"APPROXIMATE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS .2.

Efficiency combined with simplicity: new testing procedures for Generalized Inverse Gaussian models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0378-2,DEC 2014,24,1,"The standard efficient testing procedures in the Generalized Inverse Gaussian (GIG) family (also known as Halphen Type A family) are likelihood ratio tests, and hence rely on Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation of the three parameters of the GIG. The particular form of GIG densities, involving modified Bessel functions, prevents in general form a closed-form expression for ML estimators, which are obtained at the expense of complex numerical approximation methods. On the contrary, Method of Moments (MM) estimators allow for concise expressions, but tests based on these estimators suffer from a lack of efficiency as compared to likelihood ratio tests. This is why, in recent years, trade-offs between ML and MM estimators have been proposed, resulting in simpler yet not completely efficient estimators and tests. In the present paper, we do not propose such a trade-off but rather an optimal combination of both methods, our tests inheriting efficiency from an ML-like construction and simplicity from the MM estimators of the nuisance parameters. This goal shall be reached by attacking the problem from a new angle, namely via the Le Cam methodology. Besides providing simple efficient testing methods, the theoretical background of this methodology further allows us to write out explicitly power expressions for our tests. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that, also at small sample sizes, our simpler procedures do at least as good as the complex likelihood ratio tests. We conclude the paper by applying our findings on two real-data sets.","Asymptotic linearity,GIG distributions,IG distributions,Maximin tests,Uniform local asymptotic normality","STATISTICAL PROPERTIES,DISTRIBUTIONS","Koudou, Angelo Efoevi@Univ Lorraine, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France@CNRS, Inst Elie Cartan Lorraine, UMR 7502, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France::Ley, Christophe@Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium@Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Math, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Koudou, Angelo Efoevi@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Universite de Lorraine@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Ley, Christophe@Universite Libre de Bruxelles",not exist,"INFINITE DIVISIBILITY OF HYPERBOLIC AND GENERALIZED INVERSE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O; HALGREEN, C+ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WAHRSCHEINLICHKEITSTHEORIE UND VERWANDTE GEBIETE+1977::no title+Bickel, P.

Spatial depth-based classification for functional data,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0379-1,DEC 2014,31,13,"We enlarge the number of available functional depths by introducing the kernelized functional spatial depth (KFSD). KFSD is a local-oriented and kernel-based version of the recently proposed functional spatial depth (FSD) that may be useful for studying functional samples that require an analysis at a local level. In addition, we consider supervised functional classification problems, focusing on cases in which the differences between groups are not extremely clear-cut or the data may contain outlying curves. We perform classification by means of some available robust methods that involve the use of a given functional depth, including FSD and KFSD, among others. We use the functional k-nearest neighbor classifier as a benchmark procedure. The results of a simulation study indicate that the KFSD-based classification approach leads to good results. Finally, we consider two real classification problems, obtaining results that are consistent with the findings observed with simulated curves.","Functional depths,Functional outliers,Functional spatial depth,Kernelized functional spatial depth,Supervised functional classification","DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,CURVES,REGRESSION,NOTIONS,SPACES","Sguera, Carlo@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, E-28903 Getafe, Madrid, Spain::Galeano, Pedro@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, E-28903 Getafe, Madrid, Spain::Lillo, Rosa@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, E-28903 Getafe, Madrid, Spain","Sguera, Carlo@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Galeano, Pedro@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Lillo, Rosa@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","Galeano, Pedro@H-2186-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2577-2747","Local depth+Agostinelli, Claudio; Romanazzi, Mario+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 2011::STATISTICAL USES OF THE SPATIAL MEDIAN+BROWN, BM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1983::k-Nearest Neighbour method in functional nonparametric regression+Burba, Florent; Ferraty, Frederic; Vieu, Philippe+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+2009::Efficient and fast estimation of the geometric median in Hilbert spaces with an averaged stochastic gradient algorithm+Cardot, Herve; Cenac, Peggy; Zitt, Pierre-Andre+BERNOULLI+FEB 2013::Nearest neighbor classification in infinite dimension+Cerou, F; Guyader, A.+ESAIM Probab Stat+2006::On data depth in infinite dimensional spaces+Chakraborty, Anirvan; Chaudhuri, Probal+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+APR 2014::On a geometric notion of quantiles for multivariate data+Chaudhuri, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::The random Tukey depth+Cuesta-Albertos, J.

Calibration tests for count data,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0380-8,DEC 2014,39,6,"Calibration, the statistical consistency of forecast distributions and observations, is a central requirement for probabilistic predictions. Calibration of continuous forecasts has been widely discussed, and significance tests are commonly used to detect whether a prediction model is miscalibrated. However, calibration tests for discrete forecasts are rare, especially for distributions with unlimited support. In this paper, we propose two types of calibration tests for count data: tests based on conditional exceedance probabilities and tests based on proper scoring rules. For the latter, three scoring rules are considered: the ranked probability score, the logarithmic score and the Dawid-Sebastiani score. Simulation studies show that all the different tests have good control of the type I error rate and sufficient power under miscalibration. As an illustration, we apply the methodology to weekly data on meningoccocal disease incidence in Germany, 2001-2006. The results show that the test approach is powerful in detecting miscalibrated forecasts.","Calibration test,Count data,Predictive distribution,Proper scoring rules","DISEASE SURVEILLANCE DATA,TIME-SERIES MODELS,INFECTIOUS-DISEASE,PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS,PREDICTIONS,MANAGEMENT,REGRESSION,FRAMEWORK,ALGORITHM,OUTBREAKS","Wei, Wei@Univ Zurich, Div Biostat, Inst Social & Prevent Med, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland::Held, Leonhard@Univ Zurich, Div Biostat, Inst Social & Prevent Med, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland","Wei, Wei@University of Zurich::Held, Leonhard@University of Zurich","Held, Leonhard@E-8159-2010","Verification of forecasts expressed in terms of probabilities+Brier, GW.+Monthly Weather Rev+1950::Evaluating interval forecasts+Christoffersen, PF+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 1998::Predictive density and conditional confidence interval accuracy tests+Corradi, Valentina; Swanson, Norman R.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV-DEC 2006::2 FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF A MODEL FOR BINARY REGRESSION+COX, DR+BIOMETRIKA+1958::Predictive Model Assessment for Count Data+Czado, Claudia; Gneiting, Tilmann; Held, Leonhard+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2009::Coherent dispersion criteria for optimal experimental design+Dawid, AP; Sebastiani, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 1999::STATISTICAL-THEORY - THE PREQUENTIAL APPROACH+DAWID, AP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1984::no title+DeGroot, M.; Schervish, M.+Probability and Statistics+2012::Evaluating density forecasts with applications to financial risk management+Diebold, FX; Gunther, TA; Tay, AS+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 1998::COMPARING PREDICTIVE ACCURACY+DIEBOLD, FX; MARIANO, RS+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1995::Prediction models for annual US hurricane counts+Elsner, James B.; Jagger, Thomas H.+JOURNAL OF CLIMATE+JUN 15 2006::A scoring system for probability forecasts of ranked categories+Epstein, E.+J.

A simultaneous confidence corridor for varying coefficient regression with sparse functional data,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0392-4,DEC 2014,38,7,"We consider a varying coefficient regression model for sparse functional data, with time varying response variable depending linearly on some time-independent covariates with coefficients as functions of time-dependent covariates. Based on spline smoothing, we propose data-driven simultaneous confidence corridors for the coefficient functions with asymptotically correct confidence level. Such confidence corridors are useful benchmarks for statistical inference on the global shapes of coefficient functions under any hypotheses. Simulation experiments corroborate with the theoretical results. An example in CD4/HIV study is used to illustrate how inference is made with computable p values on the effects of smoking, pre-infection CD4 cell percentage and age on the CD4 cell percentage of HIV infected patients under treatment.","B spline,Confidence corridor,Karhunen-Loeve L-2 representation,Knots,Functional data,Varying coefficient","LONGITUDINAL DATA,LINEAR-REGRESSION,POLYNOMIAL SPLINE,MODELS,BANDS,DERIVATIVES,CURVES","Gu, Lijie@Soochow Univ, Ctr Adv Stat & Econometr Res, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China::Wang, Li@Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA::Haerdle, Wolfgang K.@Singapore Management Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Business, Singapore 178902, Singapore@Humboldt Univ, CASE, Berlin, Germany::Yang, Lijian@Soochow Univ, Ctr Adv Stat & Econometr Res, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China","Gu, Lijie@Suzhou University::Wang, Li@Iowa State University::Haerdle, Wolfgang K.@Singapore Management University@Humboldt University of Berlin::Yang, Lijian@Suzhou University","Yang, Lijian@E-1848-2011","no title+Bosq, D.+Nonparametric Statistics for Stochastic Processes: Estimation and Prediction+1998::Smoothing spline models for the analysis of nested and crossed samples of curves+Brumback, BA; Rice, JA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1998::Simultaneous inference for the mean function based on dense functional data+Cao, Guanqun; Yang, Lijian; Todem, David+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+2012::Spline confidence bands for functional derivatives+Cao, Guanqun; Wang, Jing; Wang, Li; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 2012::Smoothing spline estimation for varying coefficient models with repeatedly measured dependent variables+Chiang, CT; Rice, JA; Wu, CO+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2001::Bootstrap confidence bands for regression curves and their derivatives+Claeskens, G; Van Keilegom, I+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2003::no title+De Boor, C.+A practical guide to splines+2001::Statistical methods with varying coefficient models+Fan, Jianqing; Zhang, Wenyang+STATISTICS AND ITS INTERFACE+2008::Two-step estimation of functional linear models with applications to longitudinal data+Fan, JQ; Zhang, JT+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::Simultaneous confidence bands and hypothesis testing in varying-coefficient models+Fan, JQ; Zhang, WY+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2000::no title+Ferraty, F.; Vieu, P.+Nonparametric functional data analysis.

Latent Markov models: a review of a general framework for the analysis of longitudinal data with covariates,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0381-7,SEP 2014,99,11,"We provide a comprehensive overview of latent Markov (LM) models for the analysis of longitudinal categorical data. We illustrate the general version of the LM model which includes individual covariates, and several constrained versions. Constraints make the model more parsimonious and allow us to consider and test hypotheses of interest. These constraints may be put on the conditional distribution of the response variables given the latent process (measurement model) or on the distribution of the latent process (latent model). We also illustrate in detail maximum likelihood estimation through the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which may be efficiently implemented by recursions taken from the hidden Markov literature. We outline methods for obtaining standard errors for the parameter estimates. We also illustrate methods for selecting the number of states and for path prediction. Finally, we mention issues related to Bayesian inference of LM models. Possibilities for further developments are given among the concluding remarks.","EM algorithm,Bayesian framework,Forward-Backward recursions,Hidden Markov models,Measurement errors,Panel data,Unobserved heterogeneity","OBSERVED INFORMATION MATRIX,FINITE MIXTURE-MODELS,PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,SPEECH RECOGNITION,EM ALGORITHM,CHAINS,PERFORMANCE,INFERENCE,HETEROGENEITY","Bartolucci, F.@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, I-06100 Perugia, Italy::Farcomeni, A.@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Hlth & Infect Dis, I-00185 Rome, Italy::Pennoni, F.@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy","Bartolucci, F.@University of Perugia::Farcomeni, A.@Sapienza University Rome::Pennoni, F.@University of Milano-Bicocca","Bartolucci, Francesco@J-7877-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7057-1421::Farcomeni, Alessio@K-8719-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7104-5826","Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::Mixed hidden Markov models: An extension of the hidden Markov model to the longitudinal data setting+Altman, Rachel MacKay+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2007::Probability models for analysing time changes in attitudes+Anderson, TW.+Mathematical thinking in the social science+1954::Probability models for analysing time changes in attitudes+Anderson, TW.+The use of mathematical models in the measurement of the attitudes+1951::SUBSPACE ESTIMATION AND PREDICTION METHODS FOR HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS+Andersson, Sofia; Ryden, Tobias+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2009::Parameter estimation for hidden Markov chains+Archer, GEB; Titterington, DM+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 1 2002::A comparison of some criteria for states selection in the latent Markov model for longitudinal data+Bacci, S.; Pandolfi, S.; Pennoni, F.+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+JUN 2014::A new constant memory recursion for hidden Markov models+Bartolucci, F; Pandolfi, S.+J Comput Biol+2013::A latent Markov model for detecting patterns of criminal activity+Bartolucci, F; Pennoni, F; Francis, B.+J R Stat Soc Ser A+2007::Likelihood inference for a class of latent Markov models under linear hypotheses on the transition probabilities+Bartolucci, F+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::no title+Bartolucci, F.; Farcomeni, A.; Pennoni, F.+Latent Markov Models for Longitudinal Data+2013::LATENT MARKOV MODEL FOR LONGITUDINAL BINARY DATA: AN APPLICATION TO THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF NURSING HOMES+Bartolucci, Francesco; Lupparelli, Monia; Montanari, Giorgio E.+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JUN 2009::A class of latent Markov models for capture-recapture data allowing for time, heterogeneity, and behavior effects+Bartolucci, Francesco; Pennoni, Fulvia+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2007::Assessment of School Performance Through a Multilevel Latent Markov Rasch Model+Bartolucci, Francesco; Pennoni, Fulvia; Vittadini, Giorgio+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+AUG 2011::A Multivariate Extension of the Dynamic Logit Model for Longitudinal Data Based on a Latent Markov Heterogeneity Structure+Bartolucci, Francesco; Farcomeni, Alessio+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2009::A note on the mixture transition distribution and hidden Markov models+Bartolucci, Francesco; Farcomeni, Alessio+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAR 2010::A MAXIMIZATION TECHNIQUE OCCURRING IN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS OF MARKOV CHAINS+BAUM, LE; PETRIE, T; SOULES, G; et al.+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1970::STATISTICAL INFERENCE FOR PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS OF FINITE STATE MARKOV CHAINS+BAUM, LE; PETRIE, T+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1966::Optimization of mixture models: Comparison of different strategies+Berchtold, A+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2004::no title+Bernardo, J.

(Test, 2014) provide a nice showcase of the flexibility of latent Markov models for longitudinal data. Indeed, their list of applications is impressive and includes a wide variety of models, with covariates to model transitions between latent states and direct effects on the observations, such that the model becomes a latent Markov regression model, and models for multivariate data, to mention but a few. Bartolucci et al. also briefly discuss the relationship between latent Markov models and hidden Markov models. These models share their basic assumptions, but were developed with different objectives in mind: the latent Markov model is aimed at longitudinal data, whereas the hidden Markov model is aimed at modeling time-series data. As a result of this difference in focus, different estimation and inference methods have been developed, which each have their strengths and weaknesses. Surprisingly, the literatures on latent and hidden Markov models have remained largely separate. We believe that a marriage between these literatures can provide even greater flexibility to this modeling framework than each of them can muster separately.","Hidden Markov model,Contingency table,Missing data,Continuous time observations,Psychology,Software","TIME-SERIES,TRANSITION","Visser, Ingmar@Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Brain & Cognit, Amsterdam, Netherlands::Speekenbrink, Maarten@UCL, London, England","Visser, Ingmar@University of Amsterdam::Speekenbrink, Maarten@University of London@University College London","Speekenbrink, Maarten@C-1904-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3221-1091::Visser, Ingmar@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3855-2778","Latent Markov models: a review of a general framework for the analysis longitudinal data with covariates+Bartolucci, F; Farcomeni, A; Pennoni, F.+TEST+2014::no title+Bartolucci, F.+University of Perugia, and LMest: fit latent Markov models in basic versions, 2012+2012::STATISTICAL INFERENCE FOR PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS OF FINITE STATE MARKOV CHAINS+BAUM, LE; PETRIE, T+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1966::no title+Beketov, MA.+HMMCont: hidden Markov model for continuous observations processes, 2014+2014::Stylized facts of financial time series and hidden semi-Markov models+Bulla, Jan; Bulla, Ingo+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 15 2006::A brain-based account of the development of rule use in childhood+Bunge, SA; Zelazo, PD+CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE+JUN 2006::On certain formal properties of grammars+Chomsky, N.+Inf.

The p value line: a way to choose the tuning constant in tests based on the Huber -estimator,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0361-y,SEP 2014,19,1,"In this paper, we propose a method to choose a test result from several competing ones. The choice is based on the p value under the alternative, i.e., the probability of obtaining an extreme or a more extreme result than the one actually observed, assuming that the alternative hypothesis is true. The function obtained, by moving the alternative, is called the p value line. Because this combines the power of a test and its sensitivity to outliers, it is considered to be the basis for the selection between several classical and/or robust test results. When we change the trimming fraction in the trimmed mean, or the tuning constant when we consider a test based on the Huber -estimator, we obtain competing robust test results. For this reason, we can use the p value line to choose the trimming fraction or the tuning constant in an objective way. In this article, we shall focus on the second class of estimators. Because computing the distribution of the test statistic under the alternative could be a very hard problem, a linear approximation of the tail probability functional based on the von Mises expansion can be used to compute the p value line. Applications of the proposal to the one-sample location problem, generalized linear models and generalized additive models are considered in the article. We conclude the article with the random p value line to decide if the observed differences between p value lines are significant or not.","p value,Robustness in hypothesis testing,Huber M-estimator,Von Mises expansion,Tuning constant","SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL,MODELS","Garcia-Perez, A.@UNED, IOyCN, Dept Estadist, Madrid 28040, Spain","Garcia-Perez, A.@Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED)",not exist,"An Outlier-Robust Fit for Generalized Additive Models With Applications to Disease Outbreak Detection+Alimadad, Azadeh; Salibian-Barrera, Matias+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2011::STOCHASTIC COMPARISON OF TESTS+BAHADUR, RR+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1960::Median of the p value under the alternative hypothesis+Bhattacharya, B; Habtzghi, D+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 2002::Robust inference for generalized linear models+Cantoni, E; Ronchetti, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::no title+Dehon, C; Gassner, M; Verardi, V.+Extending the Hausman test to check for the presence of outliers+2011::Test for outlier detection and optimal choice of efficiency for MM-regression estimators+Dehon, C; Gassner, M; Verardi, V.+P 3 INT C ERCIM WORK+2010::A Hausman-type test to detect the presence of influential outliers in regression analysis+Dehon, Catherine; Gassner, Marjorie; Verardi, Vincenzo+ECONOMICS LETTERS+OCT 2009::EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL AS A SENSITIVITY INDEX FOR TEST STATISTICS+DEMPSTER, AP; SCHATZOFF, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1965::A tail area influence function and its application to testing+Field, CA; Ronchetti, EM.+Commun Stat+1985::A linear approximation to the power function of a test+Garcia-Perez, A.+METRIKA+OCT 2012::Another look at the Tail Area Influence Function+Garcia-Perez, A.+METRIKA+JAN 2011::no title+GARCIAPEREZ A+SYNERGIES SOFT COMPU+2013::MEDIAN SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL AND OTHER SMALL SAMPLE MEASURES OF TEST EFFICACY+JOINER, BL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::ASYMPTOTIC LOG-NORMALITY OF P-VALUES+LAMBERT, D; HALL, WJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::no title+Maronna, R.

Bayesian model robustness via disparities,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0360-z,SEP 2014,41,6,"This paper develops a methodology for robust Bayesian inference through the use of disparities. Metrics such as Hellinger distance and negative exponential disparity have a long history in robust estimation in frequentist inference. We demonstrate that an equivalent robustification may be made in Bayesian inference by substituting an appropriately scaled disparity for the log likelihood to which standard Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods may be applied. A particularly appealing property of minimum-disparity methods is that while they yield robustness with a breakdown point of 1/2, the resulting parameter estimates are also efficient when the posited probabilistic model is correct. We demonstrate that a similar property holds for disparity-based Bayesian inference. We further show that in the Bayesian setting, it is also possible to extend these methods to robustify regression models, random effects distributions and other hierarchical models. These models require integrating out a random effect; this is achieved via MCMC but would otherwise be numerically challenging. The methods are demonstrated on real-world data.","Deviance test,Kernel density,Hellinger distance,Negative exponential disparity,MCMC,Bayesian inference,Posterior,Outliers","MINIMUM HELLINGER DISTANCE,DIVERGENCE MEASURES,LOCATION PARAMETER,INFERENCE,EFFICIENCY,POSTERIOR","Hooker, Giles@Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA::Vidyashankar, Anand N.@George Mason Univ, Dept Stat, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Hooker, Giles@Cornell University::Vidyashankar, Anand N.@George Mason University",not exist,"LearnBayes: functions for learning Bayesian inference+Albert, J.+R package version 2+2008::An Introduction to R+Albert, Jim+BAYESIAN COMPUTATION WITH R, SECOND EDITION+2009::Bayesian Robustness Modeling Using Regularly Varying Distributions+Andrade, J.

On normal stable Tweedie models and power-generalized variance functions of only one component,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0363-9,SEP 2014,38,5,"As an extension to normal gamma and normal inverse Gaussian models, all normal stable Tweedie (NST) models are introduced for getting a simple form of the determinant of the covariance matrix, so-called generalized variance. As alternatives to the standard normal model, multivariate NST models are composed by a fixed univariate stable Tweedie variable having a positive value domain, and the remaining random variables given the fixed one are real independent Gaussian variables with the same variance equal to the fixed component. Within the framework of exponential dispersion models, a new form of variance functions is firstly established. Then, their generalized variance functions are shown to be powers of only the fixed mean component. Their modified L,vy measures are generally of the normal gamma type, which is connected to NST models through some Monge-AmpSre equations. Two kinds of generalized variance estimators are discussed and variance modelling under only observations of normal terms is evoked. Finally, reasonable extensions of NST to multiple stable Tweedie models and corresponding problems are presented.","Covariance matrix,Determinant,Generalized variance estimator,Levy measure,Monge-Ampere equation,Multivariate exponential dispersion model","NATURAL EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES,NONCENTRAL GAMMA-DISTRIBUTION,POISSON-GAUSSIAN FAMILIES,MONGE-AMPERE EQUATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,COMPUTATION","Mainassara, Yacouba Boubacar@Univ Franche Comte, UFR Sci & Tech, Lab Math Besancon, UMR CNRS UFC 6623, F-25030 Besancon, France::Kokonendji, Celestin C.@Univ Franche Comte, UFR Sci & Tech, Lab Math Besancon, UMR CNRS UFC 6623, F-25030 Besancon, France","Mainassara, Yacouba Boubacar@Universite de Franche-Comte@Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte (ComUE)::Kokonendji, Celestin C.@Universite de Franche-Comte@Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte (ComUE)",not exist,"Robust Hotelling's T-2 control charts under non-normality: the case of t-Student distribution+Alfaro, Jose-Luis; Ortega, Juan-Fco.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2012::Wavelet shrinkage for natural exponential families with cubic variance functions+Antoniadis, A; Besbeas, P; Sapatinas, T.+Sankhya A+2001::The diagonal multivariate natural exponential families and their classification+Bar-Lev, S; Bschouty, D; Enis, P<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Letac, G; Lu, I; Richard, D</span>.+J Theor Probab+1994::Processes of normal inverse Gaussian type+Barndorff-Nielsen, O.

On complete convergence for widely orthant-dependent random variables and its applications in nonparametric regression models,TEST,10.1007/s11749-014-0365-7,SEP 2014,44,38,"In this paper, some probability inequalities and moment inequalities for widely orthant-dependent (WOD, in short) random variables are presented, especially the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund type inequality and Rosenthal type inequality. By using these inequalities, we further study the complete convergence for weighted sums of arrays of row-wise WOD random variables and give some special cases, which extend some corresponding ones for dependent sequences. As applications, we present some sufficient conditions to prove the complete consistency for the estimator of nonparametric regression model based on WOD errors by using the complete convergence that we established. At last, the choice of the fixed design points and the weight functions for the nearest neighbor estimates is proposed. Our results generalize some known results for independent random variables and some dependent random variables.","Widely orthant-dependent random variables,Complete convergence,Nonparametric regression model,Complete consistency,Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund type inequality,Rosenthal type inequality","FIXED-DESIGN REGRESSION,PRECISE LARGE DEVIATIONS,LINEAR-TIME SERIES,WEIGHTED SUMS,NOD SEQUENCE,EXPONENTIAL INEQUALITIES,UNIFORM ASYMPTOTICS,LARGE NUMBERS,STRONG LAW,ARRAYS","Wang, Xuejun@Anhui Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China::Xu, Chen@Anhui Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China::Hu, Tien-Chung@Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Math, Hsinchu 30043, Taiwan::Volodin, Andrei@Univ Regina, Dept Math & Stat, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada::Hu, Shuhe@Anhui Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China","Wang, Xuejun@Anhui University::Xu, Chen@Anhui University::Hu, Tien-Chung@National Tsing Hua University::Volodin, Andrei@University of Regina::Hu, Shuhe@Anhui University",not exist,"Rosenthal's Type Inequalities for Negatively Orthant Dependent Random Variables+Asadian, N.; Fakoor, V.; Bozorgnia, A.+JIRSS-JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN STATISTICAL SOCIETY+NOV 2006::On the complete convergence of weighted sums for arrays of negatively associated variables+Baek, Jong-Il; Choi, In-Bong; Niu, Si-Li+JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN STATISTICAL SOCIETY+2008::ON COMPLETE CONVERGENCE FOR ARRAYS OF ROW-WISE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED RANDOM VARIABLES+Chen, P.; Hu, T. -C.; Liu, X.; et al.+THEORY OF PROBABILITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS+2008::Uniform asymptotics for the finite-time ruin probabilities of two kinds of nonstandard bidimensional risk models+Chen, Yang; Wang, Le; Wang, Yuebao+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS+MAY 1 2013::THE STRONG LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS FOR EXTENDED NEGATIVELY DEPENDENT RANDOM VARIABLES+Chen, Yiqing; Chen, Anyue; Ng, Kai W.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+DEC 2010::Precise Large Deviations of Random Sums in Presence of Negative Dependence and Consistent Variation+Chen, Yiqing; Yuen, Kam C.; Ng, Kai W.+METHODOLOGY AND COMPUTING IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+DEC 2011::A connection between supermodular ordering and positive/negative association+Christofides, TC; Vaggelatou, E+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2004::MULTIVARIATE NEGATIVE DEPENDENCE+EBRAHIMI, N; GHOSH, M+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1981::CONSISTENT NONPARAMETRIC MULTIPLE-REGRESSION FOR DEPENDENT HETEROGENEOUS PROCESSES - THE FIXED DESIGN CASE+FAN, Y+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+APR 1990::Local properties of function fitting estimates with applications to system identification+Georgiev, AA.+Mathematical statistics and applications+1983::Asymptotic lower bounds of precise large deviations with nonnegative and dependent random variables+He, Wei; Cheng, Dongya; Wang, Yuebao+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JAN 2013::Fixed-design regression for linear time series+Hu, SH; Zhu, CH; Chen, YB; et al.+ACTA MATHEMATICA SCIENTIA+JAN 2002::Negatively superadditive dependence of random variables with applications+Hu, TZ.+Chin J Appl Probab Stat+2000::NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION OF RANDOM-VARIABLES, WITH APPLICATIONS+JOAGDEV, K; PROSCHAN, F+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1983::On complete convergence for arrays+Kruglov, Victor M.; Volodin, Andrei I.; Hu, Tien-Chung+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+SEP 1 2006::Asymptotic properties for estimates of nonparametric regression models based on negatively associated sequences+Liang, HY; Jing, BY+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2005::Necessary and sufficient conditions for moderate deviations of dependent random variables with heavy tails+Liu Li+SCIENCE CHINA-MATHEMATICS+JUN 2010::Precise large deviations for dependent random variables with heavy tails+Liu, Li+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 1 2009::A note on a dependent risk model with constant interest rate+Liu, Xijun; Gao, Qingwu; Wang, Yuebao+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+APR 2012::no title+Petrov, V.
