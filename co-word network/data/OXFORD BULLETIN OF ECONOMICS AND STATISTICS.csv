The measurement of low pay in the UK Labour Force Survey,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.64.s.5,2002,21,12,"Consideration of the National Minimum Wage requires estimates of the distribution of hourly pay. The UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a key source of such estimates. The approach most frequently adopted by researchers has been to measure hourly earnings from several questions on pay and hours. The Office for National Statistics is now applying a new approach, based on an alternative more direct measurement introduced in March 1999. These two measures do not produce identical values and this paper investigates sources of discrepancies and concludes that the new variable is more accurate. The difficulty with using the new variable is that it is only available on a subset of respondents. An approach is developed in which missing values of the new variable are replaced by imputed values. The assumptions underlying this imputation approach and results of applying it to LFS data are presented. The relation to weighting approaches is also discussed.",,"MEASUREMENT ERROR,MULTIPLE IMPUTATION,EARNINGS,EXTENT","Skinner, C@Univ Southampton, Dept Social Stat, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Off Natl Stat, London SW1V 2QQ, England::Stuttard, N@Univ Southampton, Dept Social Stat, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Off Natl Stat, London SW1V 2QQ, England::Beissel-Durrant, G@Univ Southampton, Dept Social Stat, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Off Natl Stat, London SW1V 2QQ, England::Jenkins, J@Univ Southampton, Dept Social Stat, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Off Natl Stat, London SW1V 2QQ, England","Skinner, C@University of Southampton@Unknow::Stuttard, N@University of Southampton@Unknow::Beissel-Durrant, G@University of Southampton@Unknow::Jenkins, J@University of Southampton@Unknow",not exist,"no title+BEISSEL G+VARIANCE ESTIMATION+2002::Measurement error in the current population survey: A nonparametric look+Bollinger, CR+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JUL 1998::EVIDENCE ON THE VALIDITY OF CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL LABOR-MARKET DATA+BOUND, J; BROWN, C; DUNCAN, GJ; et al.+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JUL 1994::THE EXTENT OF MEASUREMENT ERROR IN LONGITUDINAL EARNINGS DATA - DO 2 WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT+BOUND, J; KRUEGER, AB+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JAN 1991::Modeling earnings measurement error: A multiple imputation approach+Brownstone, D; Valletta, RG+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1996::no title+CHEN J+J OFF STAT+2000::THE EFFECT OF MEASUREMENT ERROR+CHESHER, A+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1991::no title+DICKENS R+533 LSE CTR EC PERF+2002::AN INVESTIGATION OF THE EXTENT AND CONSEQUENCES OF MEASUREMENT ERROR IN LABOR-ECONOMIC SURVEY DATA+DUNCAN, GJ; HILL, DH+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+1985::no title+ELLIOT D+GSS METHODOLOGY SERI+1999::ESTIMATION IN THE PRESENCE OF MEASUREMENT ERROR+FULLER, WA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1995::Multiple imputation for the fatal accident reporting system+Heitjan, D.

Spatial crime patterns and the introduction of the UK minimum wage,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.64.s.6,2002,27,18,"This paper provides an empirical evaluation of whether one can uncover a link between crime and the labour market using a research methodology that is different to that utilized in existing work. We exploit a large regulatory change that was made to the UK labour market when a national minimum wage was introduced in April 1999. This minimum wage introduction provided pay increases for quite a large number of low paid workers. From a theoretical perspective we argue that this wage boost could have altered individual incentives to participate in crime. We then go on to develop empirical tests of this hypothesis comparing spatial crime patterns, measured at police force area level, in the years before and after the introduction of the minimum wage floor. Our empirical study of area-level crime rates before and after the minimum wage introduction uncovers a statistically significant link between changes in crime and the extent of area low pay before the minimum wage was introduced. Overall our results are in line with the notion that altering wage incentives can affect crime and therefore that there exists a link between crime and the low wage labour market.",,"UNITED-STATES,MARKET,RATES","Hansen, K@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Sociol, London WC2A 2AE, England@UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England::Machin, S@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Sociol, London WC2A 2AE, England@UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England","Hansen, K@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University of London@University College London@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London::Machin, S@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University of London@University College London@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London",not exist,"Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach+Becker, G.+Journal of Political Economy+1968::no title+Box, S.+Recession, Crime and Punishment+1987::no title+BROWN C+HDB LABOR EC+1999::USING REGIONAL VARIATION IN WAGES TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF THE FEDERAL MINIMUM-WAGE+CARD, D+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+OCT 1992::RATES OF CRIME AND UNEMPLOYMENT - AN ANALYSIS OF AGGREGATE RESEARCH EVIDENCE+CHIRICOS, TG+SOCIAL PROBLEMS+APR 1987::no title+DICKENS R+IN PRESS J ROYAL STA+2001::The effects of minimum wages on employment: Theory and evidence from Britain+Dickens, R; Machin, S; Manning, A+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JAN 1999::Labor market institutions and the distribution of wages, 1973-1992: A semiparametric approach+DiNardo, J; Fortin, NM; Lemieux, T+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 1996::Crime, punishment, and the market for offenses+Ehrlich, I+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+WIN 1996::PARTICIPATION IN ILLEGITIMATE ACTIVITIES - THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION+EHRLICH, I+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1973::Crime and work+Fagan, J; Freeman, RB.+CRIME JUSTICE REV RE+1999::The Economics of Crime+Freeman, R.B.+HDB LABOR EC+1999::Crime rates and local labor market opportunities in the United States: 1979-1997+Gould, ED; Weinberg, BA; Mustard, DB+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2002::Market wages and youth crime+Grogger, J+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+OCT 1998::An Economic Model of Recent Trends in Violence+Grogger, Jeff.+The Crime Drop in America+2000::no title+HANSEN K+IN PRESS J QUANTITAT+2002::THE MINIMUM-WAGE LAW AND YOUTH CRIMES - TIME-SERIES EVIDENCE+HASHIMOTO, M+JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; ECONOMICS+OCT 1987::no title+*HOM OFF+HOM OFF STAT B+1999::Wage inequality in the United States during the 1980s: Rising dispersion or falling minimum wage?+Lee, DS+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1999::no title+MACHIN S+CRIME EC INCENTIVES+2001::no title+MAY S+THESIS MIT MA+2000::no title+MCDONALD Z+BRIT J CRIMINOL+2001::The Low Pay Commission and the national minimum wage+Metcalf, D+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+FEB 1999::no title+MOCAN HN+NATL BUREAU EC RES W+2001::Crime, Deterrence and Unemployment in England and Wales: An Empirical Analysis+Reilly, Barry; Witt, Robert.+Bulletin of Economic Research+1996::no title+STEWART M+UNPUB IMPACT INTRO U+2001::Crime and economic activity - A panel data approach+Witt, R; Clarke, A; Fielding, N+BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY+SUM 1999"
Looking for a needle in a haystack? A re-examination of the time series relationship between teenage employment and minimum wages in the United States,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.64.s.7,2002,23,16,"The work of Card and Krueger has cast doubt on the nature of the relationship between the minimum wage and teenage employment in the United States. The earlier 'consensus' finding of a small but statistically significant negative effect was based on time series data whereas Card and Krueger's findings are based mainly on cross-section data. In this article, we re-examine the time series relationship between minimum wage and teenage employment. We find that previous models break down due to their inability to capture changes in the trend, cyclical and seasonal components of teenage employment. We propose an alternative approach in which these components are treated as stochastic components and which contains the traditional, deterministic approach as a special case. The model when estimated up to 1979 accurately predicts what happens to teenage employment subsequently, when the minimum wage was frozen after 1981 and then increased quite substantially in the early 1990s. Moreover, we find that there is a significant, negative effect of the minimum wage on teenage employment and its size has hardly changed during the 1980s and early 1990s.",,"DYNAMIC REGRESSION-MODELS,TRENDS","Bazen, S@Univ Montesxquieu Bordeaux 4, GRAPE, F-33608 Pessac, France@Univ Mediterrane, Ctr Vieille Charite, GREQAM, F-13002 Marseille, France::Marimoutou, V@Univ Montesxquieu Bordeaux 4, GRAPE, F-33608 Pessac, France@Univ Mediterrane, Ctr Vieille Charite, GREQAM, F-13002 Marseille, France","Bazen, S@Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine (ComUE)@Universite de Bordeaux@Aix-Marseille Universite::Marimoutou, V@Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine (ComUE)@Universite de Bordeaux@Aix-Marseille Universite",not exist,"no title+BAZEN S+APPL EC ASS C IN EMP+1999::no title+BERNSTEIN J+MAKING WORK PAY IMPA+1998::MYTH AND MEASUREMENT - THE NEW ECONOMICS OF THE MINIMUM-WAGE - CARD,D, KRUEGER,AB+BROWN, C+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+JUL 1995::no title+BROWN C+J HUMAN RESOURCE WIN+1983::THE EFFECT OF THE MINIMUM-WAGE ON EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT+BROWN, C; GILROY, C; KOHEN, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+1982::no title+BURKHAUSER R+J LABOR EC       OCT+2000::Minimum wages and employment: A case study of the fast-food industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Reply+Card, D; Krueger, AB+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2000::no title+Card, D.; Krueger, A.+Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage+1995::EMPLOYMENT AND THE 1990-1991 MINIMUM-WAGE HIKE+DEERE, D; MURPHY, KM; WELCH, F+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1995::MYTH AND MEASUREMENT - THE NEW ECONOMICS OF THE MINIMUM-WAGE - CARD,D, KRUEGER,AB+HAMERMESH, DS+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+JUL 1995::Trends, cycles and autoregressions+Harvey, A+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JAN 1997::SEASONALITY IN DYNAMIC REGRESSION-MODELS+HARVEY, A; SCOTT, A+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+NOV 1994::no title+Harvey, A.

Semiparametric estimation of a duration model,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,NO DOI,DEC 2001,17,7,"Within the framework of the proportional hazard model proposed in Cox (1972), Man and Hausman (1990) consider the logarithm of the integrated baseline hazard function as constant in each time period. We, however, proposed an alternative semiparametric estimator of the parameters of the covariate part. The estimator is considered as semiparametric since no prespecified functional form for the error terms (or certain convolution) is needed. This estimator, proposed in Lewbel (2000) in another context, shows at least four advantages. The distribution of the latent variable error is unknown and may be related to the regressors. It takes into account censored observations, it allows for heterogeneity of unknown form and it is quite easy to implement since the estimator does not require numerical searches. Using the Spanish Labour Force Survey, we compare empirically the results of estimating several alternative models, basically on the estimator proposed in Han and Hausman (1990) and our semiparametric estimator.",,"UNEMPLOYMENT-INSURANCE,SPELLS","Anton, AA@Univ Basque Country, Dept Econometria & Estadist, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain@Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Cantabria, Spain::Sainz, AF@Univ Basque Country, Dept Econometria & Estadist, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain@Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Cantabria, Spain::Rodriguez-Poo, J@Univ Basque Country, Dept Econometria & Estadist, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain@Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Cantabria, Spain","Anton, AA@University of Basque Country@Universidad de Cantabria::Sainz, AF@University of Basque Country@Universidad de Cantabria::Rodriguez-Poo, J@University of Basque Country@Universidad de Cantabria","Rodriguez-Poo, Juan Manuel@F-6994-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8751-3025::Fernandez-Sainz, Ana@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6574-2433","no title+BOVER O+ESTUDIOS EC BANCO ES+1997::Regression models and life tables+Cox, D.

Break point estimation and spurious rejections with endogenous unit root tests,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00234,DEC 2001,12,163,"This paper examines the accuracy of break point estimation using the endogenous break unit root tests of Zivot and Andrews (1992) and Perron (1997). We find that these tests tend to identify the break point incorrectly at one-period behind (T-B - 1) the true break point (T-B), where bias in estimating the persistence parameter and spurious rejections are the greatest. In addition, this outcome occurs under the null and alternative hypotheses, and more so as the magnitude of the break increases. Consequences of utilizing these endogenous break tests are similar to (incorrectly) omitting the break term B-t in Perron's (1989) exogenous test.",,"OIL-PRICE SHOCK,GREAT CRASH,HYPOTHESIS","Lee, J@Univ Cent Florida, Dept Econ, Orlando, FL 32816 USA@Univ N Texas, Dept Econ, Denton, TX 76203 USA::Strazicich, MC@Univ Cent Florida, Dept Econ, Orlando, FL 32816 USA@Univ N Texas, Dept Econ, Denton, TX 76203 USA","Lee, J@University of Central Florida@State University System of Florida@University of North Texas Denton@University of North Texas System::Strazicich, MC@University of Central Florida@State University System of Florida@University of North Texas Denton@University of North Texas System","Strazicich, Mark@A-8457-2009","AN LM TEST FOR A UNIT-ROOT IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRUCTURAL-CHANGE+AMSLER, C; LEE, JS+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 1995::REAL EXCHANGE-RATES UNDER THE GOLD STANDARD - CAN THEY BE EXPLAINED BY THE TREND BREAK MODEL+CULVER, SE; PAPELL, DH+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+AUG 1995::no title+HARVEY D+UNPUB INNOVATIONAL O+2001::Are US regional incomes converging?

Then, using the estimated coefficients from these models, we apply a variant of Oaxaca's decomposition approach to divide the gap in average promotions by gender into two parts: one of them due to differences in endowments and the other is associated with differences in the 'return' of such as endowments in terms of opportunities of upward mobility.

Child growth in the time of drought,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.t01-1-00227,SEP 2001,77,123,"This paper examines the impact of rainfall shocks on a measure of child health, growth in height, drawing on a unique household panel data set from rural Zimbabwe. We find that children aged 12 to 24 months lose 1.5-2 cm of growth in the aftermath of a drought. Catch-up growth in these children is limited so that this growth faltering has a permanent effect. By contrast, there is no evidence that older children experience a slowdown in growth. There is some evidence that the loss in growth is unequally distributed with children residing in poorer households and offspring of women who are daughters of the household head appearing to be especially vulnerable.",,"INCOME RURAL-AREAS,SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS,CREDIT MARKETS,CONSUMPTION,NUTRITION,ZIMBABWE,RETURNS,POLICY,INDIA,RISK","Hoddinott, J@Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada@Free Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands@Univ Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe::Kinsey, B@Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada@Free Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands@Univ Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe","Hoddinott, J@Dalhousie University@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam@University of Zimbabwe::Kinsey, B@Dalhousie University@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam@University of Zimbabwe",not exist,"Child health and school enrollment - A longitudinal analysis+Alderman, H; Behrman, JR; Lavy, V; et al.+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+WIN 2001::The returns to endogenous human capital in Pakistan's rural wage labour market+Alderman, H; Behrman, JR; Ross, DR; et al.+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1996::no title+ALDERMAN H+UNPUB INCOME EC SHOC+1994::no title+ALDERMAN H+UNPUB LONG TERM CONS+2001::UNITARY VERSUS COLLECTIVE MODELS OF THE HOUSEHOLD - IS IT TIME TO SHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF+ALDERMAN, H; CHIAPPORI, PA; HADDAD, L; et al.+WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER+FEB 1995::no title+ARMSTRONG A+STRUGGLING SCARES RE+1997::Postnatal growth patterns of full-term low birth weight infants in Northeast Brazil are related to socioeconomic status+Ashworth, A; Morris, SS; Lira, PIC+JOURNAL OF NUTRITION+OCT 1997::no title+BEATON G+12 ACC SCN+1993::An economic analysis of fertility+Becker, G.S.+Demographic and Economic Change in Developing Countries+1960::no title+BEHRMAN J+UNPUB DYNAMIC DECISI+1995::Health and Nutrition+Behrman, J.

Does measurement error bias fixed-effects estimates of the union wage effect?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00228,SEP 2001,16,9,"This paper compares estimates of the union wage effect using cross-section and panel estimators for male manual full-time and female employees using data from the British Household Panel Survey, 1991-1997. A comparison of cross-section and panel estimates suggests that unobserved heterogeneity biases cross-section estimates upwards. However, it is also found that the divergence between estimates is overstated because measurement error biases the fixed-effects estimates downward. Reducing measurement error in the union variable by taking averages and restricting changes in union status to occur only when a change in employer and/or job takes place increases fixed-effects estimates of the union wage effect.",,"LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS,BRITAIN","Swaffield, JK@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England","Swaffield, JK@University of London@London School Economics & Political Science",not exist,"The Estimation of Union Wage Differentials and the Impact of Methodological Choices+Andrews, Martyn J; Stewart, Mark B; Swaffield, Joanna K<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Upward, Richard</span>.+Labour Economics+1998::Union coverage differentials.

Mean reversion of interest rates in the Eurocurrency market,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00229,SEP 2001,39,19,"One stylised fact to emerge from the empirical analysis of interest rates is that the unit-root hypothesis in nominal interest rates cannot be rejected. However, using the panel date unit-root test IM, Pesaran and Shin (1997), we find support for the mean-reverting property of Eurocurrency rates. Thus, neither a vector-error-correction model nor a vector autoregressive model in differences is appropriate for modelling Eurocurrency rates. Instead, conventional modelling strategies with level data are appropriate. Furthermore, the finding of stationary interest rates supports uncovered interest parity, and hence the convergence hypothesis of interest rates. This in turn suggests a limited role for a monetary authority to affect domestic interest rates.",,"PURCHASING POWER PARITY,REAL EXCHANGE-RATES,UNIT-ROOT,TIME-SERIES,PANEL-DATA,LONG-RUN,INFLATION,TRENDS,TESTS,COINTEGRATION","Wu, JL@Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 621, Taiwan@Fujen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 221, Taiwan::Chen, SL@Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 621, Taiwan@Fujen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 221, Taiwan","Wu, JL@National Chung Cheng University@Fu Jen Catholic University::Chen, SL@National Chung Cheng University@Fu Jen Catholic University",not exist,"PURCHASING POWER PARITY IN THE LONG-RUN+ABUAF, N; JORION, P+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+MAR 1990::COMMON STOCHASTIC TRENDS IN A SYSTEM OF EUROCURRENCY RATES+ARSHANAPALLI, B; DOUKAS, J+JOURNAL OF BANKING &amp; FINANCE+DEC 1994::Analysing inflation by the fractionally integrated ARFIMA-GARCH model+Baillie, RT; Chung, CF; Tieslau, MA+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1996::no title+BERKOWITZ J+FINANCE EC DISCUSSIO+1996::A multivariate cointegration analysis of interest rates in the Eurocurrency market+Bremnes, H; Gjerde, O; Saettem, F+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+OCT 1997::no title+BREUER JB+SERIES SPECIFIC TEST+1999::The contribution of platelet dysfunction to postbypass bleeding.+Campbell, F W+Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia+1991-Dec::no title+CAMPBELL JY+NBER MACROECON ANN+1991::LAG ORDER AND CRITICAL-VALUES OF A MODIFIED DICKEY-FULLER TEST+CHEUNG, YW; LAI, KS+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1995::COINTEGRATION AND TESTS OF PURCHASING POWER PARITY+CORBAE, D; OULIARIS, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1988::Is there a unit root in the inflation rate?

The instability of the money demand function: an I(2) interpretation,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00230,SEP 2001,17,5,"Some studies have suggested that although money and prices appear to be I(2) processes, real money balances are I(1) and this trans format ion preserves an important long-run relationship between money and prices. In this paper we present evidence indicating that the success of such a nominal-to-real transformation depends upon the particular monetary aggregate under consideration. It turns out that imposing long-run price homogeneity does not remove all I(2) components from a model of aggregate broad UK M4, but it does prove successful in the case of sectoral components of M4. Since recent research on money demand functions finds more stable relationships between sectoral components of M4 and aggregate demand, our analysis seems to point to a direct link between the existence of I(2) components and the stability of different money demand functions.",,MONETARY,"Fiess, N@Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G4 OLN, Lanark, Scotland::MacDonald, R@Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G4 OLN, Lanark, Scotland","Fiess, N@University of Strathclyde::MacDonald, R@University of Strathclyde",not exist,"no title+ASTLEY MS+BANK ENGLAND Q B MAY+1997::AN ADMISSIBLE MONETARY AGGREGATE FOR THE UNITED-KINGDOM+BELONGIA, MT; CHRYSTAL, KA+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1991::no title+BROOKES M+MONEY FINANCIAL MARK+1991::no title+DALE S+BANK ENGLAND Q B NOV+1995::An econometric analysis of I (2) variables+Haldrup, Niels.+Journal of Economic Surveys+1998::no title+HALL SG+41 BANK ENGL+1989::Modelling the demand for M4 in the UK+Hurn, AS; Muscatelli, VA+MANCHESTER SCHOOL OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STUDIES+MAR 1996::A STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF COINTEGRATION FOR I(2) VARIABLES+JOHANSEN, S+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+MAR 1995::A REPRESENTATION OF VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE PROCESSES INTEGRATED OF ORDER-2+JOHANSEN, S+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 1992::no title+Johansen, S.+Likelihood-based inference in cointegrated vector autoregressive models+1995::no title+JOHANSEN S+MAN SIMULATION PROGR+1993::no title+JORGENSEN C+IN PRESS J ECONOMETR+1996::A structured VAR for Denmark under changing monetary regimes+Juselius, K+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 1998::no title+KONGSTED HC+UNPUB TESTING NOMINA+1999::On the determination of integration indices in I(2) systems+Paruolo, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY-JUN 1996::ESTIMATING LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIPS FROM DYNAMIC HETEROGENEOUS PANELS+PESARAN, MH; SMITH, R+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::no title+THOMAS R+BANK ENGLAND Q B MAY+1996"

Workers who are married, have full-time jobs, work overtime, are employed in large establishments and high-level occupations, and come from more recent cohorts have significantly higher chances of promotion.

Wages and politics: evidence from the Norwegian public sector,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00223,JUL 2001,29,4,The paper presents empirical results for wage setting in the Norwegian local and central public sector. Our results imply that central and local government wages are completely autonomous processes both in the short-ran and in the long-ran. This suggests that the formal strong coordination of wage setting in the two sectors at the national level does not determine the final outcome. We find that a stronger central government will reduce wages in the local government sector. The evidence also suggests an electoral cycle in the local but not in the central government sector.,,"ECONOMY,MODEL","Johansen, K@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway::Strom, B@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Johansen, K@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)::Strom, B@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)",not exist,"Inflation in the Open Economy+Aukrust, Odd.+Worldwide Inflation: Theory and Recent Experience+1977::no title+BORGE L+UNPUB LOCAL GOVT SPE+1994::ELECTORAL CYCLES AND THE EARNINGS OF FEDERAL BUREAUCRATS+BORJAS, GJ+ECONOMIC INQUIRY+1984::no title+BORLAND J+COMMONWEALTH GRANTS+1995::no title+BRUNELLO G+POLITICA EC+1996::no title+DOORNIK JA+MODELLING DYNAMIC SY+1996::no title+DOORNIK JA+UNPUB PRACTICAL MULT+1994::EXOGENEITY+ENGLE, RF; HENDRY, DF; RICHARD, JF+ECONOMETRICA+1983::Political economic determinants of school spending in federalist states: theory and time-series evidence+Falch, T; Rattso, J.+European Journal of Political Economy+1997::no title+Harvey, A.

Do high interest rates appreciate exchange rates during crisis? The Korean evidence,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00225,JUL 2001,34,5,This paper tries to answer the following basic question: Have the high interest rates had the desired effect of appreciating the nominal exchange rates in the Asian crisis countries? We use Korean high-frequency (weekly) data during the crisis and its aftermath to examine the relationship between the increase in interest rates and the behaviour of exchange rates. We find that the lead-tag relation between the exchange rate and the interest rate clearly indicates that raising the interest rate has had the usual impact of appreciating the nominal exchange rate during the crisis period.,,"COINTEGRATION VECTORS,TIME-SERIES,UNIT-ROOT,REGRESSION,MODELS","Dekle, R@Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA::Hsiao, C@Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA::Wang, SY@Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA","Dekle, R@University of Southern California@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@University of Delaware::Hsiao, C@University of Southern California@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@University of Delaware::Wang, SY@University of Southern California@Hong Kong University of Science & Technology@University of Delaware",not exist,"Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2nd International Symposium on Information Theory+1973::no title+Anderson, T.

The consequences of different bandwidth choices, used to identify close-equals groups to estimate the horizontal effect, are discussed. Two opposing forces are identified which militate against choosing a very small or large bandwidth. It is suggested that the best procedure is to use the bandwidth that maximises the estimated vertical component, compute the reranking component exactly as a sample statistic and obtain the horizontal effect by subtraction. The technique is used to analyse the progressivity of tax and transfer payments in Australia.",,"GINI COEFFICIENT,INCOME","van de Ven, J@Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England@Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia@Univ York, York YO1 5DD, N Yorkshire, England::Creedy, J@Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England@Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia@Univ York, York YO1 5DD, N Yorkshire, England::Lambert, PJ@Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England@Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia@Univ York, York YO1 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","van de Ven, J@University of Oxford@University of Melbourne@University of York - UK::Creedy, J@University of Oxford@University of Melbourne@University of York - UK::Lambert, PJ@University of Oxford@University of Melbourne@University of York - UK",not exist,"REDISTRIBUTIVE EFFECT AND UNEQUAL INCOME-TAX TREATMENT+ARONSON, JR; JOHNSON, P; LAMBERT, PJ+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAR 1994::DECOMPOSING THE GINI COEFFICIENT TO REVEAL THE VERTICAL HORIZONTAL, AND RERANKING EFFECTS OF INCOME TAXATION+ARONSON, JR; LAMBERT, PJ+NATIONAL TAX JOURNAL+JUN 1994::no title+ATKINSON A+EC TAXATION+1979::REGIONAL DISPARITIES IN HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION IN INDIA+BHATTACHARYA, N; MAHALANOBIS, B+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1967::no title+CREEDY J+647 U MELB DEP EC RE+1998::no title+CREEDY J+782 U MELB DEP EC RE+2001::no title+CREEDY J+IN PRESS AUSTR EC PA+2001::Is redistribution through indirect taxes equitable?+Decoster, A; Schokkaert, E; VanCamp, G+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+APR 1997::no title+DECOSTER A+RES ECON INEQUAL+1997::CALCULATING INCOME-DISTRIBUTION INDEXES FROM MICRO-DATA+JENKINS, S+NATIONAL TAX JOURNAL+MAR 1988::Welfare rankings of income distributions+Kakwani, N.

It is found that neither test uniformily dominates the other one. Moreover it is shown that the asymptotic properites of the estimator of the cointegration rank based on the trace test are shared by a similar estimator based on the lambda max test. These results indicate that both tests are admissible.,,,"Paruolo, P@Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, I-21100 Varese, Italy","Paruolo, P@University of Insubria",not exist,"LIMITING DISTRIBUTIONS OF LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATES OF UNSTABLE AUTOREGRESSIVE PROCESSES+CHAN, NH; WEI, CZ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1988::CONVERGENCE TO STOCHASTIC INTEGRALS FOR DEPENDENT HETEROGENEOUS PROCESSES+HANSEN, BE+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+DEC 1992::no title+Hansen, P.; Johansen, S.+Workbook for cointegration+1998::no title+HENDRY DF+PC NAIVE INTERACTIVE+1990::no title+JOHANSEN S+ECONOMETRIC DECISION+1991::ESTIMATION AND HYPOTHESIS-TESTING OF COINTEGRATION VECTORS IN GAUSSIAN VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS+JOHANSEN, S+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1991::no title+Johansen, S.+Likelihood-Based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models.+1996::DETERMINATION OF COINTEGRATION RANK IN THE PRESENCE OF A LINEAR TREND+JOHANSEN, S+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1992::TESTING FOR UNIT ROOTS IN TIME-SERIES DATA+PANTULA, SG+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 1989::no title+PARUOLO P+UNPUB MONTE CARLO ES+2001"

Does doing badly encourage management innovation?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00207,FEB 2001,15,42,"In this paper we have undertaken an empirical analysis of the notion that firms introduce managerial innovations as a consequence of bad times, as in the 'pit-stop' view of recessions, We first analyze a dynamic model of the firm and conclude that a competitive firm operating in a perfect capital market may well devote more of its employees' time to reorganization and other productivity improving activities during periods where the real output price or productivity is declining (e.g. recessions). We then investigate the hypothesis that a worsening of the firm's situation will lead to the introduction of productivity improving innovations of various kinds. Our individual company data tend to confirm this hypothesis with the single exception that firms tend to become more centralized when their real or financial position declines, despite the general view that it is decentralization which tends to improve the operation of a company in the long run.",,,"Nickell, S@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England@Univ Sheffield, Inst Work Psychol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England::Nicolitsas, D@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England@Univ Sheffield, Inst Work Psychol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England::Patterson, M@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England@Univ Sheffield, Inst Work Psychol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Nickell, S@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University of Sheffield::Nicolitsas, D@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University of Sheffield::Patterson, M@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University of Sheffield",not exist,"no title+AGHION P+UNPUB VIRTUE BAD TIM+1991::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::EXIT FROM DECLINING INDUSTRIES AND THE CASE OF STEEL CASTINGS+BADENFULLER, CWF+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+DEC 1989::no title+BEAN C+1092 CEPR+1995::10 YEARS OF T+BEAN, C; SYMONS, J+NBER MACROECONOMICS ANNUAL+1989::THE CLEANSING EFFECT OF RECESSIONS+CABALLERO, RJ; HAMMOUR, ML+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1994::GROSS JOB CREATION AND DESTRUCTION - MICROECONOMIC EVIDENCE AND MACROECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS+DAVIS, SJ; HALTIWANGER, J+NBER MACROECONOMICS ANNUAL+1990::no title+GALI J+LONG RUN EFFECTS BUS+1991::no title+GERTLER M+SCANDINAVIAN J EC+1993::Labor demand+Hall, R.+Labor Supply, and Employment Volatility, NBER Macroeconomics Annual+1991::THE THATCHER MIRACLE+LAYARD, R; NICKELL, S+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1989::How does financial pressure affect firms?+Nickell, S; Nicolitsas, D+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+AUG 1999::Wages, Restrictive Practices and Productivity+Nickell, S.; Nicolitsas, D.+Labour Economics+1997::Plant Closures and the Productivity Miracle in Manufacturing+Oulton, N.+National Institute Economic Review+1987::PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUSINESS-CYCLE+SAINTPAUL, G+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1993"

We analyze the determinants of undergraduate degree performance using an ordered probit regression model, and find that degree performance is influenced positively by A-level score, positively by occupationally-ranked social class background and is significantly worse both for students who had previously attended an Independent school and for male students. We find that the significance of these effects is robust across different subsamples of the population, and we explore the variation in the magnitude of the effects.

Bounding a matching estimator: the case of a Norwegian training program,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00211,FEB 2001,26,79,"In this paper we evaluate a Norwegian vocational training rehabilitation program by comparing employment outcomes of trainees and nonparticipants using nonexperimental data. A matching estimator is used to calculate the training effect for different subgroups of the sample. We demonstrate how bounding the matching estimator can be used to evaluate the intrinsic uncertainty of estimated training effects due to selection on unobserved individual characteristics.

After adjustment for observed selection into training programs we find that the overall training effect is around six percentage points. This is mainly due to a high and significant effect for individuals with a low probability of program participation. After calculating upper and lower bounds on the test-statistics used to test the hypothesis of no training effect we find that the overall effect is sensitive to unobserved selection. However, the result that the training effect is positive for individuals who are less likely to participate in a training program is not sensitive to selection bias. These individuals also have the lowest employent probabilities, which indicates potential harmful cream skimming in the Norwegian vocational rehabilitation sector.",,"SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION,SELECTION MODELS,SAMPLE SELECTION,EARNINGS,BIAS,IMPACT","Aakvik, A@Univ Bergen, N-5020 Bergen, Norway","Aakvik, A@University of Bergen",not exist,"no title+AAKVIK A+SUCCESS SELECTION NO+1998::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF CENSORED SELECTION MODELS WITH A NONPARAMETRIC SELECTION MECHANISM+AHN, H; POWELL, JL+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1993::USING THE LONGITUDINAL STRUCTURE OF EARNINGS TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF TRAINING-PROGRAMS+ASHENFELTER, O; CARD, D+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+1985::ESTIMATING EFFECT OF TRAINING-PROGRAMS ON EARNINGS+ASHENFELTER, O+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+1978::THE EFFECT OF CETA ON THE POSTPROGRAM EARNINGS OF PARTICIPANTS+BASSI, LJ+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+1983::no title+Bell, S; Orr, L; Blomquist, J<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Cain, G</span>.+Program Applicants as a Comparison Group in Evaluating Training Programs: Theory and a Tes+1995::MEASURING THE EFFECT OF SUBSIDIZED TRAINING-PROGRAMS ON MOVEMENTS IN AND OUT OF EMPLOYMENT+CARD, D; SULLIVAN, D+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1988::THE PLANNING OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES OF HUMAN-POPULATIONS+COCHRAN, WG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-GENERAL+1965::no title+FORD M+INAS RAPPORT+1993::The effect of sample selection and initial conditions in duration models: Evidence from experimental data on training+Ham, JC; LaLonde, RJ+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1996::Characterizing selection bias using experimental data+Heckman, J; Ichimura, H; Smith, J; et al.+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 1998::THE EMPIRICAL CONTENT OF THE ROY MODEL+HECKMAN, JJ; HONORE, BE+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 1990::SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS AS A SPECIFICATION ERROR+HECKMAN, JJ+ECONOMETRICA+1979::ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF INTERVENTIONS - AN OVERVIEW+HECKMAN, JJ; ROBB, R+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT-NOV 1985::CHOOSING AMONG ALTERNATIVE NONEXPERIMENTAL METHODS FOR ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS - THE CASE OF MANPOWER TRAINING+HECKMAN, JJ; HOTZ, VJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1989::no title+Johnson, N.

Weak identification of forward-looking models in monetary economics,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2004.00095.x,SEP 2004,36,37,"Recently, single-equation estimation by the generalized method of moments (GMM) has become popular in the monetary economics literature, for estimating forward-looking models with rational expectations. We discuss a method for analysing the empirical identification of such models that exploits their dynamic structure and the assumption of rational expectations. This allows us to judge the reliability of the resulting GMM estimation and inference and reveals the potential sources of weak identification. With reference to the New Keynesian Phillips curve of Gali and Gertler [Journal of Monetary Economics (1999) Vol. 44, 195] and the forward-looking Taylor rules of Clarida, Gali and Gertler [Quarterly Journal of Economics (2000) Vol. 115, 147], we demonstrate that the usual 'weak instruments' problem can arise naturally, when the predictable variation in inflation is small relative to unpredictable future shocks (news). Hence, we conclude that those models are less reliably estimated over periods when inflation has been under effective policy control.",,"INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES REGRESSION,INFLATION DYNAMICS,GENERALIZED-METHOD,SAMPLE PROPERTIES,POLICY RULES,ESTIMATORS,GMM,EQUATIONS,MOMENTS,TESTS","Mavroeidis, S@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Quantitat Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Mavroeidis, S@University of Amsterdam",not exist,"THE ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF ESTIMATES OF THE PARAMETERS OF A SINGLE EQUATION IN A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS+ANDERSON, TW; RUBIN, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1950::ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS OF DISTRIBUTIONS OF ESTIMATES IN SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS FOR ALTERNATIVE PARAMETER SEQUENCES+ANDERSON, TW+ECONOMETRICA+1977::no title+BATINI N+2 BANK ENGL EXT MPC+2000::no title+BINDER M+HDB APPL ECONOMETRIC+1995::THE SOLUTION OF LINEAR DIFFERENCE MODELS UNDER RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS+BLANCHARD, OJ; KAHN, CM+ECONOMETRICA+1980::no title+BUITER W+MACROECONOMIC THEORY+1989::ASYMPTOTIC AND FINITE-SAMPLE DISTRIBUTION-THEORY FOR IV ESTIMATORS AND TESTS IN PARTIALLY IDENTIFIED STRUCTURAL EQUATIONS+CHOI, I; PHILLIPS, PCB+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1992::Monetary policy rules in practice - Some international evidence+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1998::Monetary policy rules and macroeconomic stability: Evidence and some theory+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2000::Inferring the rank of a matrix+Cragg, JG; Donald, SG+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1997::no title+DODGE D+ANN M AM EC ASS N AM+2002::no title+FUHRER J+Q J ECON+1995::European inflation dynamics+Gali, J; Gertler, M; Lopez-Salido, JD+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2001::Inflation dynamics: A structural econometric analysis+Gali, J; Gertler, M+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+OCT 1999::no title+HAHN J+ECONOMETRICA+2002::Two difficulties in interpreting vector autoregressions+Hansen, L.P.; Sargent, T.J.+Rational Expectations Econometrics+1991::LARGE SAMPLE PROPERTIES OF GENERALIZED-METHOD OF MOMENTS ESTIMATORS+HANSEN, LP+ECONOMETRICA+1982::Finite-sample properties of some alternative GMM estimators+Hansen, LP; Heaton, J; Yaron, A+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1996::IDENTIFICATION OF THE LONG-RUN AND THE SHORT-RUN STRUCTURE - AN APPLICATION TO THE ISLM MODEL+JOHANSEN, S; JUSELIUS, K+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1994::no title+KLEIBERGEN F+0034 TINB I+2003::Pivotal statistics for testing structural parameters in instrumental variables regression+Kleibergen, F+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2002::no title+LUCAS REJ+CARNEGIEROCHESTER C+1976::no title+MAVROEIDIS S+IDENTIFICATION MISSP+2003::no title+MAVROEIDIS S+THESIS OXFORD U OXFO+2002::A conditional likelihood ratio test for structural models+Moreira, MJ+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2003::no title+Pesaran, MH.+The Limits to Rational Expectations+1987::Exact small sample theory in the simultaneous equations model+Phillips, P.

Our resulting estimates of the euro-area NKPCs are robust, provide reasonable estimates for fixed-price durations and discount rates and embody plausible dynamic properties.

Econometric evaluation of the New Keynesian Phillips curve,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2004.00097.x,SEP 2004,36,44,We give an appraisal of the New Keynesian Phillips curve (NPCM) as an empirical model of European inflation. The favourable evidence for NPCMs on euro-area data reported in earlier studies is shown to depend on specific choices made about estimation methodology. The NPCM can be re-interpreted as a highly restricted equilibrium correction model. We also report the outcome of tests based on variable addition and encompassing of existing models. The results show that economists should not accept the NPCM too readily.,,"INFLATION,WAGES,MODEL","Bardsen, G@Norges Bank, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway@Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway::Jansen, ES@Norges Bank, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway@Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway::Nymoen, R@Norges Bank, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway@Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Bardsen, G@Unknow@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)@University of Oslo::Jansen, ES@Unknow@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)@University of Oslo::Nymoen, R@Unknow@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)@University of Oslo","Bardsen, Gunnar@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0834-7872","Inflation in the Open Economy.

On business cycle asymmetries in G7 countries,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2004.00082.x,JUL 2004,46,11,"We investigate whether business cycle dynamics in seven industrialized countries (the G7) are characterized by asymmetries in conditional mean. We provide evidence on this issue using a variety of time series models. Our approach is fully parametric. Our testing strategy is robust to any conditional heteroskedasticity, outliers, and/or long memory that may be present. Our results indicate fairly strong evidence of nonlinearities in the conditional mean dynamics of the GDP growth rates for Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the US. For France and the UK, the conditional mean dynamics appear to be largely linear. Our study shows that while the existence of conditional heteroskedasticity and long memory does not have much effect on testing for linearity in the conditional mean, accounting for outliers does reduce the evidence against linearity.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,CONDITIONAL MEAN DYNAMICS,IMPULSE-RESPONSE ANALYSIS,ECONOMIC TIME-SERIES,REAL GNP,FRACTIONAL ARIMA,LONG MEMORY,PARAMETER,MODELS,HYPOTHESIS","Kiani, KM@Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada@Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA::Bidarkota, PV@Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada@Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Kiani, KM@Wilfrid Laurier University@Florida International University@State University System of Florida::Bidarkota, PV@Wilfrid Laurier University@Florida International University@State University System of Florida",not exist,"Testing multiple equation systems for common nonlinear components+Anderson, HM; Vahid, F+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 1998::US and Canadian industrial production indices as coupled oscillators+Anderson, HM; Ramsey, JB+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+JAN 2002::Testing when a parameter is on the boundary of the maintained hypothesis+Andrews, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 2001::Analysing inflation by the fractionally integrated ARFIMA-GARCH model+Baillie, RT; Chung, CF; Tieslau, MA+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1996::Long memory processes and fractional integration in econometrics+Baillie, RT+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1996::LARGE SHOCKS, SMALL SHOCKS, AND ECONOMIC-FLUCTUATIONS - OUTLIERS IN MACROECONOMIC TIME-SERIES+BALKE, NS; FOMBY, TB+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+APR-JUN 1994::DO RECESSIONS PERMANENTLY CHANGE OUTPUT+BEAUDRY, P; KOOP, G+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+APR 1993::Asymmetries in the conditional mean dynamics of real GNP: Robust evidence+Bidarkota, PV+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2000::Sectoral investigation of asymmetries in the conditional mean dynamics of the real US GDP+Bidarkota, PV+STUDIES IN NONLINEAR DYNAMICS AND ECONOMETRICS+JAN 1999::The Long and Large Decline in US Output Volatility+Blanchard, O.

The main results show that the three sources of knowledge are significant determinants of long-term productivity growth. Further evidence suggests that several factors determine the extent to which each source of knowledge contributes to productivity growth.

The relationship between the parameters of the original I(2) vector autoregression, including the coefficients of polynomially cointegrating relationships, and the transformed l(l) model is characterized. We discuss estimation of the transformed model subject to restrictions as well as the more commonly used approach of unrestricted reduced rank regression. Only a minor loss of efficiency is incurred by ignoring the restrictions in the empirical example and a simulation study.

"A comparison of Johansen's, Bierens' and the subspace algorithm method for cointegration analysis",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2004.00085.x,JUL 2004,22,5,"The methods listed in the title are compared by means of a simulation study and a real world application. The aspects compared via simulations are the performance of the tests for the cointegrating rank and the quality of the estimated cointegrating space. The subspace algorithm method, formulated in the state space framework and thus applicable for vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) processes, performs at least comparably to the Johansen method. Both the Johansen procedure and the subspace algorithm cointegration analysis perform significantly better than Bierens' method. The real-world application is an investigation of the long-run properties of the one-sector neoclassical growth model for Austria. The results do not fully support the implications of the model with respect to cointegration. Furthermore, the results differ greatly between the different methods. The amount of variability depends strongly upon the number of variables considered and huge differences occur for the full system with six variables. Therefore we conclude that the results of such applications with about five or six variables and 100 observations, which are typical in the applied literature, should possibly be interpreted with more caution than is commonly done.",,"SYSTEMS,GROWTH,MODEL","Wagner, M@Univ Bern, Dept Econ, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland@Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Wagner, M@University of Bern@Princeton University",not exist,"no title+BAUER D+ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIE+2003::no title+BAUER D+CANONICAL FORM UNIT+2003::Estimating cointegrated systems using subspace algorithms+Bauer, D; Wagner, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2002::no title+BAUER D+PERFORMANCE SUBSPACE+2003::Nonparametric cointegration analysis+Bierens, HJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1997::no title+BOSWIJK P+TI990124 TINB I+1999::CANONICAL ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE TIME-SERIES+BOX, GEP; TIAO, GC+BIOMETRIKA+1977::INSPECTING THE MECHANISM - AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO THE STOCHASTIC GROWTH-MODEL+CAMPBELL, JY+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+JUN 1994::no title+Hannan, E.

As stylized facts show, the research intensity in most advanced countries has dramatically increased, mostly more than the GDP. Yet, the growth rates have roughly remained constant or even declined. In this paper we modify the Romer endogenous growth model and test our variant of the model using time series data. We estimate the market version both for the US and Germany for the time period January 1962 to April 1996. Our results demonstrate that the model is compatible with the time series for aggregate data in those countries.

Investment in fixed capital stock: Testing for the impact of sectoral and systemic uncertainty,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1046/j.0305-9049.2003.00078.x,MAY 2004,63,25,"This paper applies current theory recognizing the irreversibility of investment, in order to test for the impact of uncertainty on investment expenditure for a middle income country. The contribution of the paper is unique in two respects. First, it employs dynamic heterogeneous panel estimation techniques not previously applied to investment functions. Secondly, it explicitly tests for the impact of both sectoral and systemic uncertainty on investment expenditure. We find that both sectoral (as measured by output volatility) and systemic uncertainty (as measured by political instability) have a negative impact on investment rates in a middle income country context. Liquidity constraints and growth in total factor productivity are found to have no impact on investment, while trade liberalization has the impact predicted by Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory. Finally, we find complementarity effects between physical capital and skilled human capital, suggesting that South African educational policies may have hampered investment in physical capital as well as the growth performance of the economy. Policy implications emphasize the importance of lowering uncertainty for investors, and the need for sound human capital investment.",,"DYNAMIC HETEROGENEOUS PANELS,SOUTH-AFRICA,AGGREGATE INVESTMENT,MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT,MODEL,IRREVERSIBILITY,GROWTH,INSTABILITY,BEHAVIOR,MARKET","Fedderke, J@Univ Witwatersrand, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa","Fedderke, J@University of Witwatersrand","Fedderke, Johannes@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4482-5939","A UNIFIED MODEL OF INVESTMENT UNDER UNCERTAINTY+ABEL, AB; EBERLY, JC+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1994::OPTIMAL INVESTMENT UNDER UNCERTAINTY+ABEL, AB+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1983::THE PRESENT VALUE OF PROFITS AND CYCLICAL MOVEMENTS IN INVESTMENT+ABEL, AB; BLANCHARD, OJ+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1986::no title+AIGINGER K+PRODUCTION DECISIONS+1987::Fiscal Policy, Profits, and Investment+Alesina, A.; Ardagna, S.; Perotti, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Schiantarelli, F</span>.+NBER Working Paper No. W7207+1999::Optimal capital policy with irreversible investment+Arrow, K.

Seasonality and wage responsiveness in a developing agrarian economy,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1046/j.0305-9049.2003.00098.x,MAY 2004,26,2,"This paper studies the wage responsiveness of labour supply and demand, simultaneously addressing the twin issues of the non-clearing of developing rural labour markets and seasonality. It employs a data set pertaining to south-central India, and limits itself to the agricultural market for daily-rated labour(by far the predominant form of wage contract in the sample villages). Estimating a theoretically robust and empirically justified disequilibrium model of the agricultural labour market, we find no evidence of backward-bending supply curves or 'vertical' demand curves, contrary to findings in the literature. Further, while the agricultural labour market appears to be in equilibrium during the kharif (or rainy) season, it manifests excess supply in the rabi (or post-rainy) season.",,"DISEQUILIBRIUM,AGRICULTURE,HOUSEHOLDS","Kanwar, S@Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Delhi 110007, India","Kanwar, S@University of Delhi@Delhi School of Economics",not exist,"no title+AHMED I+ILO ARTEP EMPLOYMENT+1980::BIVARIATE PROBIT ANALYSIS - MINIMUM CHI-SQUARE METHODS+AMEMIYA, T+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::no title+Bardhan, P.K.+Land, Labour and Rural Poverty: Essays in Development Economics+1984::LABOR SUPPLY FUNCTIONS IN A POOR AGRARIAN ECONOMY+BARDHAN, PK+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1979::no title+BARDHAN PK+CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEM+1984::no title+Basu, K.+Analytical Development Economics: The Less Developed Economy Revisited.+1998::no title+DREZE J+BALANCE IND AGR EC D+1989::Estimating Labour Demand Functions in Indian Agriculture+Evenson,, R.

Unemployment experiences of young men: on the road to stable employment?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1046/j.0305-9049.2003.00097.x,MAY 2004,44,4,"This study examines the unemployment experiences of young men in the United Kingdom over the period 1982.IV-1998.I. The empirical results show that repeated unemployment is a dominant feature of the UK labour market and that individual heterogeneity affects mainly the incidence of unemployment and only to a much lesser extent the duration of unemployment. We estimate that about 73% of the young unemployed find stable employment before the age of 35. The remaining 27%, concentrated among the lower-skilled, keep returning into unemployment, suggesting structural employment instability. These findings imply that a labour market programme targeted at increasing the employability of the young unemployed would yield long-term benefits by not only getting them out of unemployment but also keeping them out of unemployment.",,"DURATION DEPENDENCE,YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT,MODELS,PERSISTENCE,IMPACT,HETEROGENEITY,TRANSITION,BEHAVIOR,SPELLS,CYCLE","Kalwij, AS@Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","Kalwij, AS@Tilburg University",not exist,"UNEMPLOYMENT SPELLS AND UNEMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE+AKERLOF, GA;

Increases in unemployment insurance (UI) benefit levels had a small disincentive effect on the re-employment hazard on average. Around this average, there were larger disincentive effects for men with elapsed durations between 4 and 18 months, whereas for men unemployed longer than 18 months, or for men resident in the south, the effect was negligible. Re-employment hazards increased when UI exhaustion was imminent, but the change was small.

A consistent approach to cost efficiency measurement,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1046/j.0305-9049.2003.00079.x,FEB 2004,17,1,"Consistent specifications of the allocative inefficiency function in 'cost plus input share equations' systems may be difficult, if not impossible, to find because most plausible ones violate certain reasonable a priori conditions. Moreover, the models to which they lead give rise to highly non-linear likelihood functions that are very hard to estimate. In an effort to confront these difficulties, this paper adapts an idea first suggested by Greene (1993) that allocative inefficiency ought to be related to input prices and allocative distortions in the input share equations. The system of 'cost plus input demand equations' that emerges is estimated by standard seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) techniques using data from private and state firms that operated in Greek manufacturing during the 1979-88 period. Among other findings, the estimates show that overall inefficiency for private and state firms was 63.5% and 102.2%, respectively in comparison with the least inefficient firms in their class. In relative terms these figures imply that state firms were almost 61% less efficient than private firms were. Technical and allocative reasons amounting to 64% and 36%, respectively, accounted for this excess inefficiency of state firms, in addition to differences in the utilization of labour, capital and debt. Lastly, it is found that the magnitudes of technical and allocative inefficiencies depend critically upon a self-consistent specification of the allocative inefficiency function.",,"ELECTRIC-POWER GENERATION,UNITED-STATES,PANEL-DATA,ALLOCATIVE INEFFICIENCY,TECHNICAL INEFFICIENCY,RELATIVE EFFICIENCY,PRIVATE FIRMS,UTILITIES,ENVIRONMENT,ECONOMIES","Bitros, GC@Athens Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece::Tsionas, EG@Athens Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece","Bitros, GC@Athens University of Economics & Business::Tsionas, EG@Athens University of Economics & Business",not exist,"PARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION OF TECHNICAL AND ALLOCATIVE INEFFICIENCY WITH PANEL-DATA+ATKINSON, SE; CORNWELL, C+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+FEB 1994::ESTIMATION OF OUTPUT AND INPUT TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY USING A FLEXIBLE FUNCTIONAL FORM AND PANEL-DATA+ATKINSON, SE; CORNWELL, C+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+FEB 1994::PARAMETRIC EFFICIENCY TESTS, ECONOMIES OF SCALE, AND INPUT DEMAND IN UNITED-STATES ELECTRIC-POWER GENERATION+ATKINSON, SE; HALVORSEN, R+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+1984::THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FIRMS IN A REGULATED ENVIRONMENT - THE CASE OF UNITED-STATES ELECTRIC UTILITIES+ATKINSON, SE; HALVORSEN, R+JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS+APR 1986::Is there an inflation-productivity trade-off ?

The yen real exchange rate may be stationary after all: Evidence from non-linear unit-root tests,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1046/j.0305-9049.2003.00080.x,FEB 2004,48,33,"The empirical literature that tests for purchasing power parity (PPP) by focusing on the stationarity of real exchange rates has so far provided, at best, mixed results. The behaviour of the yen real exchange rate has most stubbornly challenged the PPP hypothesis and deepened this puzzle. This paper contributes to this discussion by providing new evidence on the stationarity of bilateral yen real exchange rates. We employ a non-linear version of the augmented Dickey-Fuller test, based on an exponentially smooth-transition autoregressive model (ESTAR) that enhances the power of the tests against mean-reverting non-linear alternative hypotheses. Our results suggest that the bilateral yen real exchange rates against the other G7 and Asian currencies were mean reverting during the post-Bretton Woods era. Thus, the real yen behaviour may not be so different after all but simply perceived to be so because of the use of a restrictive alternative hypothesis in previous tests.",,"PURCHASING-POWER-PARITY,MEAN-REVERSION,NUISANCE PARAMETER,CURRENT FLOAT,PANEL-DATA,COINTEGRATION,EQUILIBRIUM,PERSPECTIVE,ADJUSTMENT,PUZZLE","Chortareas, G@Bank England, Int Econ Anal Div, London, England@Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Econ, London E1 4NS, England@Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Kapetanios, G@Bank England, Int Econ Anal Div, London, England@Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Econ, London E1 4NS, England@Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Chortareas, G@Bank of England@Queen Mary University London@University of London@University of Connecticut::Kapetanios, G@Bank of England@Queen Mary University London@University of London@University of Connecticut",not exist,"Threshold cointegration+Balke, NS; Fomby, TB+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+AUG 1997::RECURSIVE AND SEQUENTIAL-TESTS OF THE UNIT-ROOT AND TREND-BREAK HYPOTHESES - THEORY AND INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE+BANERJEE, A; LUMSDAINE, RL; STOCK, JH+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1992::Nonlinear adjustment to purchasing power parity in the post-Bretton Woods era+Baum, CF; Barkoulas, JT; Caglayan, M+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+JUN 2001::no title+BLAKE AP+J TIME SER ANAL+2001::An assessment of the evidence on purchasing power parity+Breuer, J.+Estimating Equilibrium Exchange Rates.

Hard times or great expectations?

Using a large panel of quoted UK firms, we estimate panel data probit models for the incidence of dividend omissions and cuts as functions of financial characteristics including cash flow, leverage, investment opportunities, investment and company size. These variables account for most of the increase in omission since 1995. There is relatively little evidence to link this to the major tax reform of 1997 that abolished tax refunds on dividend income payable to tax-exempt institutions.

Non-linear predictability of UK stock market returns,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2003.00061.x,DEC 2003,65,36,"Linear predictability of stock market returns has been widely reported. However, recently developed theoretical research has suggested that due to the interaction of noise and arbitrage traders, stock returns are inherently non-linear, whereby market dynamics differ between small and large returns. This paper examines whether an exponential smooth transition threshold model, which is capable of capturing this non-linear behaviour, can provide a better characterization of UK stock market returns than either a linear model or an alternate non-linear model. The results of both in-sample and out-of-sample specification tests support the exponential smooth transition threshold model and hence the belief that investor behaviour does differ between large and small returns.",,"TRANSITION AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS,ECONOMIC-SIGNIFICANCE,MOMENTUM STRATEGIES,EFFICIENT MARKET,INDEX RETURNS,EXCHANGE-RATE,RISK,PRICES,ARBITRAGE,EARNINGS","McMillan, DG@Univ Aberdeen, Dept Accountancy & Finance, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland","McMillan, DG@University of Aberdeen","McMillan, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5891-4193","Uncovering nonlinear structure in real-time stock-market indexes: The S&amp;P 500, the DAX, the Nikkei 225, and the FTSE-100+Abhyankar, A; Copeland, LS; Wong, W+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1997::PREDICTING STOCK RETURNS IN AN EFFICIENT MARKET+BALVERS, RJ; COSIMANO, TF; MCDONALD, B+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+SEP 1990::INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF COMMON-STOCKS IN RELATION TO THEIR PRICE-EARNINGS RATIOS - TEST OF EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS+BASU, S+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+1977::Stock price reactions to earnings announcements: A summary of recent anomalous evidence and possible explanations+Bernard,, Victor Lewis.+Advances in Behavioral Finance+1992::Insider and liquidity trading in stock and options markets+Biasis, B.; Hillion, P.+Review of Financial Studies+1994::Induction of pattern in neural structure by experience: implications for cognitive development+Black, J.

Human capital spillovers within the workplace: Evidence for Great Britain,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2003.00062.x,DEC 2003,35,37,"In this paper, we use a unique matched worker-workplace data set to estimate the effect on own earnings of co-workers' education. Our results, using the 1998 GB Workplace Employee Relations Survey, show significant effects. An independent, significantly positive effect from average workplace education is evident; own earnings premia from years of education fall only slightly when controlling for workplace education. This result suggests that the social returns to education are strongly positive-working with colleagues who each had 1.2 years (1 standard deviation) of more education than the average worker, boosts own earnings by 11.1%. An additional year of any single co-worker's education is worth about 3.2% of an additional own year of education. We also test for interactions between own and co-worker education levels and for 'skills incompatibility' when worker education levels are heterogeneous. The interactions appear negative: own education is not much valued at workplaces where co-workers' education levels are already high. There is no evidence that workplace heterogeneity in worker education levels adversely affects own earnings. This result runs counter to theoretical predictions, and suggests that workers compete in tournaments for high-paying jobs.",,"SIZE-WAGE PREMIUM,MATCHED DATA,PRODUCTIVITY,EARNINGS,RETURNS,GROWTH","Battu, H@Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Old Aberdeen, Scotland@Univ Aberdeen, Ctr European Labour Market Res, Old Aberdeen, Scotland@Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, New York, NY USA@Univ Coll Swansea, Dept Econ, WELMERC, Swansea, W Glam, Wales@IZA, Inst Sudy Labour, Bonn, Germany::Belfield, CR@Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Old Aberdeen, Scotland@Univ Aberdeen, Ctr European Labour Market Res, Old Aberdeen, Scotland@Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, New York, NY USA@Univ Coll Swansea, Dept Econ, WELMERC, Swansea, W Glam, Wales@IZA, Inst Sudy Labour, Bonn, Germany::Sloane, PJ@Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Old Aberdeen, Scotland@Univ Aberdeen, Ctr European Labour Market Res, Old Aberdeen, Scotland@Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, New York, NY USA@Univ Coll Swansea, Dept Econ, WELMERC, Swansea, W Glam, Wales@IZA, Inst Sudy Labour, Bonn, Germany","Battu, H@University of Aberdeen@University of Aberdeen@Columbia University@Columbia University Teachers College@Swansea University@IZA Institute Labor Economics::Belfield, CR@University of Aberdeen@University of Aberdeen@Columbia University@Columbia University Teachers College@Swansea University@IZA Institute Labor Economics::Sloane, PJ@University of Aberdeen@University of Aberdeen@Columbia University@Columbia University Teachers College@Swansea University@IZA Institute Labor Economics",not exist,"High wage workers and high wage firms+Abowd, JM; Kramarz, F; Margolis, DN+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1999::Updating the determinants of firm performance: Estimation using the 1998 UK Workplace Employee Relations Survey+Addison, JT; Belfield, CR+BRITISH JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS+SEP 2001::A Review of Estimates of the Schooling/Earnings Relationship, with Tests for Publication Bias+Ashenfelter, Orley; Harmon, Colm; Oosterbeek, Hessel.+Labour Economics+1999::How well do we measure training?+Barron, JM; Berger, MC; Black, DA+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JUL 1997::no title+BARTH E+EXTERNAL EFFECTS ED+2000::Overeducation among graduates: A cohort view+Battu, H.; Belfield, C.

Two empirical methodologies, vector error correction (VEC) modelling and second-generation random coefficient (RC) modelling, are used to estimate the demand for money. The coefficients of both the VEC and RC procedures support the hypothesis that the demand for money becomes more responsive to both the own rate of return on money balances and the opportunity cost of holding money because of financial, deregulation. In general, both procedures also support the hypothesis that the income elasticity of money demand declines over time as a result of technological improvements in the payments system and the development of money substitutes, which lead to economies of scale in holding money.",,"UNITED-STATES,COINTEGRATION,EXERCISE","Brissimis, SN@Bank Greece, Econ Res Dept, Athens 10250, Greece@US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC USA@Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus, Greece@Harokopio Univ, Athens, Greece::Hondroyiannis, G@Bank Greece, Econ Res Dept, Athens 10250, Greece@US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC USA@Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus, Greece@Harokopio Univ, Athens, Greece::Swamy, PAVB@Bank Greece, Econ Res Dept, Athens 10250, Greece@US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC USA@Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus, Greece@Harokopio Univ, Athens, Greece::Tavlas, GS@Bank Greece, Econ Res Dept, Athens 10250, Greece@US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC USA@Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus, Greece@Harokopio Univ, Athens, Greece","Brissimis, SN@Unknow@Unknow@University of Piraeus@Harokopio University Athens::Hondroyiannis, G@Unknow@Unknow@University of Piraeus@Harokopio University Athens::Swamy, PAVB@Unknow@Unknow@University of Piraeus@Harokopio University Athens::Tavlas, GS@Unknow@Unknow@University of Piraeus@Harokopio University Athens","Hondroyiannis, George@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4021-7517","no title+BORDO M+LONG RUN BEHAV VELOC+1987::THE LONG-RUN BEHAVIOR OF VELOCITY - THE INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH REVISITED+BORDO, MD; JONUNG, L+JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING+SUM 1990::A computational approach to finding causal economic laws+Chang, I.-L.; Swamy, P.A.V.B.; Hallahan, C.; et al.+Computational Economics+Oct. 2000::A general framework for predicting returns from multiple currency investments+Christou, C; Swamy, PAVB; Tavlas, GS+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+JUL 1998::SERIAL-CORRELATION AND A BANK OF ENGLAND STUDY OF DEMAND FOR MONEY - EXERCISE IN MEASUREMENT WITHOUT THEORY+COURAKIS, AS+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+1978::no title+DELLAS HG+EC B BANK GREECE+1999::no title+Doornik, J.

Exogeneity in vector error correction models with purely exogenous long-run paths,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2003.00065.x,DEC 2003,34,4,"Existing exogeneity conditions of literature are only sufficient and imply 'overly strong' constraints on long-run parameters. This paper presents some new results on exogeneity in vector error correction models. A key concept of the analysis is the 'purely exogenous long-run path', i.e. a cointegrating vector only including 'exogenous' variables. Extending earlier results of Johansen, S. (1992). 'Cointegration in partial systems and the efficiency of single-equation analysis', Journal of Econometrics, Vol. 52, pp. 389-402 and of Toda and Phillips (1991). Vector Autoregressions and Causality, Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper, No. 977 among others, we propose a framework based on two canonical representations of the long-run matrix, which can constitute a suitable basis to formulate a necessary and sufficient condition for non-causality as well as a condition for strong exogeneity. An interesting property is that the statistics involved in the sequential procedures for testing these conditions are distributed as chi(2) variables and can, therefore, easily be calculated with the usual statistical computer packages, which makes our approach fully operational, empirically. Finally, the power and size distortions of the sequential test procedures are analysed using Monte Carlo experiments.",,"COINTEGRATED SYSTEMS,AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS,UNITED-KINGDOM,REPRESENTATION,HYPOTHESES,INFERENCE,UK","Pradel, J@Univ Paris 01, EUREQua, F-75647 Paris 13, France@Dept Econ, F-91025 Evry, France::Rault, C@Univ Paris 01, EUREQua, F-75647 Paris 13, France@Dept Econ, F-91025 Evry, France","Pradel, J@heSam Universite@Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne@Unknow::Rault, C@heSam Universite@Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Anderson, T.

Cointegration vector estimation by panel DOLS and long-run money demand,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2003.00066.x,DEC 2003,25,175,"We study the panel dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) estimator of a homogeneous cointegration vector for a balanced panel of N individuals observed over T time periods. Allowable heterogeneity across individuals include individual-specific time trends, individual-specific fixed effects and time-specific effects. The estimator is fully parametric, computationally convenient, and more precise than the single equation estimator. For fixed N as T --> infinity, the estimator converges to a function of Brownian motions and the Wald statistic for testing a set of s linear constraints has a limiting chi(2)(s) distribution. The estimator also has a Gaussian sequential limit distribution that is obtained first by letting T --> infinity and then letting N --> infinity. In a series of Monte-Carlo experiments, we find that the asymptotic distribution theory provides a reasonably close approximation to the exact finite sample distribution. We use panel DOLS to estimate coefficients of the long-run money demand function from a panel of 19 countries with annual observations that span from 1957 to 1996. The estimated income elasticity is 1.08 (asymptotic s.e. = 0.26) and the estimated interest rate semi-elasticity is -0.02 (asymptotic s.e. = 0.01).",,"REGRESSION,FIRMS,TESTS","Mark, NC@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA@Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand::Sul, D@Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA@Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand","Mark, NC@Ohio State University@University of Notre Dame@National Bureau of Economic Research@University of Auckland::Sul, D@Ohio State University@University of Notre Dame@National Bureau of Economic Research@University of Auckland",not exist,"THE DEMAND FOR M1 IN THE USA, 1960-1988+BABA, Y; HENDRY, DF; STARR, RM+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JAN 1992::Inference on Factor Models of Large Dimensions+Bai, J.+Econometrica+2003::THE WELFARE COST OF INFLATIONARY FINANCE+BAILEY, MJ+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1956::no title+BALL L+J MONETARY ECON+2001::no title+FRIEDMAN M+STUDIES QUANTITY THE+1956::DEMAND FOR MONEY FROM GREAT DEPRESSION TO PRESENT+GANDOLFI, AE; LOTHIAN, JR+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1976::THE STABILITY OF LONG-RUN MONEY DEMAND IN 5 INDUSTRIAL-COUNTRIES+HOFFMAN, DL; RASCHE, RH; TIESLAU, MA+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+APR 1995::no title+Im, K.

A natural experiment on the 'race to the bottom' hypothesis: Testing for stochastic dominance in temporal pollution trends,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.t01-1-00054,SEP 2003,43,13,"Devolution of tasks to local levels of government has recently become a popular agenda item within certain political factions in the US. While one expects the local policymaker to tailor policies to match the preferences of his constituents, critics of local policymaking claim that externalities are ignored and inefficiencies thus arise under local control of certain policies. A primary example concerns the control of pollution, which is known to have adverse effects on neighbouring jurisdictions. Whether localities actually 'race to the bottom' and enact lax environmental policies when given the chance remains an open issue. In this study, we make use of sothcastic dominance tests to examine if President Reagan's policy of 'New Federalism' in the early 1980s induced states to lower environmental standards. Among the several environmental measures analysed, we do not find any evidence that the 'race to the bottom' materialized. Indeed, the evidence shows that even during these lean years of federal intervention several indicators of environmental quality at the state level continued to improve.",,"UNITED-STATES,ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATIONS,COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS,COMPETITION,US,EMISSIONS,WELFARE,POLICY,TOXICS","Millimet, DL@So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA::List, JA@So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA","Millimet, DL@Southern Methodist University::List, JA@Southern Methodist University",not exist,"Do community characteristics influence environmental outcomes?

Further evidence on PPP adjustment speeds: The case of effective real exchange rates and the EMS,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.t01-1-00055,SEP 2003,48,34,"Two different approaches intend to resolve the 'puzzling' slow convergence to purchasing power parity (PPP) reported in the literature [see Rogoff (1996), Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. 34.] On the one hand, there are models that consider a non-linear adjustment of real exchange rate to PPP induced by transaction costs. Such costs imply the presence of a certain transaction band where adjustment is too costly to be undertaken. On the other hand, there are models that relax the 'classical' PPP assumption of constant equilibrium real exchange rates. A prominent theory put together by Balassa (1964, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 72) and Samuelson (1964 Review of Economics and Statistics, Vol. 46), the BS effect, suggests that a non-constant real exchange rate equilibrium is induced by different productivity growth rates between countries. This paper reconciles those two approaches by considering an exponential smooth transition-in-deviation non-linear adjustment mechanism towards non-constant equilibrium real exchange rates within the EMS (European Monetary System) and effective rates. The equilibrium is proxied, in a theoretically appealing manner, using deterministic trends and the relative price of non-tradables to proxy for BS effects. The empirical results provide further support for the hypothesis that real exchange rates are well described by symmetric, nonlinear processes. Furthermore, the half-life of shocks in such models is found to be dramatically shorter than that obtained in linear models.",,"PURCHASING-POWER-PARITY,NONLINEAR ADJUSTMENT,LONG-RUN,MEAN-REVERSION,2 CENTURIES,EQUILIBRIUM,TESTS,SPECIFICATION,PUZZLE,MARKET","Paya, I@Univ Wales Coll Cardiff, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales::Venetis, IA@Univ Wales Coll Cardiff, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales::Peel, DA@Univ Wales Coll Cardiff, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales","Paya, I@Cardiff University::Venetis, IA@Cardiff University::Peel, DA@Cardiff University","Venetis, Ioannis@P-2959-2017::Paya, Ivan@K-4059-2012::VENETIS, IOANNIS@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6252-5353::Peel, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5281-2041","A linearity test for near-unit root time series+Acosta, FM; Granger, CW.+Discussion Paper No. 95-12+1995::Transaction costs and non-linear adjustment towards equilibrium in the US treasury bill market+Anderson, HM+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1997::The Balassa-Samuelson model: A General Equilibrium Appraisal+ASEA, P.; MENDOZA, E.+Review of International Economics+1994::THE PURCHASING-POWER PARITY DOCTRINE - A REAPPRAISAL+BALASSA, B+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1964::Nonlinear adjustment to purchasing power parity in the post-Bretton Woods era+Baum, CF; Barkoulas, JT; Caglayan, M+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+JUN 2001::Real Exchange Rate Movements and the Relative Price of Nontraded Goods+BETTS, C.

Okun's law revisited,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.t01-1-00056,SEP 2003,19,32,"In the light of modem theoretical studies, the negative relationship between output and unemployment may take a nonlinear form, in the sense that changes in output can cause asymmetric changes in the unemployment rate. A regime-dependent specification of Okun's law, where the inverse relationship between cyclical unemployment and cyclical GDP is allowed to differ across recessions and expansions, is estimated for the US economy. Using both the Hodfick-Prescott filter and a bivariate structural time series model to isolate the cyclical component of the variables of interest, the nonlinear specification is highly significant when tested against the linear alternative independently of the method used for extracting the cycle of unemployment and GDP. The estimation results imply that the contemporaneous effect of growth on unemployment is asymmetric and significantly higher in recessions than in expansions, and shocks to unemployment tend to be more persistent in the expansionary regime.",,"BUSINESS-CYCLE,UNEMPLOYMENT,COEFFICIENT","Cuaresma, JC@Univ Vienna, Dept Econ, A-1210 Vienna, Austria","Cuaresma, JC@University of Vienna",not exist,"ASYMMETRIES IN THE CYCLICAL BEHAVIOR OF UK LABOR-MARKETS+ACEMOGLU, D; SCOTT, A+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+NOV 1994::Okun's law, cointegration and gap variables+Attfield, CLF; Silverstone, B+JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS+SUM 1998::Asymmetry and duration dependence in Australian GDP and unemployment+Bodman, PM+ECONOMIC RECORD+DEC 1998::DURATION-DEPENDENT TRANSITIONS IN A MARKOV MODEL OF UNITED-STATES GNP GROWTH+DURLAND, JM; MCCURDY, TH+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1994::Shirking, unemployment and aggregate fluctuations+Gomme, P+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+FEB 1999::no title+HAHN F+EC SERIES+1996::Inference when a nuisance parameter is not identified under the null hypothesis+Hansen, BE+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1996::no title+Harvey, A.

Finite-sample critical values of the new tests are computed and Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to examine the size and the power properties of the tests in finite samples.

Ricardian Equivalence is rejected however, since we cannot reject a relatively short planning horizon or a precautionary savings motive for the consumers.

The value of secondary school quality,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.t01-1-00053,JUL 2003,37,26,"improving the quality of state-funded secondary school education has become a major policy aim in the UK. However, without a valuation of the social benefits derived from public provision of educational services, the rational evaluation of policy to this end is difficult. Utilizing the argument that dwellings near better schools command a price premium, this paper presents results from an empirical exercise aimed at providing such a social valuation of increased school quality. Using a large set of data for England, and an instrumental variable approach, results indicate an elasticity of dwelling purchase price with respect to exam performance by schools at around +0.05. One implication is that society would value a general increase of five percentage points in exam performance by about pound450 million per annum.",,"RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY-VALUES,HOUSING VALUES,EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION,PRICES,CAPITALIZATION,CHURCHES","Rosenthal, L@Keele Univ, Dept Econ, Keele, Staffs, England","Rosenthal, L@Keele University",not exist,"Do better schools matter?

The effects of consumption variability on saving: Evidence from a panel of Muscovite households,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.t01-1-00049,JUL 2003,49,13,"Due to the high uncertainty characterizing them, transition economies provide an extraordinary opportunity to test the precautionary saving hypothesis. This paper represents an attempt to exploit this opportunity. We use a panel of 2,346 Muscovite households, over the 12 months of 1996, to construct two time-varying measures of consumption growth variability, which we use as proxies for households' perceived uncertainty. We then regress household saving on these uncertainty variables using a GMM-system estimator. We find that both uncertainty measures generally have a positive and statistically significant effect on saving. This result, which is robust to the use of different measures of saving, supports the precautionary saving hypothesis.",,"PERMANENT-INCOME HYPOTHESIS,LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS,EARNINGS UNCERTAINTY,TRANSITORY INCOME,RUSSIA,BEHAVIOR,GROWTH,MODELS","Guariglia, A@Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Dept Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England@Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England::Kim, BY@Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Dept Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England@Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England","Guariglia, A@University of Kent@University of Essex::Kim, BY@University of Kent@University of Essex",not exist,"ANOTHER LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+ARELLANO, M; BOVER, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::no title+ARELLANO M+UNPUB DYNAMIC PANEL+1998::Risk pooling, precautionary saving and consumption growth+Banks, J; Blundell, R; Brugiavini, A+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+OCT 2001::Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models+Blundell, R; Bond, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1998::Savings, investment, and growth in Eastern Europe+Borensztein, E.; Montiel, P.+IMF Working Paper, 91/61+1991::Winners and losers in Russia's economic transition+Brainerd, E+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1998::Household saving: Micro theories and micro facts+Browning, M; Lusardi, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+DEC 1996::no title+CARROLL C+199915 FED RES BOARD+1999::The nature of precautionary wealth+Carroll, CD; Samwick, AA+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+SEP 1997::How important is precautionary saving?+Carroll, CD; Samwick, AA+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1998::no title+CHERNYISHEVA T+VOPROSY STATISTIKI+1997::no title+CONWAY P+1509 WORLD BANK+1995::no title+*CTR EC AN+EK KON+1997::no title+DENIZER C+6457 NAT BUR EC+1998::no title+DENIZER C+UNPUB AGGREGATE SAVI+1998::HOW PRUDENT ARE CONSUMERS+DYNAN, KE+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+DEC 1993::no title+no author+Transition Report 1999+1999::THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONSUMPTION TO CHANGING EXPECTATIONS ABOUT FUTURE INCOME+FLAVIN, MA+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1981::no title+FOMINSKAYA N+VOPROSY STAT+1998::no title+Friedman, M.+A Theory of the Consumption Function+1957::no title+*GOSKOMSTAT+STAT B+1999::Do the Russians really save that much?

Does tax evasion affect occupational choice?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.t01-1-00050,JUL 2003,41,32,"This paper presents a novel micro-econometric procedure that identifies the extent to which occupational choices are distorted by opportunities for tax evasion. Previous studies claim to have found significant and substantial effects, but analysis and replication of their methods reveals that they generate conflicting and misleading results. The paper then implements the new procedure using several British micro-data sets. A thorough empirical investigation reveals that occupational choice between self-employment and paid employment is not robustly related to pecuniary factors in general, and is invariant to tax avoidance and evasion opportunities in particular.",,"SELF-EMPLOYMENT,RISK-TAKING,INCOME TAXATION,UNITED-STATES,ENTRY,UNEMPLOYMENT,POLICY,MODELS","Parker, SC@Univ Durham, Sch Econ Finance & Business, Durham, England","Parker, SC@Durham University",not exist,"no title+Aronson, R.

The student-level estimations show that international differences in student performance cannot be attributed to resource differences but are considerably related to institutional differences. Among the many institutions which combine to yield major positive effects on student performance are centralized examinations and control mechanisms, school autonomy in personnel and process decisions, individual teacher influence over teaching methods, limits to teacher unions' influence on curriculum scope, scrutiny of students' achievement and competition from private schools.",,"CLASS SIZE,ACHIEVEMENT,COUNTRIES,QUALITY,GROWTH","Wossmann, L@CESIFO, Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany","Wossmann, L@Ifo Institut",not exist,"DOES CLASS SIZE MATTER+AKERHIELM, K+ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW+SEP 1995::Using Maimonides' rule to estimate the effect of class size on scholastic achievement+Angrist, JD; Lavy, V+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1999::Human capital and growth+Barro, RJ+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2001::no title+Beaton, AE; Martin, MO; Mullis, IVS<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Gonzalez, EJ; Smith, TA; Kelly, DL</span>.+Science Achievement in Middle School Years: IEA's Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)+1996::The effect of national standards and curriculum-based exams on achievement+Bishop, JH+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1997::no title+BISHOP JH+IN PRESS ED EC   NOV+2001::no title+BRYK AS+ADV QUANTITATIVE TEC+1992::School inputs and educational outcomes in South Africa+Case, A; Deaton, A+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1999::no title+COHEN J+EVALUATION RELATIVE+1998::no title+Deaton, Angus.+The Analysis of Household Surveys : A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy+1997::USING SAMPLE SURVEY WEIGHTS IN MULTIPLE-REGRESSION ANALYSES OF STRATIFIED SAMPLES+DUMOUCHEL, WH; DUNCAN, GJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::no title+Goldstein, H.+Multilevel statistical models+1999::no title+no author+User Guide for the TIMSS International Database: Primary and Middle School Years+1997::The decline of schooling productivity in OECD countries+Gundlach, E; Wossmann, L; Gmelin, J+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAY 2001::The fading productivity of schooling in East Asia+GUNDLACH, E.; WOESSMANN, L.+Journal of Asian Economics+2001::Schooling, labor-force quality, and the growth of nations+Hanushek, EA; Kimko, DD+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2000::THE ECONOMICS OF SCHOOLING - PRODUCTION AND EFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC-SCHOOLS+HANUSHEK, EA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+SEP 1986::INTERPRETING RECENT RESEARCH ON SCHOOLING IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES+HANUSHEK, EA+WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER+AUG 1995::School Resources and Student Performance+Hanushek, Eric A.+Does Money Matter?

Convexity and sheepskin effects in the human capital earnings function: Recent evidence for Filipino men,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00042,MAY 2003,37,16,"The issue of possible non-linearities in the relationship between log wages and schooling has received a good deal of attention in the literature. This paper uses data from a recent, high quality household survey for the Philippines, the 1998 Annual Poverty Indicator Survey (APIS), to test the fit of the log-linear specification for Filipino men. The results are based on a number of estimation strategies, including spline regressions, and semi-parametric regressions with a large number of dummies for years of schooling and experience. The basic conclusions of the paper are two. First, there appear to be large differences between the rates of return to education across levels in the Philippines. In particular, the returns to both primary and secondary education are lower than those for tertiary education, a difference which persists even after correcting for differences in direct private costs across levels. Second, within a given level, the last year of schooling is disproportionately rewarded in terms of higher wages. That is, there are clear sheepskin effects associated with graduation from primary school, secondary school, and university.",,"EDUCATION,RETURNS,MARKET,RATES,INVESTMENT,SELECTION,COHORT,FAMILY","Schady, NR@World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA","Schady, NR@The World Bank",not exist,"Race and gender in the labour market+Altonji, J.

Disaggregate wealth and aggregate consumption: An investigation of empirical relationships for the G7,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00044,MAY 2003,27,14,"To date, studies of wealth effects on consumption have mainly used aggregate wealth definitions on a single-country basis. This study seeks to break new ground by analysing disaggregated financial wealth in consumption functions for G7 countries. Contrary to earlier empirical work, we find that illiquid financial wealth (i.e. securities, pensions and mortgage debt) tends to be a more important long-run determinant of consumption than liquid financial wealth. These results imply potential instability in consumption functions employing aggregate wealth. Our results are robust using SURE; when testing with a nested specification; and when using a linear model.",,"STOCK-MARKET WEALTH,TESTS","Byrne, JP@Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London SW1P 3HE, England@Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England::Davis, EP@Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London SW1P 3HE, England@Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England","Byrne, JP@Unknow@Brunel University::Davis, EP@Unknow@Brunel University","Byrne, Joseph@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0623-0398","THE LIFE-CYCLE HYPOTHESIS OF SAVING - AGGREGATE IMPLICATIONS AND TESTS+ANDO, A; MODIGLIANI, F+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1963::no title+Banerjee, A.; Dolado, J.

Fractional integration and the dynamics of UK unemployment,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.t01-1-00047,MAY 2003,25,23,"This article is concerned with estimating the dynamic behaviour of UK unemployment using fractional integration methods. The question it considers is whether an unemployment model using a relatively small set of determinants of unemployment is consistent with the persistence which estimates an integrated model yield, or the much long-lasting estimates obtained from fractional integration. Our empirical tests favour the latter version. The results show that when accounting for UK unemployment in terms of lagged values of the real oil price and the real interest rate, unemployment appears fractionally integrated. This finding means that although unemployment is mean reverting, once it is shocked it may take a very long time to recover, and our estimates of the response times are considerably in excess of those previously reported in the literature.",,"MACROECONOMIC TIME-SERIES,NONSTATIONARY HYPOTHESES,MODELS","Gil-Alana, LA@Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain@Univ Oxford, Ctr Int Macroecon, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UL, England::Henry, SGB@Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain@Univ Oxford, Ctr Int Macroecon, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UL, England","Gil-Alana, LA@University of Navarra@University of Oxford::Henry, SGB@University of Navarra@University of Oxford",not exist,"no title+BANERJEE A+EQUILIBRIUM ERROR CO+1993::no title+BEAN C+321 LOND SCH EC CTR+1988::EUROPEAN UNEMPLOYMENT - A SURVEY+BEAN, CR+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+JUN 1994::no title+BLANCHARD O+NBER WORKING PAPER+1999::Unemployment equilibria and input prices: Theory and evidence from the United States+Carruth, AA; Hooker, MA; Oswald, AJ+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1998::Testing fractional integration with monthly data+Gil-Alana, LA+ECONOMIC MODELLING+DEC 1999::Mean reversion in the real exchange rates+Gil-Alana, LA+ECONOMICS LETTERS+DEC 2000::Testing of seasonal fractional integration in UK and Japanese consumption and income+Gil-Alana, LA; Robinson, PM+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+MAR-APR 2001::Testing stochastic cycles in macroeconomic time series+Gil-Alana, LA+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+JUL 2001::Testing of unit root and other nonstationary hypotheses in macroeconomic time series+GilAlana, LA; Robinson, PM+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 1997::An introduction to long-memory time series models and fractional differencing+Granger, C.W.J.; Joyeux, R.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1980::SOME PROPERTIES OF TIME-SERIES DATA AND THEIR USE IN ECONOMETRIC-MODEL SPECIFICATION+GRANGER, CWJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1981::LONG MEMORY RELATIONSHIPS AND THE AGGREGATION OF DYNAMIC-MODELS+GRANGER, CWJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1980::Unemployment dynamics and the natural rate: an introduction+Henry, B; Nickell, S; Snower, DJ+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 2000::MODELING PERSISTENCE IN HYDROLOGICAL TIME-SERIES USING FRACTIONAL DIFFERENCING+HOSKING, JRM+WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH+1984::no title+Layard, R.; Nickell, S.; Jackman, R.+Unemployment: Macroeconomic Performance and the Labour Market+1991::no title+MINFORD P+SWEDISH EC POLICY RE+1994::Unemployment: Questions and some answers+Nickell, S+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAY 1998::Unemployment and labor market rigidities: Europe versus North America+Nickell, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+SUM 1997::What is fractional integration?+Parke, WR+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1999::no title+Phelps, E.

The demand for health care services in rural Tanzania,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.t01-2-00046,MAY 2003,22,49,"This paper examines the pattern of health care demand in rural Tanzania. We distinguish between hospital and clinic-based care, in both the public and private sector using a two-level nested multinomial logit model. Own price elasticities of demand for all health care options are high, although less so for public clinics and dispensaries than other choices. However, there is a high degree of substitution between public and private care. Consequently, price increases or user fees will result in small percentage of people opting for self-treatment. Another important contribution of this paper is that the quality of medical care has large effects on health demand. This applies to the quality and availability of doctors/nurses, drugs and the clinic environment.",,"MEDICAL-CARE,QUALITY,CHOICE,KENYA","Sahn, DE@Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA@Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA::Younger, SD@Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA@Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA::Genicot, G@Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA@Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA","Sahn, DE@Cornell University@University of California Irvine@University of California System::Younger, SD@Cornell University@University of California Irvine@University of California System::Genicot, G@Cornell University@University of California Irvine@University of California System",not exist,"The impact of the increase in user fees: a preliminary investigation+Bennett, S.+Lesotho Epidemiological Bulletin+1989::NON-PRICE RATIONING AND THE CHOICE OF MEDICAL-CARE PROVIDERS IN RURAL COTE-DIVOIRE+DOR, A; GERTLER, P; VANDERGAAG, J+JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS+DEC 1987::Exploding the myth: Do all quality management practices contribute to superior quality performance?+Dow, D; Samson, D; Ford, S+PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT+SPR 1999::no title+DOW W+LABOR POPULATION PRO+1995::ARE USER FEES REGRESSIVE - THE WELFARE IMPLICATIONS OF HEALTH-CARE FINANCING PROPOSALS IN PERU+GERTLER, P; LOCAY, L; SANDERSON, W+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP-OCT 1987::no title+Gertler, Paul; Molyneaux, Jack.+Experimental evidence on the effect of raising user fees for publicly delivered health care services: Utilization health outcomes, and private provider response+1997::no title+Gertler, Paul; van der Gaag, Jaques.+The willingness to pay for medical care: Evidence from two developing countries+1990::Education and health services in Madagascar: Utilization patterns and demand determinants+Glick, P.; Razafindravonona, J.; Randretsa, I.+Cornell Food and Nutrition Policy Program Working Paper No. 107+2000::no title+GROSH ME+120 WORLD BANK+1995::no title+Kahenya,, G.; Lake,, S.+User fees and their impact on utilization of key health services+1994::no title+LAMBERT S+ED HLTH EXPENDITURE+2002::Willingness to Pay for the Quality and Intensity of Medical Care: Low Income Households in Ghana+Lavy, V.; Quigley, J.

Are returns to schooling concentrated among the most able?

I find evidence of nonlinearities in these relationships that vary across levels of schooling, and argue that ability-sorting into higher education creates problems for accurately identifying the return to schooling over the entire ability support. Over an ability support that is ""common"" to those with and without a college education, I find that the college log wage premium is incerasing for the more able, and this premium grew during the period 1984-1994 for individuals at all points in the ability distribution. The growth of this wage premium over time also appears to have followed a ""smoother"" linear path for high-ability individuals than individuals of lower ability.",,"ECONOMETRIC PROBLEMS,UNOBSERVED ABILITY,ECONOMIC RETURN,EDUCATION,REGRESSION,COLLEGE,WAGES,SELECTION,QUALITY,SAMPLE","Tobias, JL@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Tobias, JL@University of California Irvine@University of California System",not exist,"SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF CENSORED SELECTION MODELS WITH A NONPARAMETRIC SELECTION MECHANISM+AHN, H; POWELL, JL+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1993::Using siblings to estimate the effect of school quality on wages+Altonji, JG; Dunn, TA+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1996::DOES COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AFFECT SCHOOLING AND EARNINGS+ANGRIST, JD; KRUEGER, AB+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 1991::ESTIMATES OF THE ECONOMIC RETURN TO SCHOOLING FROM A NEW SAMPLE OF TWINS+ASHENFELTER, O; KRUEGER, A+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1994::Income, schooling, and ability: Evidence from a new sample of identical twins+Ashenfelter, O; Rouse, C+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 1998::GRADUATE EDUCATION, ABILITY, AND EARNINGS+ASHENFELTER, O; MOONEY, JD+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+1968::College choice and wages: Estimates using data on female twins+Behrman, JR; Rosenzweig, MR; Taubman, P+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1996::SHEEPSKIN EFFECTS IN THE RETURNS TO EDUCATION - AN EXAMINATION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES+BELMAN, D; HEYWOOD, JS+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1991::UNOBSERVED ABILITY, EFFICIENCY WAGES, AND INTERINDUSTRY WAGE DIFFERENTIALS+BLACKBURN, M; NEUMARK, D+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 1992::OMITTED-ABILITY BIAS AND THE INCREASE IN THE RETURN TO SCHOOLING+BLACKBURN, ML; NEUMARK, D+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JUL 1993::ARE OLS ESTIMATES OF THE RETURN TO SCHOOLING BIASED DOWNWARD - ANOTHER LOOK+BLACKBURN, ML; NEUMARK, D+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 1995::Kernel regression in empirical microeconomics+Blundell, R; Duncan, A+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+WIN 1998::Using Geographic Variation in College Proximity to Estimate the Return to Schooling+Card, D.+Aspects of Labour Market Behavior: Essays in Honour of John Vanderkamp+1995::Estimating the return to schooling: Progress on some persistent econometric problems+Card, D+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2001::DOES SCHOOL QUALITY MATTER - RETURNS TO EDUCATION AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLIC-SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED-STATES+CARD, D; KRUEGER, AB+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+FEB 1992::no title+Card, D.+The causal effect of education on earnings+1999::Three observations on wages and measured cognitive ability+Cawley, J; Heckman, J; Vytlacil, E+LABOUR ECONOMICS+SEP 2001::On policies to reward the value added by educators+Cawley, J; Heckman, J; Vytlacil, E+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1999::no title+CAWLEY J+STAT SOC SCI PUBL P+1997::no title+CONNEELY K+UNPUB ESTIMATING HET+1997::Nonparametric density and regression estimation+DiNardo, J; Tobias, JL+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+FAL 2001::no title+FAN J+LOCALPOLYNOMIAL MODE+1996::ESTIMATING RETURNS TO SCHOOLING - SOME ECONOMETRIC PROBLEMS+GRILICHES, Z+ECONOMETRICA+1977::Education income and ability+Griliches, Z.; Mason, W.M.+Journal of Political Economy+1972::CHANGES IN COLLEGE SKILLS AND THE RISE IN THE COLLEGE WAGE PREMIUM+GROGGER, J; EIDE, E+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SPR 1995::SCHOOLING AND EARNINGS OF LOW ACHIEVERS+HANSEN, WL; WEISBROD, BA; SCANLON, WJ+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1970::no title+Hardle, W.+Applied Nonparametric Regression+1990::Estimates of the economic return to schooling for the United Kingdom+Harmon, C; Walker, I+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1995::The marginal and average returns to schooling in the UK+Harmon, C; Walker, I+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+APR 1999::no title+HARMON C+IN PRESS J EC SURVEY+2003::no title+HECKMAN J+50 YEARS MINCER EARN+2001::Characterizing selection bias using experimental data+Heckman, J; Ichimura, H; Smith, J; et al.+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 1998::no title+HECKMAN J+IN PRESS REV EC STAT+2003::Identifying the role of cognitive ability in explaining the level of and change in the return to schooling+Heckman, J; Vytlacil, E+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2001::Four Parameters of Interest in the Evaluation of Social Programs+Heckman, J.

We allow both the composition of the inflow and individual duration dependence to vary over the business cycle. We find the inflow composition to be strongly countercyclical. Individual exit rates are found to be substatntially more sensitive to the business cycle than previously thought and than the average exit rate fluctuations suggest. Cyclical variations in duration dependence are not significant.

With our estimates, fluctuations in the average exit rate out of the first year of unemployment are mainly accounted for by variations of individual exit rates, variation of inflow composition, and variation in the inflow level combined with the duration dependence phenomenon.",,DYNAMICS,"Turon, H@Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England","Turon, H@University of Bristol",not exist,"no title+ABBRING J+IN PRESS EUROPEAN EC+2002::Business cycles and compositional variation in US unemployment+Abbring, JH; van den Berg, GJ; van Ours, JC+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 2001::UNEMPLOYMENT DURATION - COMPOSITIONAL EFFECTS AND CYCLICAL VARIABILITY+BAKER, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 1992::RANKING, UNEMPLOYMENT DURATION, AND WAGES+BLANCHARD, OJ; DIAMOND, P+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1994::no title+DARBY M+NBER WORKING PAPER+1986::no title+Devine, T.; Kiefer, N.+Empirical labor economics+1991::TRUE AND SPURIOUS DURATION DEPENDENCE - THE IDENTIFIABILITY OF THE PROPORTIONAL HAZARD MODEL+ELBERS, C; RIDDER, G+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+1982::DOES LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT REDUCE A PERSONS CHANCE OF A JOB - A TIME-SERIES TEST+JACKMAN, R; LAYARD, R+ECONOMICA+FEB 1991::no title+KALWIJ A+369 IZA+2001::no title+Lancaster, T.+The econometric analysis of transition data+1990::no title+Layard, R.

"Profit margins, adjustment costs and the business cycle: An application to Spanish manufacturing firms",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00041,FEB 2003,24,3,"The objective of this paper is to investigate the cyclical behaviour of markups, using a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1990-1998. Margins are estimated from the optimal conditions derived from the firm's optimisation problem, which assumes that labour inputs are subject to adjustment costs. A number of results emerge from the estimations. First, we find positive and asymmetric adjustment costs for permanent labour inputs. Second, price-cost margins are markedly procyclical. Our estimates suggest that labour adjustment costs more than double the variability of average margins With respect to Lerner indexes. Third, we find differences in the parameters of the adjustment technology across industries which make markups of intermediate and production good industries more cyclical than consumer good industries.

This paper considers two possible explanations for this large difference. First, we assess the likely inflation risk premium by calibrating a model of optimal bond prices under uncertainty. Employing either of CRRA or Abel (1990) relative consumption utility function to derive the stochastic discount factor and covariation risk, we suggest that the inflation risk component of this excess return is unlikely to be much above 50 bp. Secondly, we find little evidence that these excess returns can be ascribed to consistent expectational errors in predicting inflation.",,"INTEREST-RATES,TERM STRUCTURE,REAL RATES,INFLATION,PRICES,RISK","Breedon, F@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London, England@Univ Cambridge Clare Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TL, England@Lehman Bros, London, England::Chadha, JS@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London, England@Univ Cambridge Clare Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TL, England@Lehman Bros, London, England","Breedon, F@Imperial College London@University of Cambridge@Unknow::Chadha, JS@Imperial College London@University of Cambridge@Unknow","Chadha, Jagjit@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7549-9027","ASSET PRICES UNDER HABIT FORMATION AND CATCHING UP WITH THE JONESES+ABEL, AB+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1990::Inflation, real interest rates, and the bond market: A study of UK nominal and index-linked government bond prices+Barr, DG; Campbell, JY+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+AUG 1997::no title+BARRO RJ+NBER WORKING PAPER+1997::REAL AND NOMINAL INTEREST-RATES UNDER UNCERTAINTY - THE FISHER THEOREM AND THE TERM STRUCTURE+BENNINGA, S; PROTOPAPADAKIS, A+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1983::no title+BREEDON F+BANKING ENGLAND WORK+1997::no title+BROWN ET+INFLATION RISK PREMI+1998::no title+BURRELL A+2094 LOND BUS SCH CT+1994::A scorecard for indexed government debt+Campbell, J.; Shiller, R.+NBER Macroeconomics Annual+1996::no title+CAMPBELL JY+NBER WORKING PAPER+2000::no title+CAMPBELL JY+NBER WORKING PAPER+1999::A long view of real rates+Chadha, JS; Dimsdale, NH+OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY+SUM 1999::no title+COCHRANE JH+NBER WORKING PAPER+1999::Real rates, expected inflation, and inflation risk premia+Evans, MDD+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+FEB 1998::no title+FINKELSTEIN A+NBER WORKING PAPER+1999::NEW HOPE FOR THE EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS OF THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST-RATES+FROOT, KA+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUN 1989::no title+GASKE ME+9123 FRBNY+1991::Portfolio choice in the presence of background risk+Heaton, J; Lucas, D+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JAN 2000::The equity premium: It's still a puzzle+Kocherlakota, NR+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+MAR 1996::THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST-RATES OVER THE BUSINESS-CYCLE+LABADIE, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+MAY-JUL 1994::no title+*LOND BUS SCH+EC OUTL+1982::Interest rates and currency prices in a two-country world+Lucas, R.

Test procedures for unit roots in time series with level shifts at unknown time,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00036,FEB 2003,20,39,Two types of unit root tests which accommodate a structural level shift at a known point in time are extended to the situation where the break date is unknown. It is shown that for any estimator for the break date the tests have the same asymptotic distribution as the corresponding tests under the known. break date assumption. Different estimators of the break date are compared in a Monte Carlo experiment and a recommendation for-choosing the break date in small samples is given. Example series from the Nelson-Plosser data set are used to illustrate the performance of our tests.,,"OIL-PRICE SHOCK,GREAT CRASH,HYPOTHESIS,BREAK","Lanne, M@Univ Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland@Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany@European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy::Lutkepohl, H@Univ Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland@Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany@European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy::Saikkonen, P@Univ Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland@Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany@European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy","Lanne, M@University of Helsinki@Humboldt University of Berlin@European University Institute::Lutkepohl, H@University of Helsinki@Humboldt University of Berlin@European University Institute::Saikkonen, P@University of Helsinki@Humboldt University of Berlin@European University Institute","Lanne, Markku@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9397-2578","AN LM TEST FOR A UNIT-ROOT IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRUCTURAL-CHANGE+AMSLER, C; LEE, JS+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 1995::RECURSIVE AND SEQUENTIAL-TESTS OF THE UNIT-ROOT AND TREND-BREAK HYPOTHESES - THEORY AND INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE+BANERJEE, A; LUMSDAINE, RL; STOCK, JH+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1992::SEARCHING FOR A BREAK IN GNP+CHRISTIANO, LJ+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1992::Efficient tests for an autoregressive unit root+Elliott, G; Rothenberg, TJ; Stock, JH+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1996::OUTPUT AND UNEMPLOYMENT DYNAMICS IN THE UNITED-STATES - 1950-1985+EVANS, GW+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JUL-SEP 1989::no title+Fuller, W.

Most seem to generalize fairly easy, such as the concepts of breaks, seasonality, trends and regime switching. Forecasting is more difficult, as forecasts become distributions, as do forecast errors. Persistence can be defined and also common factors by using the idea of a copula. Aggregation is more difficult but causality and controllability can be defined. The study of the time series of quantiles becomes more relevant.",,,"Granger, CWJ@Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Granger, CWJ@University of California System@University of California San Diego",not exist,"no title+Davidson, J.+Econometric theory+2000::EXOGENEITY+ENGLE, RF; HENDRY, DF; RICHARD, JF+ECONOMETRICA+1983::no title+Franses, P.

These formal tests are constructed as tests of model consistency and of both parametric and non-parametric encompassing. The formal tests are then combined with informal tests using simulation in combination with non-parametric density and conditional mean estimation. The informal tests are shown to be useful in shedding light on the failure (or success) of the encompassing tests.

Selecting a nonlinear time series model using weighted tests of equal forecast accuracy,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,NO DOI,2003,31,27,"Nonlinear time series models have become fashionable tools to describe and forecast a variety of economic time series. A closer look at reported empirical studies, however, reveals that these models apparently fit well in-sample, but rarely show a substantial improvement in out-of-sample forecasts, at least over linear models. One of the many possible reasons for this finding is the use of inappropriate model selection criteria and forecast evaluation criteria. In this paper we therefore propose a novel criterion, which we believe does more justice to the very nature of nonlinear models. Simulations show that this criterion outperforms those criteria currently in use, in the sense that the true nonlinear model is more often found to perform better in out-of-sample forecasting than a benchmark linear model. An empirical illustration for US GDP emphasizes its relevance.",,"PREDICTIVE ABILITY,DENSITY FORECASTS,INFERENCE","van Dijk, D@Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands::Franses, PH@Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","van Dijk, D@Erasmus University Rotterdam::Franses, PH@Erasmus University Rotterdam","van Dijk, Dick@C-3542-2012::Franses, Philip Hans@D-4398-2009","Testing density forecasts, with applications to risk management+Berkowitz, J+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 2001::Evaluating interval forecasts+Christoffersen, PF+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 1998::Tests of equal forecast accuracy and encompassing for nested models+Clark, TE; McCracken, MW+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2001::Finite-sample properties of tests for equal forecast accuracy+Clark, TE+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+DEC 1999::A Monte Carlo study of the forecasting performance of empirical SETAR models+Clements, M.

Searching for the causal structure of a vector autoregression,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1046/j.0305-9049.2003.00087.x,2003,34,77,"We provide an accessible introduction to graph-theoretic methods for causal analysis. Building on the work of Swanson and Granger (Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 92, pp. 357-367, 1997), and generalizing to a larger class of models, we show how to apply graph-theoretic methods to selecting the causal order for a structural vector autoregression (SVAR). We evaluate the PC (causal search) algorithm in a Monte Carlo study. The PC algorithm uses tests of conditional independence to select among the possible causal orders - or at least to reduce the admissible causal orders to a narrow equivalence class.

General-to-specific model selection procedures for structural vector autoregressions,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1046/j.0305-9049.2003.00088.x,2003,26,18,"Structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models have emerged as a dominant research strategy in empirical macroeconomics, but suffer from the large number of parameters employed and the resulting estimation uncertainty associated with their impulse responses. In this paper, we propose general-to-specific (Gets) model selection procedures to overcome these limitations. It is shown that single-equation procedures are generally efficient for the reduction of recursive SVAR models. The small-sample properties of the proposed reduction procedure (as implemented using PcGets) are evaluated in a realistic Monte Carlo experiment. The impulse responses generated by the selected SVAR are found to be more precise and accurate than those of the unrestricted VAR. The proposed reduction strategy is then applied to the US monetary system considered by Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (Review of Economics and Statistics, Vol. 78, pp. 16-34, 1996). The results are consistent with the Monte Carlo and question the validity of the impulse responses generated by the full system.",,"MONETARY-POLICY,FUNDS","Krolzig, HM@Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England@Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England","Krolzig, HM@University of Oxford@University of Oxford",not exist,"THE FEDERAL-FUNDS RATE AND THE CHANNELS OF MONETARY TRANSMISSION+BERNANKE, BS; BLINDER, AS+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1992::no title+BRUGGEMANN R+ECONOMETRIC STUDIES+2000::Comparison of model reduction methods for VAR processes+Bruggemann, R.; Krolzig, H.-M.; Lutkepohl, H.+Nuffield College Economics Working Paper, 2003-W13+2003::The effects of monetary policy shocks: Evidence from the flow of funds+Christiano, LJ; Eichenbaum, M; Evans, C+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1996::no title+DEMIRALP S+SEARCHING CAUSAL STR+2002::A structural VAR model of the Australian economy+Dungey, M; Pagan, A+ECONOMIC RECORD+DEC 2000::no title+FLASCHEL P+2003W 16 NUFF COLL+2003::no title+Hall, P.+The Bootstrap and Edgeworth Expansion+1992::no title+Hendry,, D.F.; Krolzig, H.M.+Automatic Econometric Model Selection Using PcGets+2001::no title+Hendry, D.

Choosing the best volatility models: The model confidence set approach,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1046/j.0305-9049.2003.00086.x,2003,40,56,"This paper applies the model confidence set (MCS) procedure of Hansen, Lunde and Nason (2003) to a set of volatility models. An MCS is analogous to the confidence interval of a parameter in the sense that it contains the best forecasting model with a certain probability. The key to the MCS is that it acknowledges the limitations of the information in the data. The empirical exercise is based on 55 volatility models and the MCS includes about a third of these when evaluated by mean square error, whereas the MCS contains only a VGARCH model when mean absolute deviation criterion is used. We conduct a simulation study which shows that the MCS captures the superior models across a range of significance levels.

An introduction to best empirical models when the parameter space is infinite dimensional,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1046/j.0305-9049.2003.00089.x,2003,15,1,"Ploberger and Phillips (Econometrica, Vol. 71, pp. 627-673, 2003) proved a result that provides a bound on how close a fitted empirical model can get to the true model when the model is represented by a parameterized probability measure on a finite dimensional parameter space. The present note extends that result to cases where the parameter space is infinite dimensional. The results have implications for model choice in infinite dimensional problems and highlight some of the difficulties, including technical difficulties, presented by models of infinite dimension. Some implications for forecasting are considered and some applications are given, including the empirically relevant case of vector autoregression (VAR) models of infinite order.",,STOCHASTIC COMPLEXITY,"Ploberger, W@Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA@Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA@Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand@Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England::Phillips, PCB@Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA@Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA@Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand@Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Ploberger, W@University of Rochester@Yale University@University of Auckland@University of York - UK::Phillips, PCB@University of Rochester@Yale University@University of Auckland@University of York - UK","PHILLIPS, Peter Charles Bonest@D-1444-2009","no title+BLUME L+UNPUB IF YOURE SO SM+2001::no title+COVER T+ELEMENTS INFORMATION+1991::STATISTICAL-THEORY - THE PREQUENTIAL APPROACH+DAWID, AP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1984::Forecasting and conditional projections using realistic prior distributions+Doan, TA; Litterman, RB; Sims, CA.+Econ Rev+1984::no title+GERENCSER L+NEW DIRECTIONS TIME+1992::no title+KEUZENKAMP HA+SIMPLICITY INFERENCE+2001::no title+Lang, S.+Real and Functional Analysis+1993::no title+Le Cam,, L.; Yang, G.

Exact skewness-kurtosis tests for multivariate normality and goodness-of-fit in multivariate regressions with application to asset pricing models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1046/j.0305-9049.2003.00085.x,2003,32,21,"We study the problem of testing the error distribution in a multivariate linear regression (MLR) model. The tests are functions of appropriately standardized multivariate least squares residuals whose distribution is invariant to the unknown cross-equation error covariance matrix. Empirical multivariate skewness and kurtosis criteria are then compared with a simulation-based estimate of their expected value under the hypothesized distribution. Special cases considered include testing multivariate normal and stable error distributions. In the Gaussian case, finite-sample versions of the standard multivariate skewness and kurtosis tests are derived. To do this, we exploit simple, double and multi-stage Monte Carlo test methods. For non-Gaussian distribution families involving nuisance parameters, confidence sets are derived for the nuisance parameters and the error distribution. The tests are applied to an asset pricing model with observable risk-free rates, using monthly returns on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) portfolios over 5-year subperiods from 1926 to 1995.",,,"Dufour, JM@Univ Montreal, Ctr Interuniv Rech Anal Organ, CIRANO, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@Univ Montreal, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@Univ Laval, CIREQ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Univ Laval, GREEN, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Univ Laval, CIRANO, Dept Finance & Assurance, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada::Khalaf, L@Univ Montreal, Ctr Interuniv Rech Anal Organ, CIRANO, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@Univ Montreal, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@Univ Laval, CIREQ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Univ Laval, GREEN, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Univ Laval, CIRANO, Dept Finance & Assurance, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada::Beaulieu, MC@Univ Montreal, Ctr Interuniv Rech Anal Organ, CIRANO, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@Univ Montreal, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada@Univ Laval, CIREQ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Univ Laval, GREEN, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada@Univ Laval, CIRANO, Dept Finance & Assurance, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Dufour, JM@University of Montreal@University of Montreal@University of Montreal@Laval University@Laval University@Laval University@Laval University::Khalaf, L@University of Montreal@University of Montreal@University of Montreal@Laval University@Laval University@Laval University@Laval University::Beaulieu, MC@University of Montreal@University of Montreal@University of Montreal@Laval University@Laval University@Laval University@Laval University",not exist,"no title+BARNARD GA+J R STAT SOC B+1963::no title+BEAULIEU MC+TESTING CAPM POSSIBL+2001::EMPIRICAL TESTS OF THE CONSUMPTION-ORIENTED CAPM+BREEDEN, DT; GIBBONS, MR; LITZENBERGER, RH+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUN 1989::no title+Campbell, Y.

Other things equal, if women are over-represented amongst the low paid, we might expect to see the introduction of the NMW narrowing the overall gender pay gap. Using six years of Labour Force Survey data we assess the evidence before and after the introduction of the NMW at various quantiles in the aggregate wage distribution. We go on to document how the proportion of females in various occupations affects male and female pay before and after the advent of the minimum wage. We conclude that there is only moderate evidence of any change in the rate of decline in the average gender pay gap around the period the NMW was introduced.",,"INEQUALITY,EARNINGS","Robinson, H@Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales","Robinson, H@Cardiff University",not exist,"no title+BLAU F+4224 NAT BUR EC RES+1992::no title+BLAU F+AM ECON REV+1994::no title+BOOTH A+UNPUB PROGRAMME LABO+2000::THE EXTENT OF MEASUREMENT ERROR IN LONGITUDINAL EARNINGS DATA - DO 2 WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT+BOUND, J; KRUEGER, AB+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JAN 1991::Recent advances in quantile regression models - A practical guideline for empirical research+Buchinsky, M+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+WIN 1998::Gender and income inequality in the UK 1968-1990: the feminization of earnings or of poverty?+Davies, H; Joshi, H+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1998::Effects of minimum wages on the gender pay gap+Dex, S.; Sutherland, H; Joshi, H.+National Institute Economic Review+2000::no title+Greene, William H.+Econometric Analysis+2000::no title+HANSEN J+217 I STUD LAB+2000::[not available]+HARKNESS S+FISCAL STUDIES+1996::ROBUST-TESTS FOR HETEROSCEDASTICITY BASED ON REGRESSION QUANTILES+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1982::Wage inequality in the United States during the 1980s: Rising dispersion or falling minimum wage?+Lee, DS+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1999::no title+*LOW PAY COMM+NAT MIN WAG STOR FAR+2000::WAGES AND GENDER COMPOSITION - WHY DO WOMENS JOBS PAY LESS+MACPHERSON, DA; HIRSCH, BT+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JUL 1995::How unequally has equal pay progressed since the 1970s?

An I(2) cointegration analysis of price and quantity formation in Danish manufactured exports,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00272,DEC 2002,31,12,"The long-run and short-run structure of the Danish manufacturing export sector is analyzed within a cointegrated vector autoregressive model. The price variables of the analysis can be characterized as integrated of second order, I(2), but long-run homogeneity seems to cancel the I(2)-trend allowing the analysis of a transformed data set to take place within the cointegrated I(1)-framework. Two long-run relations are found and identified as a demand-relation for Danish exports and a polynomially cointegrated price relation. In the price formation a large weight to foreign prices and an effect from the rate of inflation to the steady-state markup are found. The latter effect is interpreted as an element of caution in the price setting in an inflationary environment. To characterize the short-run behaviour of the Danish export-sector a structural representation of the model is developed.",,"EXCHANGE-RATES,MODEL,REPRESENTATION","Nielsen, HB@Univ Copenhagen, Inst Econ, DK-1455 Copenhagen, Denmark","Nielsen, HB@University of Copenhagen",not exist,"THEORY OF DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS DISTINGUISHED BY PLACE OF PRODUCTION+ARMINGTON, PS+INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND STAFF PAPERS+1969::An I(2) analysis of inflation and the markup+Banerjee, A; Cockerell, L; Russell, B+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+MAY-JUN 2001::MONA - A QUARTERLY MODEL OF THE DANISH ECONOMY+CHRISTENSEN, AM; KNUDSEN, D+ECONOMIC MODELLING+JAN 1992::MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION AND OPTIMUM PRODUCT DIVERSITY+DIXIT, AK; STIGLITZ, JE+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1977::Inference in cointegrating models: UK M1 Revisited+Doornik, J.

The empirical model implies that beta depends on news about the market and news about the sector. The asymmetric response of beta to news about the market is consistent across all sectors considered. Recent research is divided as to whether abnormalities in equity returns arise from changes in expected returns in an efficient market or over-reactions to new information. The evidence in this paper suggests that such abnormalities may be due to changes in expected returns caused by time-variation and asymmetry in beta.",,"ASSET PRICING MODEL,VOLATILITY,RETURNS,EFFICIENCY,BEHAVIOR","Brooks, C@Univ Reading, ISMA Ctr, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England@Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia::Henry, OT@Univ Reading, ISMA Ctr, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England@Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia","Brooks, C@University of Reading@University of Melbourne::Henry, OT@University of Reading@University of Melbourne","Brooks, Chris@C-9033-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2668-1153","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::RISK, TIME-VARYING 2ND MOMENTS AND MARKET-EFFICIENCY+ATTANASIO, OP+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+MAY 1991::BIVARIATE GARCH ESTIMATION OF THE OPTIMAL COMMODITY FUTURES HEDGE+BAILLIE, RT; MYERS, RJ+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+APR-JUN 1991::NONSTATIONARY EXPECTED RETURNS - IMPLICATIONS FOR TESTS OF MARKET-EFFICIENCY AND SERIAL-CORRELATION IN RETURNS+BALL, R; KOTHARI, SP+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+NOV 1989::Studies of stock price volatility of changes+Black, F.+American Statistical Association Journal+1976::A CAPITAL-ASSET PRICING MODEL WITH TIME-VARYING COVARIANCES+BOLLERSLEV, T; ENGLE, RF; WOOLDRIDGE, JM+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+FEB 1988::GOOD-NEWS, BAD-NEWS, VOLATILITY, AND BETAS+BRAUN, PA; NELSON, DB; SUNIER, AM+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+DEC 1995::Linear and non-linear transmission of equity return volatility: evidence from the US, Japan and Australia+Brooks, C; Henry, OT+ECONOMIC MODELLING+DEC 2000::The effect of asymmetries on optimal hedge ratios+Brooks, C; Henry, OT; Persand, G+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+APR 2002::NO NEWS IS GOOD-NEWS - AN ASYMMETRIC MODEL OF CHANGING VOLATILITY IN STOCK RETURNS+CAMPBELL, JY; HENTSCHEL, L+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JUN 1992::Measuring abnormal returns: do stocks overreact?+Chopra, N.; Lakinishok, J.; Ritter, J.+J.

Constructing seasonally adjusted data with time-varying confidence intervals,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00275,DEC 2002,24,2,"Seasonal adjustment methods transform observed time series data into estimated data, where these estimated data are constructed such that they show no or almost no seasonal variation. An advantage of model-based methods is that these can provide confidence intervals around the seasonally adjusted data. One particularly useful time series model for seasonal adjustment is the basic structural time series (BSM) model. The usual premise of the BSM is that the variance of each of the components is constant. In this paper we address the possibility that the variance of the trend component in a macroeconomic time series in some way depends on the business cycle. One reason for doing so is that one can expect that there is more uncertainty in recession periods. We extend the BSM by allowing for a business-cycle dependent variance in the level equation. Next we show how this affects the confidence intervals of seasonally adjusted data. We apply our extended BSM to monthly US unemployment and we show that the estimated confidence intervals for seasonally adjusted unemployment change with past changes in the oil price.",,"SERIES,COMPONENTS,VARIANCE","Koopman, SJ@Free Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands@Erasmus Univ, Econometr Inst, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands::Franses, PH@Free Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands@Erasmus Univ, Econometr Inst, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Koopman, SJ@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam@Erasmus University Rotterdam::Franses, PH@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam@Erasmus University Rotterdam","Koopman, Siem Jan@E-1838-2011::Franses, Philip Hans@D-4398-2009::Koopman, S.J.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4440-9524","SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT AND KALMAN FILTERING - EXTENSION TO PERIODIC VARIANCES+BURRIDGE, P; WALLIS, KF+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+MAR-APR 1990::CALCULATING THE VARIANCE OF SEASONALLY ADJUSTED SERIES+BURRIDGE, P; WALLIS, KF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::CHANGES IN SEASONAL PATTERNS - ARE THEY CYCLICAL+CANOVA, F; GHYSELS, E+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+NOV 1994::Diagnosing shocks in time series+de Jong, P; Penzer, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1998::no title+DOOMIK JA+OX OBJECT ORIENTED M+1998::no title+Durbin, J; Koopman, SJ.+TIME SERIES ANAL STA+2001::New capabilities and methods of the X-12-ARIMA seasonal-adjustment program+Findley, DF; Monsell, BC; Bell, WR; et al.+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1998::Quarterly US Unemployment: Cycles, Seasons and Asymmetries+Franses, P.

Series-specific unit root tests with panel data,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00276,DEC 2002,24,89,"A unit root testing procedure is presented that exploits the well-established power advantages of panel estimation while rectifying a deficiency in other panel unit root tests. This test (called SURADF) is based on seemingly unrelated regressions applied to Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests for a unit root. In contrast to extant panel unit root tests, our test allows for determination of which members of the panel reject the null hypothesis of a unit root and which ones do not. The power of the test is investigated with Monte Carlo simulation and demonstrated with application to several panels of real exchange rates. We find that when the contemporaneous cross-correlations of the residuals are high, our procedure has substantially more power to reject a unit root than the single equation Dickey-Fuller test.",,"PURCHASING POWER PARITY,REAL EXCHANGE-RATES,PERIOD,FLOAT","Breuer, JB@Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA@Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA@Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA::McNown, R@Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA@Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA@Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA::Wallace, M@Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA@Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA@Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA","Breuer, JB@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina System@University of Colorado System@University of Colorado Boulder@Clemson University::McNown, R@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina System@University of Colorado System@University of Colorado Boulder@Clemson University::Wallace, M@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina System@University of Colorado System@University of Colorado Boulder@Clemson University",not exist,"PURCHASING POWER PARITY IN THE LONG-RUN+ABUAF, N; JORION, P+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+MAR 1990::TESTING FOR UNIT ROOTS IN PANEL-DATA - ARE WAGES ON DIFFERENT BARGAINING LEVELS COINTEGRATED+BREITUNG, J; MEYER, W+APPLIED ECONOMICS+APR 1994::An Assessment of the Evidence on Purchasing Power Parity+BREUER, J.

On the specification of the drift and diffusion functions for continuous-time models of the spot interest rate,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00277,DEC 2002,9,1,This paper explores the specification of drift and diffusion functions for continuous-time short-term interest rate models. Various forms for the drift and diffusion of 7-day Eurodollar rates are proposed and then estimated by discrete maximum-likelihood. The results suggest that a nonparametric specification of drift and volatility in terms of orthogonal polynomial expansions is effective in eliminating problems of parameter identification encountered previously.

Asymmetric interest rate effects for the UK real economy,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00028,SEP 2002,34,19,"Recent literature has uncovered asymmetries in the response of real output to monetary policy variables. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether such asymmetries relate to different responses to monetary policy or to the business cycle. This paper uses nonlinear models to examine the issues in the context of interest rate effects on quarterly UK GDP growth. Strong evidence of nonlinearity is found, with asymmetry relating to the business cycle through lagged GDP regimes and interest rate changes. The results suggest that interest rate effects on GDP are larger when either lagged growth has been high or when interest rates have substantially increased in the past. However, the inclusion of interest rate regimes without taking account of GDP regimes yields an unsatisfactory model.",,"TRANSITION AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS,BUSINESS-CYCLE,MONETARY-POLICY,TIME-SERIES,NONLINEARITIES,REGIMES","Sensier, M@Univ Manchester, Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Sch Econ Studies, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England@Middle E Tech Univ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey::Osborn, DR@Univ Manchester, Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Sch Econ Studies, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England@Middle E Tech Univ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey::Ocal, N@Univ Manchester, Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Sch Econ Studies, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England@Middle E Tech Univ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey","Sensier, M@University of Manchester@Middle East Technical University::Osborn, DR@University of Manchester@Middle East Technical University::Ocal, N@University of Manchester@Middle East Technical University","Osborn, Denise@B-8692-2008","Predicting the probability of a recession with nonlinear autoregressive leading-indicator models+Anderson, HM; Vahid, F+MACROECONOMIC DYNAMICS+SEP 2001::no title+BEC F+IN PRESS STUDIES NON+2002::Predicting UK business cycle regimes+Birchenhall, CR; Osborn, DR; Sensier, M+SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+MAY 2001::Asymmetric monetary effects on interest rates across monetary policy stances+Choi, WG+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+AUG 1999::ASYMMETRIC EFFECTS OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE MONEY-SUPPLY SHOCKS+COVER, JP+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 1992::How Does Macroeconomic Policy Affect Output?+De Long, J.

Expenditure estimates from recall surveys appear to have measurement errors correlated with household size.

Short- and long-run price level uncertainty under different monetary policy regimes: an international comparison,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00018,JUL 2002,42,7,"This paper focuses on the implications of different monetary regimes for short- and long-run price uncertainty. We derive. expressions for the relative variance of short- and long-run uncertainty under price level targeting and price drift regimes and measure the relative size of these uncertainties in regimes dating from 1717 to present for several major economies. We find that: within regimes short- and long-run uncertainties are positively associated; across regimes this positive association increases with the drift in the price level; the marginal increase in short-run uncertainty under price level targeting is substantially larger than the marginal increase in long-run uncertainty under price drift; and it is short-run uncertainty that is more closely associated with real activity, regardless of regime choice. Our results may be viewed as suggesting that the postwar period move to more persistent inflation constitutes a move towards optimal monetary policy.",,"EXCHANGE-RATE REGIMES,INFLATION UNCERTAINTY,BUSINESS CYCLES,PERSISTENCE,GROWTH","Chadha, JS@Univ Cambridge Clare Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TL, England@Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England@Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA::Sarno, L@Univ Cambridge Clare Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TL, England@Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England@Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA","Chadha, JS@University of Cambridge@University of Warwick@Federal Reserve System - USA@Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis::Sarno, L@University of Cambridge@University of Warwick@Federal Reserve System - USA@Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis","Chadha, Jagjit@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7549-9027","THE PHILLIPS-CURVE, THE PERSISTENCE OF INFLATION, AND THE LUCAS CRITIQUE - EVIDENCE FROM EXCHANGE-RATE REGIMES+ALOGOSKOUFIS, GS; SMITH, R+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1991::Inflation and uncertainty at short and long horizons+Ball, L.; Cecchetti, S.G.+Brookings Papers on Economic Activity+1990::MONEY AND THE PRICE-LEVEL UNDER THE GOLD STANDARD+BARRO, RJ+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+1979::THE FISHER HYPOTHESIS AND THE FORECASTABILITY AND PERSISTENCE OF INFLATION+BARSKY, RB+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+JAN 1987::FORECASTING PRE-WORLD-WAR-I INFLATION - THE FISHER EFFECT AND THE GOLD STANDARD+BARSKY, RB; DELONG, JB+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1991::SURVEY VS ARCH MEASURES OF INFLATION UNCERTAINTY+BATCHELOR, R; DUA, P+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1993::Measuring business cycles: Approximate band-pass filters for economic time series+Baxter, M; King, RG+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1999::Pioneering price level targeting: The Swedish experience 1931-1937+Berg, C; Jonung, L+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+JUN 1999::STOCHASTIC DEVALUATION RISK AND THE EMPIRICAL FIT OF TARGET-ZONE MODELS+BERTOLA, G; SVENSSON, LEO+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1993::no title+BLAKE NS+AM ECON REV+1986::Exchange rate regimes and inflation persistence+Bleaney, M+IMF STAFF PAPERS+2001::no title+Blinder, Alan S.+Central Banking in Theory and Practice+1998::Monetary policy regimes and economic performance: the historical record+Bordo, MD; Schwartz, AJ.+HDB MACROECONOMICS A+1999::Inflation crises and long-run growth+Bruno, M; Easterly, W+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+FEB 1998::no title+CHADHA JS+IN PRESS MANCHESTER+2002::The science of monetary policy: A new keynesian perspective+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+DEC 1999::On measuring the effect of inflation uncertainty on real GNP growth+Davis, G; Kanago, B+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 1996::no title+Diebold, F.

Business fixed investment: evidence of a financial accelerator in Europe,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00020,JUL 2002,22,19,"Financial accelerator theories imply that weak balance sheets can amplify adverse shocks on firm investment. This effect should be asymmetric, stronger in downturns than in upturns and stronger for small firms than for large firms. This paper provides empirical evidence of. the presence of a financial accelerator in the four largest euro area economies: Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Using annual firm balance sheet data over the period 1983-1997 it is shown that weak balance sheets are more important in explaining investment during downturns than during upturns.

To show this we elaborate on the standard framework of international portfolio choices models by allowing for heterogeneous agents and regime shifts. The equilibrium of this model yields a cointegration relationship, with structural breaks, between the exchange rate and two macroeconomic variables, the long-term real interest rates differential and the net market position on foreign assets. It is empirically validated by use of Gregory and Hansen's test (1996). The forecasts of the model outperform those of a random walk.

The British Beveridge curve: A tale of ten regions,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00019,JUL 2002,30,20,"Recent work has suggested the possibility that the Beveridge curve can shift over the business cycle. This is in contrast with a large body of literature claiming that Beveridge curves have shifted due to structural changes alone. To test these claims, we use county-level data to estimate the timing and magnitude of shifts in aggregate and regional British Beveridge curves. We find that these shifts coincide with the business cycle rather than with hysteresis effects or with changes in regional mismatch. This implies that the Beveridge curve is a flawed device for separating the effects of structural changes from those of the business cycle.",,"MATCHING FUNCTION,UNEMPLOYMENT,VACANCIES","Wall, HJ@Fed Res Bank St Louis, Res Div, St Louis, MO 63166 USA@Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Dept Econ, London W1T 1LL, England::Zoega, G@Fed Res Bank St Louis, Res Div, St Louis, MO 63166 USA@Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Dept Econ, London W1T 1LL, England","Wall, HJ@Federal Reserve System - USA@Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis@Birkbeck University London@University of London::Zoega, G@Federal Reserve System - USA@Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis@Birkbeck University London@University of London","zoega, gylfi@M-3622-2015","no title+ABRAHAM K+BROOKINGS PAPERS EC+1987::no title+BAKER S+CANADIAN J EC+1996::UNEMPLOYMENT AND RISK OF MINOR PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDER IN YOUNG-PEOPLE - CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL EVIDENCE+BANKS, MH; JACKSON, PR+PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE+1982::EUROPEAN UNEMPLOYMENT - A SURVEY+BEAN, CR+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+JUN 1994::no title+BLANCHARD O+BROOKINGS PAPERS EC+1989::RANKING, UNEMPLOYMENT DURATION, AND WAGES+BLANCHARD, OJ; DIAMOND, P+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1994::PANEL DATA-ANALYSIS OF THE BEVERIDGE CURVE - IS THERE A MACROECONOMIC RELATION BETWEEN THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE VACANCY RATE+BORSCHSUPAN, AH+ECONOMICA+AUG 1991::no title+BOWDEN RJ+ECONOMICA+1980::no title+BUDD A+ECON J+1987::no title+COLES MG+939 CEPR+1995::Cross-section estimation of the matching function: Evidence from England and Wales+Coles, MG; Smith, E+ECONOMICA+NOV 1996::no title+Courtney, Hugh George.+The Beveridge Curve and Okun's Law: A Re-Examination of Fundamental Relationships in the United States+1991::no title+Gartner, M.+A Primer in European Macroeconomics+1997::no title+GREGG P+13 OXF LAB MARK CONS+1997::no title+HEADY P+LIVING STANDARDS UNE+1989::Mismatch: a Framework for Thought+JACKMAN, R.; LAYARD, R.; SAVOURI, S.+Mismatch and labour mobility+1991::ON VACANCIES+JACKMAN, R; LAYARD, R; PISSARIDES, C+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1989::STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT+JACKMAN, R; ROPER, S+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1987::Labour Market Policies and Unemployment in the OECD+Jackman, Richard; Pissarides, Christopher; Savouri, Savvas<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Kapteyn, Arie; Lambert, Jean-Paul</span>.+Economic Policy+1990::LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, HYSTERESIS AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT VACANCY RELATIONSHIP - A REGIONAL-ANALYSIS+JONES, DR; MANNING, DN+REGIONAL STUDIES+1992::The labour market+Layard, R.; Nickell, S.+&lt;IT&gt;The Performance of the British Economy&lt;/IT&gt;+1987::WHY DOES UNEMPLOYMENT PERSIST+LAYARD, R; BEAN, C+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+1989::Preventing Long-Term Unemployment: An Economic Analysis+Layard, R.; de la Dehesa, G.+Unemployment Policy: Government Options for the Labour Market+1997::no title+Layard, R.

Ex-participants are more likely to be employed four years after leaving school than non-participants, and have higher exit rates from unemployment. However, a large proportion of, 'successful' outcomes are accounted for by participants who are kept on by their training providers after training finishes.

"Job tenure in Britain, 1975-2000. Is a job for life or just for Christmas?",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00015,MAY 2002,17,19,"We use household survey evidence to assess whether job tenure has changed in Britain over the last twenty years and, if so, which individuals are affected and what are the possible causes. After first reconciling apparently conflicting evidence from two separate data sources, we show that small falls in job tenture measures at the aggregate level disguise more obvious changes across age and gender. For nearly three quarters of the workforce, men and women without dependent children, job tenure has fallen over the past twenty-five years. Job tenure has risen only amongst women with dependent children, driven, we believe, by the increasing propensity of women to return to the same employer after child birth. Allowing for the cycle, the results suggest that there has been only a modest increase in short-term employment spells, but more dramatic falls are observed among long-term jobs. The decline in long-term jobs is most pronounced for older workers. The changing nature of jobs on offer, specifically the movement from full-time to higher turnover part-time, temporary jobs or self-employment and the changing industrial composition of the workforce can explain around one quarter of these trends.

The augmented Solow model and the African growth debate,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00016,MAY 2002,34,77,"Using panel data the question whether Africa's growth performance can be accounted for is analysed in the framework of the augmented Solow model, OLS levels results suggest that the model cannot fully account for Africa's low growth performance. However, these OLS estimates are likely to suffer from inconsistency and endogeneity problems. As our preferred estimation method we suggest the use of recently developed system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. Our system GMM results indicate that the augmented Solow model can account for Africa's low growth performance, provided that we allow for unobserved country specific effects and the endogeneity of investment in estimating the parameters of the model. Hence, rather than concentrating research efforts on the analysis of a spurious Africa dummy, it may be more worthwhile to focus on the continent's low investment ratios and high population growth rates, which we found to be sufficient to explain Africa's low growth rates.",,"PANEL-DATA,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,DYNAMIC-MODELS","Hoeffler, AE@Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford, England","Hoeffler, AE@University of Oxford",not exist,"A Model for Technical Inefficiency Effects in a Stochastic Frontier Production Function for Panel Data+Aigner, D.J.+Empirical Economics+1995::FORMULATION AND ESTIMATION OF DYNAMIC-MODELS USING PANEL DATA+ANDERSON, TW; HSIAO, C+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1982::ANOTHER LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+ARELLANO, M; BOVER, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::no title+Barro, R.

We test this hypothesis for UK firms. The relationship between exporting and firm variables is significantly different for firms that have experienced a major innovation (""innovating firms""). Noninnovating firms are more likely to export if they have lower unit labour costs, whilst innovating firms are more likely to do so if they have had more innovations. Ceteris paribus, the probability that a firm is an exporter is higher if it is in a sector with high R&D expenditures (relative to output), which is consistent with product cycle theories of trade. For non-innovators, firms are also more likely to be exporters in sectors with low capital intensity.",,"FACTOR ABUNDANCE,FIRM-LEVEL,BEHAVIOR,COLOMBIA,MODEL","Bleaney, M@Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Wakelin, K@Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Bleaney, M@University of Nottingham::Wakelin, K@University of Nottingham",not exist,"Spillovers, foreign investment, and export behavior+Aitken, B; Hanson, GH; Harrison, AE+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+AUG 1997::PRODUCTIVITY AND THE EXPORT MARKET - A FIRM-LEVEL ANALYSIS+AW, BY; HWANG, AR+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+AUG 1995::Exceptional exporter performance: cause, effect, or both?+Bernard, AB; Jensen, JB+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+FEB 1999::Exports and success in German manufacturing+Bernard, AB; Wagner, J+WELTWIRTSCHAFTLICHES ARCHIV-REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS+1997::MULTICOUNTRY, MULTIFACTOR TESTS OF THE FACTOR ABUNDANCE THEORY+BOWEN, HP; LEAMER, EE; SVEIKAUSKAS, L+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1987::JUDGING FACTOR ABUNDANCE+BOWEN, HP; SVEIKAUSKAS, L+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1992::Technological gaps and institutional asymmetries in a North-South model with a continuum of goods+Cimoli, M.+Metroeconomica+1988::Is learning by exporting important?

The causal effect of class size on scholastic achievement: distinguishing the pure class size effect from the effect of changes in class composition,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.00003,FEB 2002,18,32,"This paper estimates the causal effect of class size on school performance in Dutch primary schools using an instrumental variable approach. The instrument used is based on Dutch regulations determining the numbers of teachers as a function of school enrollment. Without instrumenting class size the effect of class size on school performance is non-negative (smaller classes are not associated with higher performance). After instrumenting class size, the effects become larger (more positive). Hence the non-negative effect of class size cannot be attributed to endogeneity bias. Next we investigate an explanation for the non-negative class size effect advanced in the social cognitive learning literature. This literature strongly suggests that pupils' achievement may benefit from a larger number of classmates with a similar level of ability. As class size reduction also reduces the expected number of classmates with similar ability, this effect may neutralize the pure class size effect. To test this idea, we repeat the analyses including the number of classmates with similar IQ as an additional regressor. The results show that this new variable has a highly significant and positive effect on school performance. In addition, inclusion of this variable reduces the class size coefficient and in most cases produces the proper negative sign.",,"STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT,PEER MODELS,SCHOOLS","Dobbelsteen, S@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands::Levin, J@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands::Oosterbeek, H@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands","Dobbelsteen, S@University of Amsterdam::Levin, J@University of Amsterdam::Oosterbeek, H@University of Amsterdam",not exist,"DOES CLASS SIZE MATTER+AKERHIELM, K+ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW+SEP 1995::Using Maimonides' rule to estimate the effect of class size on scholastic achievement+Angrist, JD; Lavy, V+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1999::FACTORS DETERMINING VICARIOUS EXTINCTION OF AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR THROUGH SYMBOLIC MODELING+BANDURA, A; MENLOVE, FL+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+1968::no title+Bandura, A.+Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory+1986::no title+BOOZER M+NBER WORKING PAPER+1995::no title+BOSKER RJ+KLASSENVERKLEINING A+1996::no title+DEARDEN L+IN PRESS REV EC STAT+2002::SOCIAL-COMPARISON, TASK MOTIVATION, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-EVALUATIVE STANDARDS IN CHILDREN+FRANCEKAATRUDE, AC; SMITH, WP+DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY+1985::THE ECONOMICS OF SCHOOLING - PRODUCTION AND EFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC-SCHOOLS+HANUSHEK, EA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+SEP 1986::The effects of class size on student achievement: New evidence from population variation+Hoxby, CM+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2000::no title+KRUEGER AB+ECON J+2001::Experimental estimates of education production functions+Krueger, AB+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1999::no title+LAZEAR EP+NBER WORKING PAPER+1999::no title+Schunk, D.

No significant changes in hours worked by either full- or part-time women are found 1, 2 and 3 years after the NMW, and no change in the probabilities of remaining in full- or part-time work or transiting between the two.",,EMPLOYMENT,"Connolly, S@Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ & Social Studies, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England@Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England@Univ Oxford, St Hildas Coll, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England::Gregory, M@Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ & Social Studies, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England@Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England@Univ Oxford, St Hildas Coll, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England","Connolly, S@University of East Anglia@University of Oxford@University of Oxford::Gregory, M@University of East Anglia@University of Oxford@University of Oxford",not exist,"no title+ABOWD JM+WORKING PAPER NBER+1999::DETERMINATION OF DAILY HOURS AND WAGES+BARZEL, Y+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+1973::Looking for a needle in a haystack?

"The national minimum wage: Coverage, impact and future",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/1468-0084.64.s.1,2002,30,10,"Since its establishment in 1997, the Low Pay Commission (LPC) - whose main task is to recommend the rate for the national minimum wage (NMW) to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry - has operated in a very open manner. Commissioners and the (small) secretariat have visited all the corners of the UK and hundreds of workplaces. Large volumes of written evidence and much oral evidence inform successive reports (LPC 1998, 2000, 200 1 a,b, 2003). The LPC also values and nurtures its links with the academic community, many of whom have undertaken research for the LPC which has greatly contributed to the debate on the merits or otherwise of the NMW. In addition the LPC have periodically held conferences where the latest research on low pay and the NMW is discussed and evaluated. Some of the papers in this volume were originally presented at just such a conference hosted by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics (LSE) on 28 September 2001 and organized (beautifully) by Joanna Swaffield of York University. In what follows the conference papers, those published in this volume, and related research are put into context. Section I deals with the thorny matter of coverage and data. The impact of the NMW on the pay distribution, employment and incomes is set out in section II. Some thoughts on the future of the NMW follow in section III.",,BRITAIN,"Metcalf, D@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England","Metcalf, D@University of London@London School Economics & Political Science",not exist,"no title+ACEMOGLU D+IN PRESS RES LABOR E+2003::no title+ARULAMPALAM W+UNPUB WORK RELATED T+2002::Looking for a needle in a haystack?

The results indicate that, although the minimum wage had differential wage-distribution effects across the 140 areas of the country, employment growth after its introduction was not significantly lower in areas of the country with a high proportion of low-wage workers, whose wages had to be raised to comply, from that in areas with a low proportion of such workers.",,"FAST-FOOD INDUSTRY,NEW-JERSEY,EMPLOYMENT,PENNSYLVANIA,ECONOMICS","Stewart, MB@Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Stewart, MB@University of Warwick","Stewart, Mark@A-9496-2008","no title+ABOWD JM+UNPUB TAIL 2 COUNTRI+2000::Empirical strategies in labor economics+Angrist, J.; Krueger, A.+HDB LABOR EC+1999::Minimum Wages, Employment, and the Distribution of Income+Brown, Charles.+HDB LABOR EC+1999::A reassessment of the new economics of the minimum wage literature with monthly data from the Current Population Survey+Burkhauser, RV; Couch, KA; Wittenburg, DC+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+OCT 2000::MINIMUM-WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT - A CASE-STUDY OF THE FAST-FOOD INDUSTRY IN NEW-JERSEY AND PENNSYLVANIA+CARD, D; KRUEGER, AB+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1994::USING REGIONAL VARIATION IN WAGES TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF THE FEDERAL MINIMUM-WAGE+CARD, D+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+OCT 1992::no title+Card, D.; Krueger, A.+Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage+1995::EMPLOYMENT AND THE 1990-1991 MINIMUM-WAGE HIKE+DEERE, D; MURPHY, KM; WELCH, F+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1995::The effects of minimum wages on employment: Theory and evidence from Britain+Dickens, R; Machin, S; Manning, A+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JAN 1999::The economic impact of minimum wages in Europe+Dolado, JJ; Kramarz, F; Machin, S<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Manning, A; Margolis, D; Teulings, C; Saint-Paul, G; Keen, M</span>.+Econ Policy+1996::no title+HUBER PJ+5TH P BERK S MATH ST+1967::THE ECONOMIC-IMPACTS OF MINIMUM-WAGE LAWS - A NEW LOOK AT AN OLD QUESTION+LINNEMAN, P+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1982::THE EFFECTS OF MINIMUM-WAGES ON WAGE DISPERSION AND EMPLOYMENT - EVIDENCE FROM THE UK WAGES COUNCILS+MACHIN, S; MANNING, A+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+JAN 1994::no title+MACHIN S+UNPUB CARE HOME WORK+2002::NATURAL AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTS IN ECONOMICS+MEYER, BD+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1995::RANDOM GROUP EFFECTS AND THE PRECISION OF REGRESSION ESTIMATES+MOULTON, BR+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+AUG 1986::Minimum wages and employment: A case study of the fast-food industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Comment+Neumark, D; Wascher, W+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2000::no title+NEUMARK D+NBER WORKING PAPER+2000::no title+no author+Regional Tends+2001::no title+PARTINGTON J+LABOUR MARKET TR MAY+2001::no title+STEWART M+630 U WARW EC DEP+2002"

Maximum likelihood estimates of the hazard are calculated using a sample of multinational enterprises (MNEs) that invested in Central and Eastern Europe over the period 1990-98. Employing a standard, non-parametric specification of the hazard, our measure of uncertainty has a negative effect on investment, but the reduced-form model is unable to control for nonlinearities in the relationship. The structural estimation of the option-based hazard is instead able to account for the nonlinearities and exhibits a significant value of waiting, although the latter is independent of our measure of uncertainty.

We propose a further test, based on the ratio of these statistics, which is consistent against changes either from I(0) to I(1), or vice versa, yet does not over-reject against constant I(0) series.

The paper discusses the modification by Hartung (1999, Biometrical Journal, Vol. 41, pp. 849-855), which is designed to allow for a certain correlation matrix of the transformed P-values. First, the modified inverse normal method is shown here to be valid with more general correlation matrices. Secondly, a necessary and sufficient condition for (asymptotic) normality is provided, using the copula approach. Thirdly, applications to panels of cross-correlated time series, stationary as well as integrated, are considered.

We call this new model the latent multinomial logit (LMNL) model. A constrained version of the LMNL model is used to examine the issue of hidden unemployment in transition economies following the approach of Earle and Sakova (2000).

The impact of training on productivity and wages: Evidence from british panel data,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00170.x,AUG 2006,54,109,It is standard in the literature on training to use wages as a sufficient statistic for productivity. This paper examines the effects of work-related training on direct measures of productivity. Using a new panel of British industries 1983-96 and a variety of estimation techniques we find that work-related training is associated with significantly higher productivity. A 1% point increase in training is associated with an increase in value added per hour of about 0.6% and an increase in hourly wages of about 0.3%. We also show evidence using individual-level data sets that is suggestive of training externalities.,,"LEVEL PRODUCTION-FUNCTIONS,JOB-PERFORMANCE,EARNINGS,WORKERS,DETERMINANTS,EDUCATION,EQUATIONS,RETURNS,GROWTH,MODELS","Dearden, Lorraine@Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England@Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1N 1AZ, England@Inst Publ Policy Res, London, England@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England@CEPR, London, England::Reed, Howard@Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England@Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1N 1AZ, England@Inst Publ Policy Res, London, England@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England@CEPR, London, England::Van Reenen, John@Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England@Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1N 1AZ, England@Inst Publ Policy Res, London, England@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England@CEPR, London, England","Dearden, Lorraine@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University College London@University of London@Unknow@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK::Reed, Howard@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University College London@University of London@Unknow@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK::Van Reenen, John@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University College London@University of London@Unknow@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK","Dearden, Lorraine@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9529-8860","The structure of wages and investment in general training+Acemoglu, D; Pischke, JS+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+JUN 1999::How large are human-capital externalities?

Modelling currency crises in emerging markets: A dynamic probit model with unobserved heterogeneity and autocorrelated errors,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00172.x,AUG 2006,34,10,"The paper investigates the causes of currency crises in emerging markets. We estimate the probability of a currency crisis by applying maximum smoothly simulated likelihood to a dynamic LDV model. This approach allows us to take explicit account of the existence of intertemporal links between crises. The results show that currency crises are influenced by real, monetary, debt and global variables. Past banking crises are significant determinants of the probability of currency crises. Moreover, countries that sharply devalued in the past are less prone to experience another currency crisis. We find evidence of unobserved heterogeneity, which may reflect differences in the countries' institutional/historical background. Finally, the determinants of currency crises differ by type of exchange rate regime.",,"OF-PAYMENTS CRISES,BALANCE,BANKING","Falcetti, Elisabetta@EBRD, London EC2A 2JN, England@Bank England, London EC2R 8AH, England::Tudela, Merxe@EBRD, London EC2A 2JN, England@Bank England, London EC2R 8AH, England","Falcetti, Elisabetta@Unknow@Bank of England::Tudela, Merxe@Unknow@Bank of England",not exist,"no title+BISAT A+SEQUENCING FINANCIAL+1999::Health, children, and elderly living arrangements: a multi-period-multinomial probit model with unobserved heterogeneity and autocorrelated errors+Borsch-Supan, A.; Hajivassiliou, V.; Kotlikoff, L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Morris, L</span>.+TOPICS EC AGING+1992::SMOOTH UNBIASED MULTIVARIATE PROBABILITY SIMULATORS FOR MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION OF LIMITED DEPENDENT VARIABLE MODELS+BORSCHSUPAN, A; HAJIVASSILIOU, VA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+AUG 1993::no title+CALVO G+DEBT BURDEN ITS CONS+1997::no title+CAPRIO GJ+1312 WORLD BANK+1996::no title+CHANG R+NBER WORKING PAPERS+1999::The determinants of banking crises in developing and developed countries+Demirguc-Kunt, A; Detragiache, E+INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND STAFF PAPERS+MAR 1998::no title+DEMIRGUCKUNT A+WP300 IMF+2000::no title+DEMIRGUCKUNT A+WP8398 IMF+1998::Exchange market mayhem: The antecedents and aftermath of speculative attacks+Eichengreen, B; Rose, AK; Wyplosz, C.+Economic Policy+1995::Contagious currency crises: First tests+Eichengreen, B; Rose, A; Wyplosz, C+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+1996::Staying Afloat When the Wind Shifts: External Factors and Emerging-Market Banking Crises+Eichengreen, B.; Rose, A.

It is shown that second differences of the effects can be estimated without any normalization restrictions, providing information on the shape of the age-, cohort- and time-effect profiles, and enabling identification of structural breaks. A Wald test is provided to test the popular linear and quadratic specifications against a very general alternative. The method is illustrated through examples which show its ability to detect structural breaks in time effects as a result of the Mexican peso crisis, and to determine whether the age-effect profile in the variance of Taiwanese log consumption is concave or convex.",,HOUSEHOLDS,"McKenzie, David J.@World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA","McKenzie, David J.@The World Bank",not exist,"A cohort analysis of saving behavior by US households+Attanasio, O.+NBER Working Paper, 4454+1993::Cohort analysis of saving behavior by US households+Attanasio, OP+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SUM 1998::PANEL DATA FROM TIME-SERIES OF CROSS-SECTIONS+DEATON, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT-NOV 1985::INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE AND INEQUALITY+DEATON, A; PAXSON, C+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+JUN 1994::no title+Deaton, Angus.+The Analysis of Household Surveys : A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy+1997::Age, trend, and cohort effects in a macro model of Canadian expenditure patterns+Denton, FT; Mountain, DC; Spencer, BG+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 1999::COHORT ANALYSIS AND DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSLATION - A COMPARATIVE-STUDY OF RECENT TRENDS IN AGE SPECIFIC FERTILITY RATES FROM EUROPE AND NORTH-AMERICA+FOSTER, A+POPULATION STUDIES-A JOURNAL OF DEMOGRAPHY+JUL 1990::Identifying the role of cognitive ability in explaining the level of and change in the return to schooling+Heckman, J; Vytlacil, E+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2001::Using Longitudinal Data to Estimate Age, Period, and Cohort Effects in Earnings Equations+Heckman, James; Robb, Richard.+Cohort Analysis in Social Research+1985::no title+JAPELLI T+REV INCOME WEALTH+1999::no title+Mason, W.

Panel unit-root tests for cross-sectionally correlated panels: A monte carlo comparison,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00176.x,AUG 2006,22,29,"This paper deals with the finite-sample performance of a set of unit-root tests for cross-correlated panels. Most of the available macroeconomic time series cover short time periods. The lack of information, in terms of time observations, implies that univariate tests are not powerful enough to reject the null of a unit-root while panel tests, by exploiting the large number of cross-sectional units, have been shown to be a promising way of increasing the power of unit-root tests. We investigate the finite sample properties of recently proposed panel unit-root tests for cross-sectionally correlated panels. Specifically, the size and power of Choi's [Econometric Theory and Practice: Frontiers of Analysis and Applied Research: Essays in Honor of Peter C. B. Phillips, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (2001)], Bai and Ng's [Econometrica (2004), Vol. 72, p. 1127], Moon and Perron's [Journal of Econometrics (2004), Vol. 122, p. 81], and Phillips and Sul's [Econometrics Journal (2003), Vol. 6, p. 217] tests are analysed by a Monte Carlo simulation study. In synthesis, Moon and Perron's tests show good size and power for different values of T and N, and model specifications. Focusing on Bai and Ng's procedure, the simulation study highlights that the pooled Dickey-Fuller generalized least squares test provides higher power than the pooled augmented Dickey-Fuller test for the analysis of non-stationary properties of the idiosyncratic components. Choi's tests are strongly oversized when the common factor influences the cross-sectional units heterogeneously.",,,"Gutierrez, Luciano@Univ Sassari, Dept Agr Econ, I-07100 Sassari, Italy","Gutierrez, Luciano@University of Sassari",not exist,"A panic attack on unit roots and cointegration+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2004::Determining the number of factors in approximate factor models+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::no title+BAJERJEE A+OXFORD B ECON STAT+1999::Nonstationary Panels, Cointegration in Panels and Dynamic Panels: A Survey+Baltagi, B.

"Inflation uncertainty, output growth uncertainty and macroeconomic performance",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00164.x,JUN 2006,61,63,"We use a bivariate generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic (GARCH) model of inflation and output growth to examine the causality relationship among nominal uncertainty, real uncertainty and macroeconomic performance measured by the inflation and output growth rates. The application of the constant conditional correlation GARCH( 1,1) model leads to a number of interesting conclusions. First, inflation does cause negative welfare effects, both directly and indirectly, i.e. via the inflation uncertainty channel. Secondly, in some countries, more inflation uncertainty provides an incentive to Central Banks to surprise the public by raising inflation unexpectedly. Thirdly, in contrast to the assumptions of some macroeconomic models, business cycle variability and the rate of economic growth are related. More variability in the business cycle leads to more output growth.",,"MONETARY-POLICY,STABILIZATION POLICY,GENERALIZED ARCH,GARCH MODEL,VARIABILITY,UK,VARIANCE,IRREVERSIBILITY,PERSPECTIVE,VOLATILITY","Fountas, S@Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece@Brunel Univ, Sch Business, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England@Gangwon Dev Res Inst, Chunchon, South Korea::Karanasos, M@Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece@Brunel Univ, Sch Business, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England@Gangwon Dev Res Inst, Chunchon, South Korea::Kim, J@Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece@Brunel Univ, Sch Business, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England@Gangwon Dev Res Inst, Chunchon, South Korea","Fountas, S@University of Macedonia@Brunel University@Unknow::Karanasos, M@University of Macedonia@Brunel University@Unknow::Kim, J@University of Macedonia@Brunel University@Unknow",not exist,"CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE AND MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE - SOME COMPARATIVE EVIDENCE+ALESINA, A; SUMMERS, LH+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+MAY 1993::Private Information, Money and Growth Indeterminacy: Fluctuations and Mundell-Tobin Effect+Azariadis, Costa; Smith, Bruth.+Journal of Economic Growth+1996::Analysing inflation by the fractionally integrated ARFIMA-GARCH model+Baillie, RT; Chung, CF; Tieslau, MA+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1996::WHY DOES HIGH INFLATION RAISE INFLATION UNCERTAINTY+BALL, L+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+JUN 1992::no title+Black,, F.+Business Cycles and Equilibrium+1987::Can stabilisation policy reduce long-run growth?+Blackburn, K+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JAN 1999::On the relationship between growth and volatility+Blackburn, K; Pelloni, A+ECONOMICS LETTERS+APR 2004::Growth, cycles, and stabilization policy+Blackburn, K; Pelloni, A+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+APR 2005::MODELING THE COHERENCE IN SHORT-RUN NOMINAL EXCHANGE-RATES - A MULTIVARIATE GENERALIZED ARCH MODEL+BOLLERSLEV, T+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1990::ARCH models', Handbook of Econometrics+Bollerslev, T; Engle, R F; Nelson, D B.+HDB ECONOMETRICS+1994::no title+BRIAULT C+BANK ENGLAND Q B+1995::INFLATION REGIMES AND THE SOURCES OF INFLATION UNCERTAINTY - COMMENT+BRUNNER, AD+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+AUG 1993::no title+BRUNO M+REVIEW           MAY+1996::The relationship between output variability and growth: Evidence from post war UK data+Caporale, T; McKiernan, B+SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+MAY 1996::The Fischer Black hypothesis: Some time-series evidence+Caporale, T; McKiernan, B+SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JAN 1998::no title+CECCHETTI S+NBER WORKING PAPER+2001::no title+CECCHETTI SG+NBER WORKING PAPER+1999::A causality-in-variance test and its application to financial market prices+Cheung, YW; Ng, LK+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY-JUN 1996::The science of monetary policy: A new keynesian perspective+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+DEC 1999::On the inflation-uncertainty hypothesis in the USA, Japan and the UK: a dual long memory approach+Conrad, C; Karanasos, M+JAPAN AND THE WORLD ECONOMY+AUG 2005::A THEORY OF AMBIGUITY, CREDIBILITY, AND INFLATION UNDER DISCRETION AND ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION+CUKIERMAN, A; MELTZER, AH+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 1986::The inflation bias revisited: Theory and some international evidence+Cukierman, A; Gerlach, S+MANCHESTER SCHOOL+SEP 2003::The level and uncertainty of inflation: Results from OECD forecasts+Davis, GK; Kanago, BE+ECONOMIC INQUIRY+JAN 2000::A POSITIVE THEORY OF INFLATION AND INFLATION VARIANCE+DEVEREUX, M+ECONOMIC INQUIRY+JAN 1989::Inflation uncertainty and growth in a cash-in-advance economy+Dotsey, M; Sarte, PD+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+JUN 2000::Another perspective on the effects of inflation uncertainty+Elder, J+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+OCT 2004::MULTIVARIATE SIMULTANEOUS GENERALIZED ARCH+ENGLE, RF; KRONER, KF+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+MAR 1995::Output variability and economic growth: The Japanese case+Fountas, S.; Karanasos, M.; Mendoza, A.+Bul.

A recursive thick frontier approach to estimating production efficiency,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00158.x,APR 2006,27,2,"We introduce a new panel data estimation technique for production and cost functions, the recursive thick frontier approach (RTFA). RTFA has two advantages over existing econometric frontier methods. First, technical inefficiency is allowed to be dependent on the explanatory variables of the frontier model. Secondly, RTFA does not hinge on distributional assumptions on the inefficiency component of the error term. We show by means of simulation experiments that RTFA outperforms the popular stochastic frontier approach and the 'within' ordinary least squares estimator for realistic parameterizations of a productivity model. Although RTFAs formal statistical properties are unknown, we argue, based on these simulation experiments, that RTFA is a useful complement to existing methods.",,"TECHNICAL INEFFICIENCY,PANEL-DATA,MODELS","Wagenvoort, RJLM@European Investment Bank, Econ & Financial Studies, Luxembourg, Luxembourg@Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada::Schure, PH@European Investment Bank, Econ & Financial Studies, Luxembourg, Luxembourg@Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada","Wagenvoort, RJLM@Unknow@University of Victoria::Schure, PH@Unknow@University of Victoria",not exist,"Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models+Aigner, D.; Lovell, C.; Schmidt, P.+Journal of Econometrics+1977::ESTIMATING INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FUNCTION+AIGNER, DJ; CHU, SF+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1968::no title+Baltagi, Badi.

An analysis of the value added by secondary schools in England: Is the value added indicator of any value?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00159.x,APR 2006,34,12,"This paper argues that the value added score published for all publicly funded secondary schools in England is an unreliable indicator of school performance. A substantial proportion of the between-school variation in the value added score is accounted for by factors outside the school's control. These factors include several pupil-related variables such as the proportion of pupils on free school meals, the authorized absence rate of pupils and the proportion of pupils from ethnic minority backgrounds. The value added score is also related to several school characteristics such as the school's admission policy and its subject specialism. The main policy recommendation of this paper is that the value added score should not be used as a performance indicator, but should be used to gain a better understanding of why the value added score varies between schools.",,"QUASI-MARKETS,PERFORMANCE,ATTAINMENT,ACHIEVEMENT,EDUCATION,QUALITY,ISSUES","Taylor, J@Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England::Nguyen, AN@Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England","Taylor, J@Lancaster University::Nguyen, AN@Lancaster University",not exist,"Ethnicity, educational attainment and the transition from school+Bradley, S; Taylor, J+MANCHESTER SCHOOL+JUN 2004::Testing for quasi-market forces in secondary education+Bradley, S; Crouchley, R; Millington, J; et al.+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+JUL 2000::The effect of school size on exam performance in secondary schools+Bradley, S; Taylor, J+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1998::no title+Coleman, J.; Campbell, E.; Hobson, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; McPart-land, J.; Mood, A.; Weinfield, F.; York, R</span>.+Equality of educational opportunity+1966::no title+no author+Schools achieving success+2001::no title+DOLTON P+9803 U NEWC UPON TYN+1996::Making the grade: Education, the labour market and young people+Dolton, P.; Makepeace, G.; Sutton, S.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Audas, R</span>.+WORK OPPORTUNITY SER+1999::The effect of school quality on student performance: A quantile regression approach+Eide, E; Showalter, MH+ECONOMICS LETTERS+MAR 1998::Attainment in secondary school+Feinstein, L; Symons, J+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+APR 1999::QUASI-MARKETS FOR EDUCATION+GLENNERSTER, H+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+SEP 1991::Using examination results as indicators of school and college performance+Goldstein, H; Thomas, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1996::League tables and their limitations: Statistical issues in comparisons of institutional performance+Goldstein, H; Spiegelhalter, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1996::no title+HANUSHEK EA+121 EC POL I+2000::no title+HANUSHEK EA+981 U ROCH+1998::The failure of input-based schooling policies+Hanushek, EA+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+FEB 2003::THE ECONOMICS OF SCHOOLING - PRODUCTION AND EFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC-SCHOOLS+HANUSHEK, EA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+SEP 1986::ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF SCHOOLS - MEASUREMENT OF STATE VARIATIONS IN ACHIEVEMENT+HANUSHEK, EA; TAYLOR, LL+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SPR 1990::CONCEPTUAL AND EMPIRICAL ISSUES IN THE ESTIMATION OF EDUCATIONAL PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS+HANUSHEK, EA+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+1979::THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN CHILD QUANTITY AND QUALITY+HANUSHEK, EA+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+FEB 1992::What if there are no 'best practices'?+Hanushek, EA+SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+MAY 2004::School Resources and Student Performance+Hanushek, Eric A.+Does Money Matter?

First, conventional labour-demand parameter estimates and unbiased tests for neutrality are obtained in the context of a flexible cost system. The resulting input-specific indices of technical change, unconstrained with respect to time path, facilitate subsequent evaluation of proposed sources. In our application to employment decisions of airline firms, we find labour-saving technical change that is non-neutral across occupations.

Whatever happened to goldilocks?

It was argued that this represented a new paradigm, enabling unemployment to remain low without igniting inflationary pressure. We examine the evidence for a change in the relationship between inflation and unemployment for the US and UK using Phillips curve models. The impact of including explicit inflation expectations is also considered. Inflation expectations are found to play an important role, particularly in the US. When expectations are included there is still evidence that the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) steadily declined during the late 1990s, although this decline in the US NAIRU is not found solely in the 1990s.",,"INFLATION-EXPECTATIONS,MONETARY-POLICY,PHILLIPS-CURVE,UNEMPLOYMENT,DYNAMICS,PRICES,STICKY,MODEL","Driver, RL@Bank England, External MPC Unit, London, England@Bank England, Struct Econ Anal Div, London, England@Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England::Greenslade, JV@Bank England, External MPC Unit, London, England@Bank England, Struct Econ Anal Div, London, England@Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England::Pierse, RG@Bank England, External MPC Unit, London, England@Bank England, Struct Econ Anal Div, London, England@Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England","Driver, RL@Bank of England@Bank of England@University of Surrey::Greenslade, JV@Bank of England@Bank of England@University of Surrey::Pierse, RG@Bank of England@Bank of England@University of Surrey",not exist,"Are U.K. Inflation Expectations Rational?+Bakhshi, H.; Yates, A.+Technical Report 81+1998::no title+BALL L+NBER RES STUDIES BUS+1997::no title+no author+Economic Models at the Bank of England+1999::INFLATION-EXPECTATIONS REVISITED+BATCHELOR, RA; ORR, AB+ECONOMICA+AUG 1988::QUANTITATIVE V QUALITATIVE MEASURES OF INFLATION-EXPECTATIONS+BATCHELOR, RA+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 1986::no title+BRAYTON F+199949 FED RES BOARD+1999::Is inflation dead?+Brinner, RE+NEW ENGLAND ECONOMIC REVIEW+JAN-FEB 1999::STAGGERED PRICES IN A UTILITY-MAXIMIZING FRAMEWORK+CALVO, GA+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+1983::INFLATION EXPECTATIONS+CARLSON, JA; PARKIN, M+ECONOMICA+1975::no title+CASSINO V+153 BANK ENGL+2002::Evolving post-World War II inflation dynamics+Cogley, T.; Sargent, T.+NBER Macroeconomic Annual+2001::Introducing: The survey of professional forecasters+Croushore, D.+Bus.

Cointegration testing in panels with common factors,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00452.x,2006,31,55,"Panel unit-root and no-cointegration tests that rely on cross-sectional independence of the panel unit experience severe size distortions when this assumption is violated, as has, for example, been shown by Banerjee, Marcellino and Osbat [Econometrics Journal (2004), Vol. 7, pp. 322-340; Empirical Economics (2005), Vol. 30, pp. 77-91] via Monte Carlo simulations. Several studies have recently addressed this issue for panel unit-root tests using a common factor structure to model the cross-sectional dependence, but not much work has been done yet for panel no-cointegration tests. This paper proposes a model for panel no-cointegration using an unobserved common factor structure, following the study by Bai and Ng [Econometrica (2004), Vol. 72, pp. 1127-1177] for panel unit roots. We distinguish two important cases: (i) the case when the non-stationarity in the data is driven by a reduced number of common stochastic trends, and (ii) the case where we have common and idiosyncratic stochastic trends present in the data. We discuss the homogeneity restrictions on the cointegrating vectors resulting from the presence of common factor cointegration. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behaviour of some existing residual-based panel no-cointegration tests, as suggested by Kao [Journal of Econometrics (1999), Vol. 90, pp. 1-44] and Pedroni [Econometric Theory (2004a), Vol. 20, pp. 597-625]. Under the data-generating processes (DGP) used, the test statistics are no longer asymptotically normal, and convergence occurs at rate T rather than root NT as for independent panels.

When a dynamic model is affected by a structural break, the new tests allow for detecting which frequencies of the data are responsible for parameter instability. If the model is locally stable at the frequencies of interest, the whole sample size can then be exploited despite the presence of a break. The methodology is applied to analyse the productivity slowdown in the US, and the outcome is that local stability concerns only the higher frequencies of data on consumption, investment and output.",,"STRUCTURAL-CHANGE,TIME-SERIES,DIRECTIONS,DOMAIN,BREAKS,RANK","Candelon, Bertrand@Univ Maastricht, Dept Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands@Univ Tor Vergata, Dipartimento SEFeMEQ, Rome, Italy::Cubadda, Gianluca@Univ Maastricht, Dept Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands@Univ Tor Vergata, Dipartimento SEFeMEQ, Rome, Italy","Candelon, Bertrand@Maastricht University@University of Rome Tor Vergata::Cubadda, Gianluca@Maastricht University@University of Rome Tor Vergata","CUBADDA, Gianluca@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4005-3698","Testing for the cointegration rank when some cointegrating directions are changing+Andrade, P; Bruneau, C; Gregoir, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 2005::TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::no title+BAI J+ANN ECON FINANC+2000::Multiple structural change models: a simulation study+Bai, J.; Perron, P.+Econometric theory and practice: Frontiers of analysis and applied research+2006::Computation and analysis of multiple structural change models+Bai, J; Perron, P+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 2003::Testing for and dating common breaks in multivariate time series+Bai, J; Lumsdaine, RL; Stock, JH+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1998::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::Testing for short- and long-run causality: A frequency-domain approach+Breitung, Jorg; Candelon, Bertrand+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2006::On the reliability of Chow-type tests for parameter constancy in multivariate dynamic models+Candelon, B; Lutkepohl, H+ECONOMICS LETTERS+NOV 2001::Measuring the business cycle effects of permanent and transitory shocks in cointegrated time series+Centoni, M; Cubadda, G+ECONOMICS LETTERS+JUL 2003::TESTS OF EQUALITY BETWEEN SETS OF COEFFICIENTS IN 2 LINEAR REGRESSIONS+CHOW, GC+ECONOMETRICA+1960::Maximum likelihood in the frequency domain: the importance of time-to-plan+Christiano, LJ; Vigfusson, RJ+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 2003::Complex reduced rank models for seasonally cointegrated time series+Cubadda, G+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+SEP 2001::Testing structural stability with endogenous breakpoint - A size comparison of analytic and bootstrap procedures+Diebold, FX; Chen, C+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 1996::no title+DOORNIK, J.

The MC approach allows us to introduce a new test that differs in two respects from the tests existing in the literature. First, the test is exact in the sense that the probability of rejecting the null when it is true is always less than or equal to the nominal size of the test. Secondly, the test is not based on an auxiliary regression obtained by replacing the model under the alternative by approximations based on a Taylor expansion. We also apply MC testing methods for size correcting the test proposed by Luukkonen, Saikkonen and Terasvirta (Biometrika, Vol. 75, 1988, p. 491).

We show how the joint use of these tests in levels and first differences allows the researcher to distinguish between series that are converging and series that have already converged, and we set out a strategy to establish whether convergence occurs in relative prices or just in rates of inflation. Special attention is paid to the issue of whether a mean should be extracted in carrying out tests in first differences and whether there is an advantage to adopting a (Dickey-Fuller) unit-root test based on deviations from the last observation. The asymptotic distribution of this last test statistic is given and Monte Carlo simulation experiments show that the test yields considerable power gains for highly persistent autoregressive processes with 'relatively large' initial conditions.

Explaining US-UK interest rate differentials: A reassessment of the uncovered interest rate parity in a Bayesian framework,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00461.x,2006,23,3,"In this paper, we test the uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP), allowing for transitory deviations from it. These deviations may arise from variations in risk premia, errors in expectations and linearization errors, and are modelled as a zero-mean noise around the restrictions implied by the UIRP on a vector autoregression (VAR) in the interest rate differential and the spot exchange rate. Importantly, this approach includes the traditional one as a special case, which is derived by simply setting the noise to zero. When the noise is set to zero the UIRP is rejected, but if we allow for some degree of noise the UIRP is strongly supported by the data. Thus the UIRP relation does not hold exactly, but on average, with a stationary risk premium as opposed to a constant one. This result implies that analysing the effects of policy experiments under the null of the UIRP may be both safe and useful.",,"FOREIGN-EXCHANGE,TERM STRUCTURE,RISK,PREMIUMS","Carriero, Andrea@Univ Bocconi, IGIER, Milan, Italy","Carriero, Andrea@Bocconi University","CARRIERO, ANDREA@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4409-2870","Uncovered Interest Parity Revised+Alexius, A.+Review of International Economics+2001::The forward premium anomaly is not as bad as you think+Baillie, RT; Bollerslev, T+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+AUG 2000::ON BIASES IN THE MEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RISK PREMIUMS+BEKAERT, G; HODRICK, RJ+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+APR 1993::no title+BEKAERT G+NBER WORKIGN PAPER+2002::no title+CARRIERO A+IEP BOCCONI WORKING+2005::Financial factors, macroeconomic information and the Expectations Theory of the term structure of interest rates+Carriero, A; Favero, CA; Kaminska, L+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR-APR 2006::Monetary policy and long-horizon uncovered interest parity+Chinn, MD; Meredith, G+IMF STAFF PAPERS+2004::The term structure of forward exchange premiums and the forecastability of spot exchange rates: Correcting the errors+Clarida, RH; Taylor, MP+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1997::Bond risk premia+Cochrane, JH; Piazzesi, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 2005::no title+DELNEGRO M+ECB WORKING PAPER SE+2005::NOISE TRADER RISK IN FINANCIAL-MARKETS+DELONG, JB; SHLEIFER, A; SUMMERS, LH; et al.+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+AUG 1990::The Forward Discount Anomaly and the Risk Premium: A Survey of Recent Evidence+Engel, C.+Journal of Empirical Finance+1996::no title+FLOOD RP+FOREIGN EXCHANGE MAR+1994::Chartists, Fundamentalists and the Demand for Dollars+Frankel, J.

Further evidence on the statistical properties of real GNP,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00462.x,2006,50,13,"The well-known lack of power of unit-root tests has often been attributed to the short length of macroeconomic variables and also to data-generating processes (DGPs) departing from the I(1)-I(0) models. This paper shows that by using long spans of annual real gross national product (GNP) and GNP per capita (133 years), high power can be achieved, leading to the rejection of both the unit-root and the trend-stationary hypothesis. More flexible representations are then considered, namely, processes containing structural breaks (SB) and fractional orders of integration (FI). Economic justification for the presence of these features in GNP is provided. It is shown that both FI and SB formulations are in general preferred to the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) [I(1) or I(0)] formulations. As a novelty in this literature, new techniques are applied to discriminate between FI and SB. It turns out that the FI specification is preferred, implying that GNP and GNP per capita are non-stationary, highly persistent but mean-reverting series. Finally, it is shown that the results are robust when breaks in the deterministic component are allowed for in the FI model. Some macroeconomic implications of these findings are also discussed.",,"GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT,LONG-RANGE DEPENDENCE,UNIT-ROOT HYPOTHESIS,OIL-PRICE SHOCK,TIME-SERIES,STRUCTURAL-CHANGE,MEMORY PROCESSES,EFFICIENT TESTS,GREAT CRASH,MODELS","Mayoral, Laura@Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain","Mayoral, Laura@Pompeu Fabra University","mayoral, laura@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0674-6095","Aggregation, persistence and volatility in a macro model+Abadir, K; Talmain, G+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+OCT 2002::no title+BAI J+J APPL ECONOM+2006::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::THE ESTIMATION OF PREWAR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT - METHODOLOGY AND NEW EVIDENCE+BALKE, NS; GORDON, RJ+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+FEB 1989::RECURSIVE AND SEQUENTIAL-TESTS OF THE UNIT-ROOT AND TREND-BREAK HYPOTHESES - THEORY AND INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE+BANERJEE, A; LUMSDAINE, RL; STOCK, JH+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1992::Modelling structural breaks, long memory and stock market volatility: an overview+Banerjee, A; Urga, G+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV-DEC 2005::On discriminating between long-range dependence and changes in mean+Berkes, Istvan; Horvath, Lajos; Kokoszka, Piotr; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2006::THE HURST EFFECT UNDER TRENDS+BHATTACHARYA, RN; GUPTA, VK; WAYMIRE, E+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY+1983::Generating schemes for long memory processes: regimes, aggregation and linearity+Davidson, J; Sibbertsen, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 2005::no title+DEMETRESCU M+EC THEORY+2005::The uncertain unit root in real GNP: Comment+Diebold, FX; Senhadji, AS+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1996::LONG MEMORY AND PERSISTENCE IN AGGREGATE OUTPUT+DIEBOLD, FX; RUDEBUSCH, GD+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+SEP 1989::A fractional Dickey-Fuller test for unit roots+Dolado, JJ; Gonzalo, J; Mayoral, L+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2002::no title+DOLADO JJ+WORKING PAPER+2005::no title+DOLADO JJ+WORKING PAPER U POMP+2005::Unit roots in real GNP: do we know, and do we care?+Eichenbaum, M.; Christiano, L.

Leaning into the wind: A structural VAR investigation of UK monetary policy,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00133.x,OCT 2005,28,20,"This paper adapts Uhlig's [Journal of Monetary Economics (2005) forthcoming] sign restriction identification methodology to investigate the effects of UK monetary policy using a structural vector autoregression (VAR). It shows that shocks which can reasonably be described as monetary policy shocks have played only a small role in the total variation of UK monetary and macroeconomic variables. Most of the variation in UK monetary variables has been due to their systematic reaction to other macroeconomic shocks, namely non-monetary aggregate demand, aggregate supply, and oil price shocks. We also find, without imposing any long run identifying restrictions, that aggregate supply shocks have permanent effects on output.",,"UNIT ROOTS,DISTURBANCES,FLUCTUATIONS,TRANSMISSION,MODELS,RULES,REAL,G-7","Mountford, A@Univ London, Royal Holloway Coll, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Mountford, A@University of London@Royal Holloway University London",not exist,"Exchange rates and prices: Sources of sterling real exchange rate fluctuations 1973-94+Astley, MS; Garratt, A+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+SEP 2000::Systematic Monetary Policy and the Effects of Oil Price Shocks+Bernanke, B.; Gertler, M.; Watson, M.+Brookings Papers on Economic Activity+1997::THE FEDERAL-FUNDS RATE AND THE CHANNELS OF MONETARY TRANSMISSION+BERNANKE, BS; BLINDER, AS+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1992::THE DYNAMIC EFFECTS OF AGGREGATE DEMAND AND SUPPLY DISTURBANCES+BLANCHARD, OJ; QUAH, D+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1989::no title+CANOVA F+2333 CEPR+1998::On the sources of business cycles in the G-7+Canova, F; de Nicolo, G+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+JAN 2003::Monetary disturbances matter for business fluctuations in the G-7+Canova, F; De Nicolo, G+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+SEP 2002::no title+CHRISTIANO LJ+HDB MONETARY EC+1999::Monetary policy rules in practice - Some international evidence+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1998::no title+FAVERO CA+APPL MACROECONOMICS+2001::HOW WELL DOES THE IS-LM MODEL FIT POSTWAR UNITED-STATES DATA+GALI, J+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1992::A long run structural macroeconometric model of the UK+Garratt, A; Lee, K; Pesaran, MH; et al.+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+APR 2003::OIL AND THE MACROECONOMY SINCE WORLD-WAR-II+HAMILTON, JD+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1983::no title+JACOBS J+UNPUB COMP SVARS SEM+2002::Exchange rate anomalies in the industrial countries: A solution with a structural VAR approach+Kim, S; Roubini, N+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+JUN 2000::Changes in UK monetary policy: Rules and discretion in practice+King, M+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+JUN 1997::no title+LEEPER EM+BROOKINGS PAPERS EC+1996::The inexorable and mysterious tradeoff between inflation and unemployment+Mankiw, NG+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAY 2001::no title+MOUNTFORD A+3338 CEPR+2002::no title+Obstfeld, M.; Rogoff, K.+Foundations of international economics+1996::Measuring real and nominal macroeconomic shocks and their international transmission under different monetary systems+Robertson, D; Wickens, MR+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1997::UNDERSTANDING UNIT ROOTERS - A HELICOPTER TOUR+SIMS, CA; UHLIG, H+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1991::INFERENCE IN LINEAR TIME-SERIES MODELS WITH SOME UNIT ROOTS+SIMS, CA; STOCK, JH; WATSON, MW+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1990::INTERPRETING THE MACROECONOMIC TIME-SERIES FACTS - THE EFFECTS OF MONETARY-POLICY+SIMS, CA+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1992::Bayesian methods for dynamic multivariate models+Sims, CA; Zha, T+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 1998::no title+UHLIG H+DID FED SURPRISE MAR+2001::WHAT MACROECONOMISTS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT UNIT ROOTS - A BAYESIAN PERSPECTIVE+UHLIG, H+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG-OCT 1994::no title+UHLIG H+IN PRESS J MONETARY+2005"

Testing the exogeneity of Argentine devaluation and default risks in retrospect,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00135.x,OCT 2005,28,3,"This paper studies the relationship between devaluation and default risks during Argentina's convertibility regime. Before default and devaluation occurred, a harder variant of the currency regime was under discussion. An often-suggested argument among the supporters of dollarization was that the probability of default could have been reduced by removing fears of devaluation. For this to be true, default risk must be dependent on the devaluation risk. Long-run relationships and 'exogeneity' are examined using a 'cointegrating vector' system approach. The results show that only devaluation risk can be modelled on default risk. No empirical evidence is found in favour of dollarization. Moreover, these conclusions are maintained when the information set is expanded to include the Latin American risk and Argentine macroeconomic variables.",,"COINTEGRATION,INFLATION","Ahumada, HA@Di Tella Univ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina@Cent Bank Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina::Garegnani, ML@Di Tella Univ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina@Cent Bank Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Ahumada, HA@Unknow@Unknow::Garegnani, ML@Unknow@Unknow",not exist,"no title+*AC NAC CIENC BUEN+SER EST+2000::Capital Flows and Capital-Market Crises: The Simple Economics of Sudden Stops+Calvo, G.

Practical problems with reduced-rank ML estimators for cointegration parameters and a simple alternative,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00136.x,OCT 2005,19,21,Johansen's reduced-rank maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for cointegration parameters in vector error correction models is known to produce occasional extreme outliers. Using a small monetary system and German data we illustrate the practical importance of this problem. We also consider an alternative generalized least squares (GLS) system estimator which has better properties in this respect. The two estimators are compared in a small simulation study. It is found that the GLS estimator can indeed be an attractive alternative to ML estimation of cointegration parameters.,,"ERROR-CORRECTION MODELS,SYSTEMS,VECTORS,COEFFICIENTS,BOOTSTRAP,TRENDS","Bruggemann, R@Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany@European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy::Lutkepohl, H@Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany@European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy","Bruggemann, R@Humboldt University of Berlin@European University Institute::Lutkepohl, H@Humboldt University of Berlin@European University Institute",not exist,"ESTIMATION FOR PARTIALLY NONSTATIONARY MULTIVARIATE AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS+AHN, SK; REINSEL, GC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1990::COMMON NONSTATIONARY COMPONENTS OF ASSET PRICES+BOSSAERTS, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+JUN-SEP 1988::no title+CAPORALE GM+ECONOMET REV+2004::Bootstrap and asymptotic tests of long-run relationships in cointegrated systems+Fachin, S+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+SEP 2000::5 ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF ESTIMATING LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONSHIPS+GONZALO, J+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1994::Bootstrap testing linear restrictions on cointegrating vectors+Gredenhoff, M; Jacobson, T+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2001::Testing cointegrating coefficients in vector autoregressive error correction models+Hansen, G; Kim, JR; Mittnik, S+ECONOMICS LETTERS+JAN 1998::A review of methods of estimating cointegration relationships+Hargreaves, C.+Nonstationary Time Series Analysis and Cointegration+1994::no title+Johansen, S.+Likelihood-based inference in cointegrated vector autoregressive models+1995::STOCHASTIC TRENDS AND ECONOMIC-FLUCTUATIONS+KING, RG; PLOSSER, CI; STOCK, JH; et al.+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1991::no title+Lutkepohl, H; Kratzig, M.+Applied Time Series Econometrics+2004::Vector autoregressive and vector error correction models+Lutkepohl, H.+APPL TIME SERIES ECO+2004::Testing for a valid normalization of cointegrating vectors in vector autoregressive processes+Luukkonen, R; Ripatti, A; Saikkonen, P+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1999::SOME EXACT DISTRIBUTION-THEORY FOR MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATORS OF COINTEGRATING COEFFICIENTS IN ERROR-CORRECTION MODELS+PHILLIPS, PCB+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1994::OPTIMAL INFERENCE IN COINTEGRATED SYSTEMS+PHILLIPS, PCB+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1991::no title+Reinsel, GC.+Elements of multivariate time series analysis.

The external factors considered include US as well as German interest rates, and this leads to the identification of 'domestic' and 'international' models of the reaction function. The results suggest that it is the changes in the institutional arrangements rather than those in the targeting regime which have been decisive in the development of policy in this period.",,"GENERALIZED-METHOD,REAL-TIME,INFLATION,RULES,MOMENTS,MODELS","Adam, C@Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England@Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland@Univ Aix Marseille 2, GREQAM, F-13621 Aix En Provence, France::Cobham, D@Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England@Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland@Univ Aix Marseille 2, GREQAM, F-13621 Aix En Provence, France::Girardin, E@Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England@Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland@Univ Aix Marseille 2, GREQAM, F-13621 Aix En Provence, France","Adam, C@Unknow@University of St Andrews@Aix-Marseille Universite::Cobham, D@Unknow@University of St Andrews@Aix-Marseille Universite::Girardin, E@Unknow@University of St Andrews@Aix-Marseille Universite","Cobham, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8208-3716","no title+ADAM C+0116 U ST ANDR DEP E+2001::no title+ADAM C+218 U OXF DEP EC+2004::no title+ANGELONI I+5 EUR CENTR BANK+1999::no title+BALL L+INT FINANC+1999::Policy rules for open economies+Ball, L.+Monetary Policy Rules+1999::Forward looking rules for monetary policy+Batini, N.; Haldane, A.G.+Monetary Policy Rules+1999::Asset prices and monetary policy+Cecchetti, Stephen; Genburg, Henk; Lipsky, John<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wadhwani, Sushil</span>.+Geneva Report on the World Economy, no. 2+2000::Optimal monetary policy in open versus closed economies: An integrated approach+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2001::Monetary policy rules in practice - Some international evidence+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1998::The science of monetary policy: A new keynesian perspective+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+DEC 1999::Monetary policy rules and macroeconomic stability: Evidence and some theory+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2000::no title+COBHAM D+NATL I ECON REV+2002::no title+Cobham, D.+The Making of Monetary Policy in the UK, 1975-2000+2002::no title+Davidson, R.; Mackinnon, J.+Estimation and Inference in Economics+1993::no title+DENNIS R+0305 FED RES BANK SA+2003::no title+DORNBUSCH R+1804 CTR EC POL RES+1998::'Keep it real!': a real-time UK macro data set+Egginton, DM; Pick, A; Vahey, SP+ECONOMICS LETTERS+SEP 2002::no title+ENGLISH W+CONTRIBUTIONS MACROE+2003::ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES STATISTICS FOR TESTING NON-NESTED HYPOTHESES+ERICSSON, NR+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+1983::no title+GALI J+MONETARY POLICY STRA+2004::Central bankers and uncertainty+Goodhart, C.+Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin+1999::TESTING FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY IN LINEAR-MODELS+HANSEN, BE+JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING+AUG 1992::LARGE SAMPLE PROPERTIES OF GENERALIZED-METHOD OF MOMENTS ESTIMATORS+HANSEN, LP+ECONOMETRICA+1982::no title+KIRSANOVA T+SHOULD CENTRAL BANKS+2004::no title+KUTTNER KN+88 FED RES BANK NEW+1999::An optimizing IS-LM specification for monetary policy and business cycle analysis+McCallum, BT; Nelson, E+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+AUG 1999::no title+MUSCATELLI A+278 CESINFO+2000::no title+NELSON E+120 BANK ENGL+2000::U.K. Inflation in the 1970s and 1980s: The Role of Output Gap Mismeasurement+Nelson, Edward; Nikolov, Kalin.+Journal of Economics and Business+2003::The quest for prosperity without inflation+Orphanides, A+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+APR 2003::The unreliability of output-gap estimates in real time+Orphanides, A; van Norden, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 2002::Interest-rate rules in an estimated sticky-price model+Rotemberg, J.; Woodford, M.+Monetary policy rules+1999::Policy rules for inflation targeting+Rudebusch, G.; Svensson, L.+Monetary policy rules+1999::Term structure evidence on interest rate smoothing and monetary policy inertia+Rudebusch, GD+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+SEP 2002::no title+SACK B+199939 FED RES BOARD+1999::NONNESTED TESTS FOR COMPETING MODELS ESTIMATED BY GENERALIZED-METHOD OF MOMENTS+SMITH, RJ+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1992::Inflation forecast targeting: Implementing and monitoring inflation targets+Svensson, LEO+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1997::Open-economy inflation targeting+Svensson, LEO+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+FEB 2000::Discretion versus policy rules in practice+Taylor, J.

Prewhitening bias in HAC estimation,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00130.x,AUG 2005,36,119,"Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimation commonly involves the use of prewhitening filters based on simple autoregressive models. In such applications, small sample bias in the estimation of autoregressive coefficients is transmitted to the recolouring filter, leading to HAC variance estimates that can be badly biased. The present paper provides an analysis of these issues using asymptotic expansions and simulations. The approach we recommend involves the use of recursive demeaning procedures that mitigate the effects of small-sample autoregressive bias. Moreover, a commonly used restriction rule on the prewhitening estimates (that first-order autoregressive coefficient estimates, or largest eigenvalues, > 0.97 be replaced by 0.97) adversely interferes with the power of unit-root and [Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin (1992) Journal of Econometrics, Vol. 54, pp. 159-178] (KPSS) tests. We provide a new boundary condition rule that improves the size and power properties of these tests. Some illustrations of the effects of these adjustments on the size and power of KPSS testing are given. Using prewhitened HAC estimates and the new boundary condition rule, the KPSS test is consistent, in contrast to KPSS testing that uses conventional prewhitened HAC estimates [Lee, J. S.

Programme evaluation with unobserved heterogeneity and selective implementation: The Mexican PROGRESA impact on child nutrition,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00131.x,AUG 2005,47,91,"This paper considers the impact of Programa de Educacion, Salud y Alimentacion (PROGRESA), a large Mexican rural anti-poverty programme that had an evaluation sample in which overall treatment was randomly assigned to some communities but not others, on child nutrition. When we examine the impact of PROGRESA based on the presumption of randomized allocations, we find that PROGRESA had no or even a negative impact on child nutrition. However, not all children designated to receive nutritional supplements actually did so. Our preferred estimates - child fixed-effects estimates that control for unobserved heterogeneity that is correlated with access to the supplement - indicate a significantly positive and fairly substantial programme effect of the nutritional supplements on children 12-36 months. They imply an increase of about a sixth in mean growth per year for these children and a lower probability of stunting. Effects are somewhat larger for children from poorer communities but whose mothers are functionally literate. The long-term consequences of these improvements are non-trivial; its impact working through adult height alone could result in a 2.9% increase in lifetime earnings.",,"ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT,COTE-DIVOIRE,HEALTH,INCOME,DETERMINANTS,HOUSEHOLD,GROWTH,TIME,FOOD","Behrman, JR@Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA@Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA::Hoddinott, J@Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA@Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA","Behrman, JR@University of Pennsylvania@International Food Policy Research Institute::Hoddinott, J@University of Pennsylvania@International Food Policy Research Institute",not exist,"no title+ADATO M+UNPUB FINAL REPORT O+2000::no title+ALDERMAN H+IN PRESS HLTH EC GRO+2005::UNITARY VERSUS COLLECTIVE MODELS OF THE HOUSEHOLD - IS IT TIME TO SHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF+ALDERMAN, H; CHIAPPORI, PA; HADDAD, L; et al.+WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER+FEB 1995::ESTIMATING EFFECT OF TRAINING-PROGRAMS ON EARNINGS+ASHENFELTER, O+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+1978::no title+ATTANASIO O+ED CHOICES MEXICO US+2002::no title+Becker, G.

In manufacturing sectors where technology-exploiting multinationals are prevalent, the results point to the presence of nonlinear threshold effects: the productivity benefit from FDI increases with absorptive capacity until some threshold level beyond which it becomes less pronounced. But there is also a minimum absorptive capacity threshold level below which productivity spillovers from FDI are negligible or even negative. On the contrary, no evidence of productivity spillovers is found in sectors where FDI appears to be motivated by technology-sourcing considerations.",,"FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT,R-AND-D,GEOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION,DOMESTIC FIRMS,TECHNOLOGY,MODEL,PERFORMANCE,HYPOTHESIS,INNOVATION,BENEFIT","Girma, S@Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Girma, S@University of Leicester","Girma, Sourafel@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5815-1619","Sectoral spillovers and the price of land: a cost analysis+Adsera, A+REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS+SEP 2000::Do domestic firms benefit from direct foreign investment?

While the broad conclusions are consistent with the existing literature, the proposed empirical framework is not based on correlations and permits the analysis of relative groupwise synchronization under very few assumptions. The results allow us to conclude that an English-speaking club (Canada, UK, USA) is emerging in the last decades, whereas explicit and formal commitments seem to have had a relatively weaker power in determining Euro-zone (France, Germany, Italy) business cycle comovements.

Partial horizontal inequity orderings: A non-parametric approach,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00123.x,JUN 2005,30,4,"We provide a partial ordering view of horizontal inequity (HI), based on the Lorenz criterion, associated with different post-tax income distributions and a (bistochastic) non-parametric estimated benchmark distribution. As a consequence, several measures consistent with the Lorenz criterion can be rationalized. In addition, we establish the so-called HI transfer principle, which imposes a normative minimum requirement that any HI measure must satisfy. Our proposed HI ordering is consistent with this principle. Moreover, we adopt a cardinal view to decompose the total effect of a tax system into a welfare gain caused by HI-free income redistribution and a welfare loss caused by HI, without any additive decomposable restriction on the indices. Hence, more robust tests can be applied. Other decompositions in the literature are seen as particular cases.",,"INCOME-TAX TREATMENT,INEQUALITY,POVERTY,EQUITY","Rodriguez, JG@Univ Rey Juan Carlos Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain@Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Anal Econ 1, Madrid, Spain@Univ Europea Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain::Salas, R@Univ Rey Juan Carlos Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain@Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Anal Econ 1, Madrid, Spain@Univ Europea Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain::Perrote, I@Univ Rey Juan Carlos Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain@Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Anal Econ 1, Madrid, Spain@Univ Europea Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain","Rodriguez, JG@Universidad Rey Juan Carlos@Complutense University of Madrid@Unknow::Salas, R@Universidad Rey Juan Carlos@Complutense University of Madrid@Unknow::Perrote, I@Universidad Rey Juan Carlos@Complutense University of Madrid@Unknow","Salas, Rafael@E-6130-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5313-4801::RODRIGUEZ, JUAN GABRIEL@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0256-8789","REDISTRIBUTIVE EFFECT AND UNEQUAL INCOME-TAX TREATMENT+ARONSON, JR; JOHNSON, P; LAMBERT, PJ+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAR 1994::Horizontal equity and the distribution of the tax burden+ATKINSON, A.

Kernel density estimates reveal a multimodal structure of the distribution during the 1970s and early 1980s, and a tendency towards unimodality since the mid-1980s. The distribution is further analysed by a mixture of normal densities. A two well-separated component mixture fits the distributions in the 1970s and early 1980s. These two clusters tend to converge, supporting the idea of a process of catching up.

We estimate a switching regression model to allow for self-selection into agency work because of, for instance, more motivated workers being more likely to search for jobs through a THA. We find evidence in favour of the existence of self-selection in all qualification groups considered. Concerning mobility, we find that agency workers in intermediate qualification levels are less likely to experience demotions than regular workers.

Our statistics are used to test the null hypothesis that a time series displays constant trend stationarity [I(0)] behaviour against the alternative of a change in persistence either from trend stationarity to difference stationarity [I(1)], or vice versa. Representations for the limiting null distributions of the new statistics are derived and both finite-sample and asymptotic critical values are provided.

We decompose the aggregate exit probability from unemployment into calendar time and, both observed and unobserved, compositional effects. We find that changes in the inflow composition affect the cyclical fluctuations in unemployment duration only marginally. However, the long-run improvement in the quality of entrants into unemployment, notably in terms of educational attainment, mitigates the strong upward trend in this duration. This is a new result as none of the existing studies purges the trend in the aggregate outflow rate of the variation in its composition. We also conclude that in Belgium, incidence explains as much as 45% of the evolution of unemployment. Finally, the diverging evolution of unemployment across Flanders and Wallonia predominantly results from a stronger decline in the exit rates from unemployment in Wallonia.",,"DEPENDENCE,MODELS","Dejemeppe, M@Univ Catholique Louvain, Dept Econ, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium","Dejemeppe, M@Universite Catholique Louvain",not exist,"The anatomy of unemployment dynamics+Abbring, JH; van den Berg, GJ; van Ours, JC+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2002::Business cycles and compositional variation in US unemployment+Abbring, JH; van den Berg, GJ; van Ours, JC+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 2001::no title+ABBRING JH+UNPUB UNOBSERVED HET+2003::QUALITATIVE RESPONSE MODELS - A SURVEY+AMEMIYA, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+1981::MODIFIED LOGIT MODEL+AMEMIYA, T; NOLD, F+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+1975::Duration dependence and nonparametric heterogeneity: A Monte Carlo study+Baker, M; Melino, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2000::Application of the logistic function to bio-assay+Berkson, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1944::no title+CANDELON B+200029 U CATH LOUV I+2000::no title+COCKX B+EC J OXFORD+2001::no title+COCKX B+IN PRESS J APPL ECON+2005::Analysis of transition data by the minimum-chi-square method: An application to welfare spells in Belgium+Cockx, BLW+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1997::UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DYNAMICS AND PERSISTENT UNEMPLOYMENT UNDER RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS+DARBY, MR; HALTIWANGER, J; PLANT, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1985::no title+DEJEMEPPE M+200219 U CATH LOUV I+2002::no title+DELACROIX D+UNPUB HUMAN CAPITAL+2004::no title+*FOREM+ENQUETE SORTIES INSC+1995::no title+Hoel, P.

State dependence under unobserved heterogeneity is considered, where the heterogeneity may be unrelated, pseudo-related, or arbitrarily related to regressors. Three minor methodological contributions are made: interaction terms with lagged response are allowed in dynamic conditional logit; a three-stage algorithm for dynamic probit is proposed; and treating the initial response as fixed is shown to be ill-advised. The state dependence is about 0.6 x SD(error), higher for the married or junior college-educated, and lower for women in their twenties and thirties. While education increases participation, college education has negative effects for women in their forties or above. Marriage has a high negative short-term effect but a positive long-term effect.",,"STATE DEPENDENCE,HETEROGENEITY,UNEMPLOYMENT,PERSISTENCE","Lee, MJ@Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ & Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore@Korea Dev Inst, Publ Finance & Social Dev Div, Seoul, South Korea::Tae, YH@Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ & Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore@Korea Dev Inst, Publ Finance & Social Dev Div, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, MJ@Singapore Management University@Korea Development Institute::Tae, YH@Singapore Management University@Korea Development Institute",not exist,"Unemployment persistence+Arulampalam, W; Booth, AL; Taylor, MP+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 2000::Panel data+Chamberlain, G.+HDB ECONOMETRICS+1984::Panel data discrete choice models with lagged dependent variables+Honore, BE; Kyriazidou, E+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2000::State dependence, serial correlation and heterogeneity in intertemporal labor force participation of married women+Hyslop, DR+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1999::Dynamic relationships in the Australian labour market heterogeneity and state dependence+Knights, S; Harris, MN; Loundes, J+ECONOMIC RECORD+SEP 2002::no title+Lee, MJ.+Panel Data Econometrics: Methods-of-Moments and Limited Dependent Variables+2002::NEW PATTERNS OF LABOR MOBILITY - A PANEL ANALYSIS OF JOB CHANGES AND UNEMPLOYMENT+MUHLEISEN, M; ZIMMERMANN, KF+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+APR 1994::Female participation and labor market attachment in rural Canada+Phimister, E; Vera-Toscano, E; Weersink, A+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+FEB 2002::THE PERSISTENCE OF FEMALE LABOR SUPPLY - EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE AND IMPLICATIONS+SHAW, K+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SPR 1994"

The approach used here is based on a logit model that can be used when survey data on the dependent variable are misclassified.

We study the sensitivity of the estimated order to (i) whether the effective number of observations is held fixed when estimating models of different order, (ii) whether the estimate of the variance is adjusted for degrees of freedom, and (iii) how the penalty for overfitting is defined in relation to the total sample size. Simulations show that the lag length selected by both the Akaike and the Schwarz information criteria are sensitive to these parameters in finite samples. The methods that give the most precise estimates are those that hold the effective sample size fixed across models to be compared. Theoretical considerations reveal that this is indeed necessary for valid model comparisons.

Modelling and forecasting fiscal variables for the Euro area,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00140.x,2005,32,19,"In this paper, we assess the possibility of producing unbiased forecasts for fiscal variables in the Euro area by comparing a set of procedures that rely on different information sets and econometric techniques. In particular, we consider autoregressive moving average models, Vector autoregressions, small-scale semistructural models at the national and Euro area level, institutional forecasts (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), and pooling. Our small-scale models are characterized by the joint modelling of fiscal and monetary policy using simple rules, combined with equations for the evolution of all the relevant fundamentals for the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. We rank models on the basis of their forecasting performance using the mean square and mean absolute error criteria at different horizons. Overall, simple time-series methods and pooling work well and are able to deliver unbiased forecasts, or slightly upward-biased forecast for the debt-GDP dynamics. This result is mostly due to the short sample available, the robustness of simple methods to structural breaks, and to the difficulty of modelling the joint behaviour of several variables in a period of substantial institutional and economic changes. A bootstrap experiment highlights that, even when the data are generated using the estimated small-scale multi-country model, simple time-series models can produce more accurate forecasts, because of their parsimonious specification.",,"MONETARY-POLICY RULES,MACROECONOMIC STABILITY,ACCURACY","Favero, CA@Bocconi Univ, IEP, Milan, Italy@CEPR, Milan, Italy::Marcellino, M@Bocconi Univ, IEP, Milan, Italy@CEPR, Milan, Italy","Favero, CA@Bocconi University@Unknow::Marcellino, M@Bocconi University@Unknow","FAVERO, CARLO AMBROGIO@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1668-9426","Fiscal forecasting: the track record of the IMF, OECD and EC+Artis, M.; Marcellino, M.+Econometrics Journal+2001::no title+ARTIS M+OXFORD B ECON STAT+2003::no title+BANERJEE A+OXFORD B EC STAT+2006::The combination of forecasts+Bates, JM; Granger, CWJ.+Operational Research Quarterly+1969::An empirical characterization of the dynamic effects of changes in government spending and taxes on output+Blanchard, O; Perotti, R+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2002::WHY DO WE HAVE NOMINAL GOVERNMENT DEBT+BOHN, H+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+JAN 1988::Monetary policy rules in practice - Some international evidence+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1998::Monetary policy rules and macroeconomic stability: Evidence and some theory+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2000::Tests of equal forecast accuracy and encompassing for nested models+Clark, TE; McCracken, MW+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2001::COMBINING FORECASTS - A REVIEW AND ANNOTATED-BIBLIOGRAPHY+CLEMEN, RT+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1989::Pooling of forecasts+Clements, M.; Hendry, D.+Econometrics Journal+2004::no title+Clements, M.; Hendry, D.

Our leading indicators are taken from the variables in the European Central Bank's (ECB) Euro-area-wide model database, plus a set of similar variables for the US. We compare the forecasting performance of each indicator ex post with that of purely autoregressive models. We also analyse three different approaches to combining the information from several indicators. First, ex post, we discuss the use as indicators of the estimated factors from a dynamic factor model for all the indicators. Secondly, within an ex ante framework, an automated model selection procedure is applied to models with a large set of indicators. No future information is used, future values of the regressors are forecast, and the choice of the indicators is based on their past forecasting records. Finally, we consider the forecasting performance of groups of indicators and factors and methods of pooling the ex ante single-indicator or factor-based forecasts. Some sensitivity analyses are also undertaken for different forecasting horizons and weighting schemes of forecasts to assess the robustness of the results.",,MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES,"Banerjee, A@European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy@Bocconi Univ, IEP, Milan, Italy@CEPR, Milan, Italy@Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia::Marcellino, M@European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy@Bocconi Univ, IEP, Milan, Italy@CEPR, Milan, Italy@Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia::Masten, I@European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy@Bocconi Univ, IEP, Milan, Italy@CEPR, Milan, Italy@Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia","Banerjee, A@European University Institute@Bocconi University@Unknow@University of Ljubljana::Marcellino, M@European University Institute@Bocconi University@Unknow@University of Ljubljana::Masten, I@European University Institute@Bocconi University@Unknow@University of Ljubljana",not exist,"Factor forecasts for the UK+Artis, MJ; Banerjee, A; Marcellino, M+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JUL 2005::Confidence intervals for diffusion index forecasts with a large number of predictors+Bai, J.; Ng, S.+Working Paper+2003::Forecasting Macroeconomic Variables For The New Member States Of The European Union+Banerjee, A.; Marcellino, M.; Masten, I.+ECB Working Paper No. 482+2005::no title+BANERJEE A+INT J FORECASTING+2005::The combination of forecasts+Bates, JM; Granger, CWJ.+Operational Research Quarterly+1969::Constructing historical euro-zone data+Beyer, A.; Doomok, J.

Specifically, using examples of non-nested econometric models, we show that forecasts from the true (but estimated) data generating process (DGP) do not encompass forecasts from competing mis-specified models in general, particularly when the number of in-sample observations is small. Following this result, we also examine the scope for achieving gains in accuracy by combining the forecasts from the DGP and mis-specified models.",,"PREDICTIVE ABILITY,MODELS,TESTS,PRIORS","Harvey, DI@Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Newbold, P@Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Harvey, DI@University of Nottingham::Newbold, P@University of Nottingham","Harvey, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7504-6885","ON THE USEFULNESS OF MACROECONOMIC FORECASTS AS INPUTS TO FORECASTING MODELS+ASHLEY, R+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1983::COMBINATION OF FORECASTS+BATES, JM; GRANGER, CWJ+OPERATIONAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY+1969::ECONOMETRIC EVALUATION OF LINEAR MACROECONOMIC MODELS+CHONG, YY; HENDRY, DF+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+AUG 1986::Priors from general equilibrium models for vars+Del Negro, M; Schorfheide, F+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2004::THE INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OF EX ANTE FORECASTS+FAIR, RC; SHILLER, RJ+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 1989::SOME COMMENTS ON EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC FORECASTS+GRANGER, CWJ; NEWBOLD, P+APPLIED ECONOMICS+1973::IMPROVED METHODS OF COMBINING FORECASTS+GRANGER, CWJ; RAMANATHAN, R+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1984::Tests for forecast encompassing+Harvey, DI; Leybourne, SJ; Newbold, P+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1998::ON THE FORMULATION OF EMPIRICAL-MODELS IN DYNAMIC ECONOMETRICS+HENDRY, DF; RICHARD, JF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1982::SUPPLANTING THE MINNESOTA PRIOR - FORECASTING MACROECONOMIC TIME-SERIES USING REAL BUSINESS-CYCLE MODEL PRIORS+INGRAM, BF; WHITEMAN, CH+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+DEC 1994::Forecast encompassing and model evaluation+Lu, M.; Mizon, G.

The incremental predictive information associated with using theoretical new Keynesian DSGE models vs. simple linear econometric models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00145.x,2005,55,4,"In this paper we construct output gap and inflation predictions using a variety of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) sticky price models. Predictive density accuracy tests related to the test discussed in Corradi and Swanson [Journal of Econometrics (2005a), forthcoming] as well as predictive accuracy tests due to Diebold and Mariano [Journal of Business and Economic Statistics (1995), Vol. 13, pp. 253-263]; and West [Econometrica (1996), Vol. 64, pp. 1067-1084] are used to compare the alternative models. A number of simple time-series prediction models (such as autoregressive and vector autoregressive (VAR) models) are additionally used as strawman models. Given that DSGE model restrictions are routinely nested within VAR models, the addition of our strawman models allows us to indirectly assess the usefulness of imposing theoretical restrictions implied by DSGE models on unrestricted econometric models. With respect to predictive density evaluation, our results suggest that the standard sticky price model discussed in Calvo [Journal of Monetary Economics (1983), Vol. XII, pp. 383-398] is not outperformed by the same model augmented either with information or indexation, when used to predict the output gap. On the other hand, there are clear gains to using the more recent models when predicting inflation. Results based on mean square forecast error analysis are less clear-cut, although the standard sticky price model fares best at our longest forecast horizon of 3 years, it performs relatively poorly at shorter horizons. When the strawman time-series models are added to the picture, we find that the DSGE models still fare very well, often outperforming our forecast competitions, suggesting that theoretical macroeconomic restrictions yield useful additional information for forming macroeconomic forecasts.",,"BUSINESS-CYCLE MODELS,MONETARY-POLICY,FORECAST DENSITIES,BAYESIAN-APPROACH,OUTPUT,DYNAMICS,PRICES,CONSUMPTION,ECONOMIES,FRAMEWORK","Korenok, O@Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA@Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA::Swanson, NR@Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA@Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA","Korenok, O@Virginia Commonwealth University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Swanson, NR@Virginia Commonwealth University@Rutgers State University New Brunswick","Korenok, Oleg@A-8659-2009::Korenok, Oleg@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9239-0998","CREDIBLE DISINFLATION WITH STAGGERED PRICE-SETTING+BALL, L+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 1994::Monetary policy for inattentive economies+Ball, L; Mankiw, NG; Reis, R+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 2005::INSIDE THE BLACK-BOX - THE CREDIT CHANNEL OF MONETARY-POLICY TRANSMISSION+BERNANKE, BS; GERTLER, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+FAL 1995::no title+BHARDWAJ G+SIMULATION BASED SPE+2005::no title+BIERENS HJ+J ECONOMETRICS+2005::The econometric consequences of the ceteris paribus condition in economic theory+Bierens, HJ; Swanson, NR+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 2000::Some evidence on the importance of sticky prices+Bils, M; Klenow, PJ+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 2004::no title+Blinder, Alan S.; Canetti, Elie R.

Use of the KLIC is particularly attractive, as well as operationally convenient, given its equivalence with the widely used Berkowitz likelihood ratio test for the evaluation of individual density forecasts that exploits the probability integral transforms. Parallels with the comparison and combination of point forecasts are made. This and related Monte Carlo experiments help draw out properties of combined density forecasts.

Inter-industry wage differences and individual heterogeneity,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2004.103_1.x,DEC 2004,37,9,"Two well-established findings are apparent in the analyses of individual wage determination: cross-section wage equations can account for less than half of the variance in earnings and there are large and persistent inter-industry wage differentials. We explore these two empirical regularities using longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). We show that around 90% of the variation in earnings can be explained by observed and unobserved individual characteristics. However, small - but statistically significant - industry wage premia do remain, and there is also a role for a rich set of job and workplace controls.",,"INDUSTRY,UNEMPLOYMENT,VARIABLES","Carruth, A@Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Dept Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England@Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Collier, W@Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Dept Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England@Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Dickerson, A@Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Dept Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England@Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Carruth, A@University of Kent@University of Warwick::Collier, W@University of Kent@University of Warwick::Dickerson, A@University of Kent@University of Warwick","Dickerson, Andrew@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3059-0908","High wage workers and high wage firms+Abowd, JM; Kramarz, F; Margolis, DN+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1999::GIFT EXCHANGE AND EFFICIENCY-WAGE THEORY - 4 VIEWS+AKERLOF, GA+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1984::A comparison of different estimates of interindustry wage differentials: the case of Brazil+Arbache, JS+APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS+FEB 1999::Inter-industry wage differentials in Great Britain+Benito, A+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+DEC 2000::INDUSTRY CHARACTERISTICS AND INTERREGIONAL WAGE DIFFERENCES+BLACKABY, DH; MURPHY, PD+SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+MAY 1991::INSIDER POWER IN WAGE DETERMINATION+BLANCHFLOWER, DG; OSWALD, AJ; GARRETT, MD+ECONOMICA+MAY 1990::THE EMPLOYER SIZE WAGE EFFECT+BROWN, C; MEDOFF, J+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 1989::HOURLY EARNINGS IN THE UNITED-STATES - ANOTHER LOOK AT UNIONIZATION, SCHOOLING, SICKNESS, AND UNEMPLOYMENT USING PSID DATA+CHOWDHURY, G; NICKELL, S+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+1985::Industry and occupational wage patterns and theories of wage determination+Dickens, W.

This paper investigates this question using British panel data on individual employees from 1992 to 2001. It investigates hours of work adjustments to two sources of capital gain financial windfalls and real housing wealth gains. Significant reductions in hours are found for both men and women in response, in particular, to housing gains. Men appear to increase hours in response to real housing losses, whereas women reduce hours in response to real housing gains. Evidence on hours of work preferences suggests that observed adjustments are only partial responses.",,"BEHAVIOR,BRITAIN,MODEL","Henley, A@Univ Wales, Sch Business & Management, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales","Henley, A@Aberystwyth University","Henley, Andrew@M-6861-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4057-1679","[not available]+ALTONJI JG+J POLITICAL EC+1986::What makes an entrepreneur?+Blanchflower, DG; Oswald, AJ+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JAN 1998::no title+Disney, R.; Henley, A.; Jevons, D.+House price shocks, negative equity and household consumption in the UK in the 1990s+2002::Housing costs, house price shocks and savings behaviour among older households in Britain+Disney, R; Henley, A; Stears, G+REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS+SEP 2002::House prices and home owner saving behavior+Engelhardt, GV+REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS+JUN 1996::SOME EMPIRICAL ASPECTS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP+EVANS, DS; LEIGHTON, LS+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1989::AN ESTIMATED MODEL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL CHOICE UNDER LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS+EVANS, DS; JOVANOVIC, B+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+AUG 1989::A LIFE-CYCLE MODEL OF FEMALE LABOR SUPPLY+HECKMAN, JJ; MACURDY, TE+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+1980::Changes in the distribution of housing wealth in Great Britain, 1985-91+Henley, A+ECONOMICA+AUG 1998::THE CARNEGIE CONJECTURE - SOME EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE+HOLTZEAKIN, D; JOULFAIAN, D; ROSEN, HS+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1993::no title+IMBENS G+7001 NAT BUR EC RES+1999::INHERITANCE AND LABOR SUPPLY+JOULFAIAN, D; WILHELM, MO+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+FAL 1994::Self-employment and windfall gains: Evidence from the Swedish lottery+Lindh, T; Ohlsson, H+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+NOV 1996::no title+MACURDY T+LONGITUDINAL ANAL LA+1985::no title+MACURDY TE+J POLITICAL EC+1981::no title+SKINNER J+ADV EC AGING+1993::no title+TAYLOR MP+2084 CTR EC POL RES+1999::ANOMALIES - SAVING, FUNGIBILITY, AND MENTAL ACCOUNTS+THALER, RH+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+WIN 1990"

Different models are estimated, each shedding light on the relationship between the jobs promised by plants in their initial investment and their actual employment attained. On average, it is found that the plants achieve their job targets, but larger plants fall someway short. It is argued that these plants may deliberately overstate the number of jobs, and that the employment-creation claims of inward investors and economic development agencies should be treated with skepticism.",,"FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT,EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS,UNITED-STATES,UK,IMPACT,FIRM","Jones, J@Univ Newcastle Upon Tyne, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England::Wren, C@Univ Newcastle Upon Tyne, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Jones, J@Newcastle University - UK::Wren, C@Newcastle University - UK","Jones, Jonathan@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3619-0777","no title+ALDEN J+C EUR REG FRONT FRAN+1997::The location of foreign direct investment: an empirical analysis+Billington, N+APPLIED ECONOMICS+JAN 1999::no title+CRESSY R+ECON J+1996::no title+DEVEREUX MP+ROYAL EC SOC C U DUR+2001::Indirect employment effects of foreign direct investment into the UK+DRIFFIELD, N.+Bulletin of Economic Research+1999::The impact on domestic productivity of inward investment in the UK+Driffield, N+MANCHESTER SCHOOL+JAN 2001::PATTERNS OF FIRM ENTRY AND EXIT IN UNITED-STATES MANUFACTURING-INDUSTRIES+DUNNE, T; ROBERTS, MJ; SAMUELSON, L+RAND JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+WIN 1988::no title+GORG H+200137 U NOTT LEV CT+2001::Multinational companies and indigenous development: An empirical analysis+Gorg, H; Strobl, E+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+AUG 2002::no title+GORG H+MANCHESTER SCH+2003::no title+GREENAWAY D+IN PRESS EUROPEAN J+2004::Using the ARD establishment data to looking at foreign ownership and productivity in the United Kingdom+Griffith, R.+Economic Journal+1999::no title+HARRIS RID+ANAL CURRENT DTI SUP+2001::The impact of ownership changes and age effects on plant exits in UK manufacturing, 1974-1995+Harris, RID; Hassaszadeh, P+ECONOMICS LETTERS+MAY 2002::no title+HARRIS RID+NATL I ECON REV+2004::Does Inward Foreign Direct Investment Boost the Productivity of Domestic Firms?+Haskel, J.; Pereira, S.; Slaughter, M.+Discussion Paper No. 3384+2002::no title+Hill, S.; Munday, M.+The Regional Distribution of Foreign Direct Investment in the UK+1994::no title+*INV UK+OP REV 2003+2003::no title+JONES J+IN PRESS J EC GEOGRA+2004::no title+Maylor, H.+Project Management+2003::Life duration of foreign multinational subsidiaries: Evidence from UK northern manufacturing industry 1970-93+McCloughan, P; Stone, I+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION+NOV 1998::AN ECONOMETRIC-ANALYSIS OF FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED-KINGDOM+PAIN, N+SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+FEB 1993::The effect of own-firm and other-firm experience on foreign direct investment survival in the United States, 1987-92+Shaver, JM; Mitchell, W; Yeung, B+STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL+NOV 1997::The foreign-owned manufacturing sector in UK peripheral regions, 1978-1993: Restructuring and comparative performance+Stone, I; Peck, F+REGIONAL STUDIES+FEB 1996::no title+WREN C+ALL REG AID C ROYAL+2002::no title+WREN C+EUR REG SCI ASS C FI+2003::MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT+YOUNG, S; HOOD, N; PETERS, E+REGIONAL STUDIES+NOV 1994"

The algorithm, which implements Harding and Pagan's non-parametric dating methodology, allows an assessment of the uncertainty of the estimated turning points caused by filtering and can be used to construct indices of business cycle diffusion, aiming at assessing how widespread are cyclical movements throughout the economy. Its adaptation to the notion of a deviation cycle and the imposition of depth constraints are also discussed. We illustrate the algorithm with reference to the issue of dating the euro-area business cycle and analysing its characteristics, both from the classical and the growth cycle perspectives.",,"ECONOMIC TIME-SERIES,FILTERS,MODELS","Artis, M@European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy@CEPR, London, England@Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy@Univ Udine, I-33100 Udine, Italy::Marcellino, M@European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy@CEPR, London, England@Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy@Univ Udine, I-33100 Udine, Italy::Proietti, T@European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy@CEPR, London, England@Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy@Univ Udine, I-33100 Udine, Italy","Artis, M@European University Institute@Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK@Bocconi University@University of Udine::Marcellino, M@European University Institute@Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK@Bocconi University@University of Udine::Proietti, T@European University Institute@Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK@Bocconi University@University of Udine",not exist,"Measuring business cycles: Approximate band-pass filters for economic time series+Baxter, M; King, RG+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1999::Constructing historical euro-zone data+Beyer, A.; Doornik, J.

Marginal Effects for Competing Risks Models with Piecewise Constant Hazards,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2009.00551.x,AUG 2009,18,3,"In the competing risks context, the effect of a covariate on the hazard function for a particular cause may be very different from its effect on the likelihood of exiting due to that cause. The latter probability is a function of all cause-specific hazards, and thereby potentially affected by indirect effects via hazards for competing causes. We consider the effects of covariates on the cumulative probability of exiting from a particular cause. These 'marginal effects' are decomposed into direct effects via the hazard of interest and indirect effects via the hazards for competing causes. For the piecewise constant hazard specification we derive simple closed-form expressions for the marginal effects that can be computed from the standard hazard function estimates.

The relative nutrition of spouses is associated with differences in cognitive ability, independent income and asset devolution upon divorce. Female empowerment benefits child nutrition and education. Spouses' health, leisure and consumption of assignable goods show no association with differences in bargaining power. The relative nutrition and health of spouses varies across villages, but not in ways predicted by anthropological accounts of female empowerment. Bargaining variables may be weakly associated with intrahousehold welfare because surveyed households are poor and have little room for disagreement over consumption.","J16,O15","HOUSEHOLD DECISIONS,MARRIAGE MARKET,SOUTH-AFRICA,WIVES POOL,ALLOCATION,RESOURCES,HUSBANDS,ASSETS,INCOME,LABOR","Fafchamps, Marcel@Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England::Kebede, Bereket@Univ E Anglia, Sch Dev Studies, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England::Quisumbing, Agnes R.@Unknow","Fafchamps, Marcel@University of Oxford::Kebede, Bereket@University of East Anglia::Quisumbing, Agnes R.@Unknow","Kebede, Bereket@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4163-6614::Quisumbing, Agnes@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5429-1857","Tests of income pooling in household decisions+Attanasio, O; Lechene, V+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS+OCT 2002::no title+Becker, G.+A treatise on the family+1981::no title+BEVAN P+REPORT SOCIOLO UNPUB+1996::Terror as a bargaining instrument: A case study of dowry violence in rural India+Bloch, F; Rao, V+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 2002::INCOME AND OUTCOMES - A STRUCTURAL MODEL OF INTRAHOUSEHOLD ALLOCATION+BROWNING, M; BOURGUIGNON, F; CHIAPPORI, PA; et al.+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+DEC 1994::no title+CHIAPPORI PA+INTRAHOUSEHOLD RESOU+1997::Marriage market, divorce legislation, and household labor supply+Chiappori, PA; Fortin, B; Lacroix, G+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+FEB 2002::no title+Cleave, J.+African Farmers: Labor Use in the Development of Smallholder Agriculture+1974::Bride wealth and household security in rural Zimbabwe+Dekker, M; Hoogeveen, H+JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES+MAR 2002::In sickness and in health: Risk sharing within households in rural Ethiopia+Dercon, S; Krishnan, P+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+AUG 2000::Intra-household resource allocation in Ghana: The impact of the distribution of asset ownership within the household+Doss, CR+FOOD SECURITY, DIVERSIFICATION AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: REFOCUSING THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE?+1999::Grandmothers and granddaughters: Old-age pensions and intrahousehold allocation in South Africa+Duflo, E+WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW+2003::Marriage, bequest, and assortative matching in rural Ethiopia+Fafchamps, M; Quisumbing, AR+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+JAN 2005::Assets at marriage in rural Ethiopia+Fafchamps, M; Quisumbing, A+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+JUN 2005::Control and ownership of assets within rural Ethiopian households+Fafchamps, M; Quisumbing, AR+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES+AUG 2002::Social roles, human capital, and the intrahousehold division of labor: evidence from Pakistan+Fafchamps, M; Quisumbing, AR+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 2003::Household formation and marriage market+Fafchamps, Marcel; Quisumbing, Agnes R.+HDB DEV EC+2008::no title+Goldstein, M.+Chop time no friends: Intrahousehold and individual insurance mechanisms in Southern Ghana+2000::HOW SERIOUS IS THE NEGLECT OF INTRAHOUSEHOLD INEQUALITY+HADDAD, L; KANBUR, R+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+SEP 1990::Intimate partner violence among couples in 10 DHS countries: Predictors and health outcomes+Hindin, M.

In our analytics, the unrestricted model is true, but a subset of the coefficients is treated as being local-to-zero. This approach captures the practical reality that the predictive content of variables of interest is often low. We derive mean square error-minimizing weights for combining the restricted and unrestricted forecasts.

A small Monte Carlo study and a reappraisal of an empirical study by Stock and Watson [Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly (2003) Vol. 89/3, pp. 71-90] support this explanation. The Monte Carlo evidence, together with a large-sample approximation to the variance of the combining weight, also supports the popular recommendation to ignore forecast error covariances in estimating the weight.","C22,C53,E37",,"Smith, Jeremy@Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Wallis, Kenneth F.@Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Smith, Jeremy@University of Warwick::Wallis, Kenneth F.@University of Warwick","Smith, Jeremy@B-3053-2013","no title+Bartlett, M.S.+An introduction to stochastic processes with special reference to methods and applications+1955::ON THE THEORETICAL SPECIFICATION AND SAMPLING PROPERTIES OF AUTOCORRELATED TIME-SERIES+BARTLETT, MS+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1946::COMBINATION OF FORECASTS+BATES, JM; GRANGER, CWJ+OPERATIONAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY+1969::Evaluating a three-dimensional panel of point forecasts: The Bank of England Survey of External Forecasters+Boero, Gianna; Smith, Jeremy; Wallis, Kenneth F.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JUL-SEP 2008::Tests of equal forecast accuracy and encompassing for nested models+Clark, TE; McCracken, MW+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2001::Using out-of-sample mean squared prediction errors to test the martingale difference hypothesis+Clark, Todd E.; West, Kenneth D.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV-DEC 2006::COMBINING FORECASTS - A REVIEW AND ANNOTATED-BIBLIOGRAPHY+CLEMEN, RT+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+1989::LINEAR CONSTRAINTS AND THE EFFICIENCY OF COMBINED FORECASTS+CLEMEN, RT+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JAN-MAR 1986::Re-examining the Rational Expectations Hypothesis Using Panel Data on Multi-period Forecasts+Davies, Anthony; Lahiri, Kajal.+Analysis of Panels and Limited Dependent Variable Models+1999::no title+Granger, C.

We describe a method for testing a hypothesis that one observed random variable causes another. Contingent on a sufficiently strong correspondence between the two variables, an appropriately related third variable can be employed for the test. The logic of the procedure naturally suggests strong and weak grounds for rejecting the causal hypothesis. Monte Carlo results suggest that weakly grounded rejections are unreliable for small samples, but reasonably reliable for large samples. Strongly grounded rejections are highly reliable, even for small samples.","C12,C19","VECTOR AUTOREGRESSION,INFERENCE,MODEL","Bryant, Henry L.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Bessler, David A.@Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Haigh, Michael S.@Soc Gen Corp & Investment Banking, New York, NY USA","Bryant, Henry L.@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station::Bessler, David A.@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station::Haigh, Michael S.@Unknow","Bessler, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4567-9251","Modeling corn exports and exchange rates with directed graphs and statistical loss functions+Akleman, DG; Bessler, DA; Burton, DM+COMPUTATION, CAUSATION, AND DISCOVERY+1999::no title+Anderson, T.

The paper contributes to the literature by addressing the important problem of serial correlation in the stylized NKPC and developing an extended model to account for this serial correlation. Contrary to recent results indicating no role for the output gap, we find it to be a statistically significant driving variable for inflation, with this finding robust to whether the inflation expectations series used relates to individual consumers, professional forecasters or the US Fed.","E31,E58","MONETARY-POLICY RULES,FORWARD-LOOKING MODELS,MACROECONOMIC STABILITY,GENERALIZED-METHOD,DRIVE INFLATION,INTEREST-RATES,STICKY PRICES,TAYLOR RULE,DYNAMICS,OUTPUT","Zhang, Chengsi@Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China::Osborn, Denise R.@Univ Manchester, Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England::Kim, Dong Heon@Univ Manchester, Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England@Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea","Zhang, Chengsi@Renmin University of China::Osborn, Denise R.@University of Manchester::Kim, Dong Heon@Korea University@University of Manchester","Osborn, Denise@B-8692-2008","no title+ADAM KK+222 EUR CENTR BANK+2003::Do macro variables, asset markets, or surveys forecast inflation better?+Ang, Andrew; Bekaert, Geert; Wei, Min+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 2007::no title+BALL L+INT FINANC+1999::THE FEDERAL-FUNDS RATE AND THE CHANNELS OF MONETARY TRANSMISSION+BERNANKE, BS; BLINDER, AS+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1992::no title+BOIVIN J+FEDERAL RESERVE BANK+2002::STAGGERED PRICES IN A UTILITY-MAXIMIZING FRAMEWORK+CALVO, GA+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+1983::The science of monetary policy: A new keynesian perspective+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+DEC 1999::Monetary policy rules and macroeconomic stability: Evidence and some theory+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2000::Introducing: The survey of professional forecasters+Croushore, D.+Bus.

We utilize an instrumental variable estimation method to address parents' joint fertility and schooling decisions using twin births as instruments. We find no causal impact of sibship size on school enrolment. However, there is evidence for a parabolic impact of birth order where middle-born children fare worse. Sex composition of siblings matters only for female children. Our finding that birth order and sibling sex composition matter more for poorer households suggests that scarce financial resources play an important role in bringing about the sibling composition effects.","I2,J1","FAMILY-SIZE,EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT,CHILDRENS EDUCATION,QUALITY,QUANTITY,ALLOCATION,EARNINGS,TIME","Dayioglu, Meltem@Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey::Kirdar, Murat G.@Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey::Tansel, Aysit@Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany","Dayioglu, Meltem@Middle East Technical University::Kirdar, Murat G.@Middle East Technical University::Tansel, Aysit@IZA Institute Labor Economics",not exist,"New Evidence on the Causal Link Between the Quantity and Quality of Children+Angrist, J.

On the Geometry of the Instrumental Variable Estimator,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2009.00552.x,JUN 2009,6,0,"I derive the exact distribution of the exact determined instrumental variable estimator using a geometric approach. The approach provides a decomposition of the exact estimator. The results show that by geometric reasoning one may efficiently derive the distribution of the estimation error. The often striking non-normal shape of the instrumental variable estimator, in the case of weak instruments and small samples, follows intuitively by the geometry of the problem. The method allows for intuitive interpretations of how the shape of the distribution is determined by instrument quality and endogeneity. The approach can also be used when deriving the exact distribution of any ratio of stochastic variables.","C13,C30",SMALL SAMPLE PROPERTIES,"Mehlum, Halvor@Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0317 Oslo, Norway","Mehlum, Halvor@University of Oslo",not exist,"ON THE EXACT SMALL SAMPLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATOR+MADDALA, GS; JEONG, JN+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1992::RATIOS OF NORMAL VARIABLES AND RATIOS OF SUMS OF UNIFORM VARIABLES+MARSAGLIA, G+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1965::SOME FURTHER RESULTS ON THE EXACT SMALL SAMPLE PROPERTIES OF THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATOR+NELSON, CR; STARTZ, R+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1990::A geometrical analysis of the frequency distribution of the ratio between two variables+Nicholson, C+BIOMETRIKA+JAN 1941::no title+PHILLIPS PCB+HDB ECONOMETRICS+1983::More results on the exact small sample properties of the instrumental variable estimator+Woglom, G+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2001"
Beware of 'Good' Outliers and Overoptimistic Conclusions,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2009.00543.x,JUN 2009,27,12,"The main goal of this paper is to warn practitioners of the danger of neglecting outliers in regression analysis, in particular, good leverage points (i.e. points lying close to the regression hyperplane but outlying in the x-dimension). While the types of outliers which do influence regression estimates (vertical outliers and bad leverage points) have been extensively investigated, good leverage points have been largely ignored, probably because they do not affect the estimated regression parameters. However, their effect on inference is far from negligible. We propose a step-by-step procedure to identify and treat all types of outliers.

Using data from 268 democratic elections held between 1978 and 1999, I compare the effect of world growth (luck) and national growth relative to world growth (competence). Both matter, but the effect of luck is larger than the effect of competence.

Our paper extends this research by investigating how family-specific'cultural transmission' can affect fertility rates. Following Machado and Santos Silva [Journal of the American Statistical Association (2005) Vol. 100, p. 1226] and Miranda [Journal of Population Economics (2008) Vol. 21, p. 67], we estimate count data quantile regression models using the British Household Panel Survey. We find that a woman's origin-family size is positively associated with completed fertility in her destination family. A woman's country of birth also matters for her fertility. For a sub-sample of continuously partnered men and women, both partners' origin-family sizes significantly affect destination-family fertility.","I2,J1","COUNT-DATA MODELS,BIRTH-ORDER,CULTURAL TRANSMISSION,ECONOMIC-THEORY,DANISH TWIN,REGRESSION,QUANTITY,BEHAVIOR,QUALITY,EDUCATION","Booth, Alison L.@Australian Natl Univ, Econ Program, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia@Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk CO4 3SQ, Essex, England::Kee, Hiau Joo@Australian Natl Univ, Econ Program, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Booth, Alison L.@University of Essex@Australian National University::Kee, Hiau Joo@Australian National University",not exist,"An economic analysis of fertility+Becker, G.S.+Demographic and Economic Change in Developing Countries+1960::CHILD ENDOWMENTS AND QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF CHILDREN+BECKER, GS; TOMES, N+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1976::INTERACTION BETWEEN QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF CHILDREN+BECKER, GS; LEWIS, HG+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1973::A REFORMULATION OF THE ECONOMIC-THEORY OF FERTILITY+BECKER, GS; BARRO, RJ+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 1988::The economics of cultural transmission and the dynamics of preferences+Bisin, A; Verdier, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY+APR 2001::""Beyond the melting pot"": Cultural transmission, marriage, and the evolution of ethnic and religious traits+Bisin, A; Verdier, T+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 2000::The more the merrier?

Cointegration analysis can reveal the nature of vintage heterogeneity and guide the adjustment of real-time data for benchmark revisions. Affine vintage transformation functions estimated by cointegration regressions are a flexible tool, whereas differencing and rebasing work well only under certain circumstances. Inappropriate vintage transformation may cause observed revision statistics to be affected by nuisance parameters.

Although several central banks review and discuss monetary policy issues on a bi-weekly basis, there have been no attempts by analysts to construct systematic estimates of core inflation that supports such a decision-making schedule.

We use the British Household Panel Survey to investigate the interactions between voluntary additional contributions to personal pension plans (PPP) and saving in conventional forms. In particular, we test whether contributions to the PPP crowd out saving or constitute additional saving. Results suggest that not only have private pension schemes not crowded out private saving, but actually they have increased it too.","D12,D91,E21","SOCIAL-SECURITY,PRECAUTIONARY SAVINGS,WEALTH,RETIREMENT,REFORM,IRAS","Rossi, Mariacristina@Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ, I-00173 Rome, Italy","Rossi, Mariacristina@University of Rome Tor Vergata",not exist,"no title+ATTANASIO O+4900 NBER+1994::no title+ATTANASIO OP+9815 I FISC STUD+1998::The U.

Revisiting Error-Autocorrelation Correction: Common Factor Restrictions and Granger Non-Causality,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2008.00538.x,APR 2009,24,6,"The paper questions the appropriateness of the practice known as 'error-autocorrelation correcting' in linear regression, by showing that adopting an AR(1) error formulation is equivalent to assuming that the regressand does not Granger cause any of the regressors. This result is used to construct a new test for the common factor restrictions, as well as investigate - using Monte Carlo simulations - other potential sources of unreliability of inference resulting from this practice. The main conclusion is that when the Granger cause restriction is false, the ordinary least square and generalized least square estimators are biased and inconsistent, and using autocorrelation-consistent standard errors does not improve the reliability of inference.","C2,C4","METHODOLOGY,MODELS","McGuirk, Anya@SAS Inst Inc, Cary, NC 27513 USA::Spanos, Aris@Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","McGuirk, Anya@Unknow::Spanos, Aris@Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University",not exist,"Spatial Econometrics+ANSELIN, L.+A Companion to Theoretical Econometrics+2001::TESTING FOR AUTOCORRELATION IN DYNAMIC LINEAR-MODELS+BREUSCH, TS+AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS+1978::no title+Davidson, R.; Mackinnon, J.+Estimation and Inference in Economics+1993::TESTING FOR SERIAL CORRELATION IN LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION .1.+DURBIN, J; WATSON, GS+BIOMETRIKA+1950::TESTING AGAINST GENERAL AUTOREGRESSIVE AND MOVING AVERAGE ERROR MODELS WHEN REGRESSORS INCLUDE LAGGED DEPENDENT VARIABLES+GODFREY, LG+ECONOMETRICA+1978::no title+Greene, William H.+Econometric Analysis+2003::J.

We propose a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator with more efficient use of sample information. Our Monte Carlo study shows that the GMM estimator can be very imprecise and severely biased in finite samples.

Focusing on the entire wage distribution and employing recently developed semi-non-parametric tests for quantile treatment effects, our findings cast doubt on the robustness of the premium. We find that the premium is explained by selection above the median, whereas a positive premium is obtained only at very low wages.

Deviations of the actual Federal funds rate from the estimated target give simple indications of discretionary monetary policy, and the larger deviations relate to special episodes outside the current information set.

The Inflationary Consequences of a Currency Changeover on the Catering Sector: Evidence from the Michelin Red Guide,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2008.00521.x,FEB 2009,20,3,"This paper examines the inflationary consequences of a currency changeover in the catering market. Empirical evidence from the Michelin Red Guide shows that: (i) differently from restaurants in non-euro countries, restaurants in the euro area experienced abnormal price increases just after the changeover; and (ii) among restaurants in the euro area, tourist restaurants are responsible for most of the abnormal price increases. These results suggest that proposed explanations for the changeover effect, such as menu adjustment and rounding up, are only part of the story.

This paper reviews the evidence on the effects of instrument proliferation, and describes and simulates simple ways to control it. It illustrates the dangers by replicating Forbes [American Economic Review (2000) Vol. 90, pp. 869-887] on income inequality and Levine et al.

Since then, several distinct notions of encompassing have been proposed and still coexist in the literature. We describe, illustrate and connect these notions in this paper. We start with the intuitive properties of exact encompassing between estimated models and compare it with its testable counterpart, approximate encompassing. We examine these notions and their main properties within static and dynamic, parametric and non-parametric, classical and Bayesian models and estimators. Encompassing or the lack of encompassing, is also studied via the concepts of parsimonious and partial encompassing. Pseudo-true values, which are central elements in measuring and testing approximate encompassing, are defined in line with the concept of specificity between models. We also examine the role played by the data generating process in the different approaches in the literature.",,"SQUARE FORECAST ERRORS,NON-NESTED HYPOTHESES,MODEL SELECTION,TESTS,SPECIFICATION,ECONOMETRICS,EXTENSIONS,PRINCIPLE","Bontemps, Christophe@INRA, GREMAQ, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France::Mizon, Grayham E.@Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Econ Div, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England","Bontemps, Christophe@Toulouse School of Economics@Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)@Universite de Toulouse@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Mizon, Grayham E.@University of Southampton",not exist,"METHOD FOR DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN MODELS+ATKINSON, AC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1970::no title+BONTEMPS C+9523386 GREMAQ U SOC+1995::Congruence and Encompassing+Bontemps, C.; Mizon, G.

The theory for testing one parametric model against another parametric model is now well known, but the comparison of two non-parametric models, or 'crossed' Situations where a parametric model is tested against a non-parametric one, has not been treated previously. The encompassing test statistics for the four cases presented here are based on an appropriately normalized difference between an estimator of All, parameters (eventually functional), and its pseudo-true value under M(1). The specification tests for non-parametrically estimated models have meaning only when the smoothing parameter is not arbitrarily chosen, and so the window widths are calculated by ail automatic empirical method (cross-validation). As the window width determination is part of the estimation procedure, the pseudo-true window width, associated with the pseudo-true value, is defined.",,"REGRESSION,MODELS,HYPOTHESES","Bontemps, Christophe@INRA, GREMAQ, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31931 Toulouse, France::Florens, Jean-Pierre@GREMAQ & IDEI, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France::Richard, Jean-Francois@Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Bontemps, Christophe@Toulouse School of Economics@Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)@Universite de Toulouse@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)@Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Florens, Jean-Pierre@Toulouse School of Economics@Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)@Universite de Toulouse@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Richard, Jean-Francois@University of Pittsburgh@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)",not exist,"Kernel estimators of regression functions+Bierens, H.

This strong assumption has been extended by the notion of encompassing and in likelihood based model comparisons. This paper takes the latter approach and develops tests for the comparison of competing nonlinear dynamic models, focusing on the nested and overlaping cases. The null hypothesis is that the models are equally close to the data generating process (DGP), according to a certain measure of closeness. The alternative is that One model is closer to thee DGP. The models can be correctly specified or not. Their parameters can be estimated by a variety of methods, including (Pseudo) maximum likelihood and ordinary]cast squares. The tests are symmetric and directional. Their asymptotic distribution under the null is either normal ora weighted sum of chi-squared distributions, depending oil the nesting characteristics of the competing models. The comparison of nested AR models, and of nested ARMA models with GARCH errors and exogenous forcing variables (ARMAX-GARCH) are discussed as examples.",,"HYPOTHESES,REGRESSION","Marcellino, Massimiliano@European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, I-50133 Florence, Italy@Bocconi Univ, I-50133 Florence, Italy::Rossi, Barbara@Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Marcellino, Massimiliano@Bocconi University@European University Institute::Rossi, Barbara@Duke University","Rossi, Barbara@D-6756-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0410-0493","Information theory and an extension of the likelihood ratio principle+Akaike, H.+P 2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::Congruence and Encompassing+Bontemps, C.; Mizon, G.

The Fragility of Sensitivity Analysis: An Encompassing Perspective,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2008.00535.x,DEC 2008,85,2,"Robustness and fragility in Learner's sense are defined with respect to a particular coefficient over a class of models. This paper shows that inclusion of the data generation process in that class of models is neither necessary nor sufficient for robustness. This result holds even if the properly specified model has well-determined, statistically significant coefficients. The encompassing principle explains how this result can occur. Encompassing also provides a link to a more common-sense notion of robustness, which is still a desirable property empirically; and encompassing clarifies recent discussion on model averaging and the pooling of forecasts.",,"COUNTRY GROWTH REGRESSIONS,MONEY DEMAND,PARAMETER INSTABILITY,EXTREME-BOUNDS,UNITED-STATES,MODELS,TESTS,ECONOMETRICS,FORECASTS,DETERMINANTS","Ericsson, Neil R.@Fed Reserve Board, Div Int Finance, Washington, DC 20551 USA","Ericsson, Neil R.@Federal Reserve System - USA@Federal Reserve System Board of Governors",not exist,"FINANCIAL MARKET EFFECTS ON AGGREGATE MONEY DEMAND - A BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS+ALLEN, SD; CONNOLLY, RA+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+MAY 1989::TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::COMBINATION OF FORECASTS+BATES, JM; GRANGER, CWJ+OPERATIONAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY+1969::Cross-country determinants of life satisfaction: exploring different determinants across groups in society+Bjornskov, Christian; Dreher, Axel; Fischer, Justina A.

A multivariate version is introduced. Size and power are investigated in comparison with four other tests for multivariate normality.

This multivariate dynamic mixture autoregression allows for non-stationary epochs. It proves to be an appealing alternative to existing nonlinear models, e.g. the threshold autoregressive or Markov switching class of models, which are commonly used to describe nonlinear dynamics as implied by arbitrage in presence of transaction costs. Simple conditions on the parameters of the ACR process and its innovations are shown to imply geometric ergodicity, stationarity and existence of moments. Furthermore, consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimators are established. An application to real exchange rate data illustrates the analysis.",,"PURCHASING POWER PARITY,ERROR-CORRECTION MODELS,REAL EXCHANGE-RATES,UNIT-ROOT PROCESSES,NUISANCE PARAMETER,TIME-SERIES,THRESHOLD AUTOREGRESSION,STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY,NONLINEAR ADJUSTMENT,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD","Bec, Frederique@Univ Cergy Pontoise, CREST INSEE, Cergy Pontoise, France@Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Cergy Pontoise, France::Rahbek, Anders@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1455 Copenhagen K, Denmark::Shephard, Neil@Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst, Oxford, England@Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England","Bec, Frederique@University of Cergy - Pontoise::Rahbek, Anders@University of Copenhagen::Shephard, Neil@University of Oxford",not exist,"Transaction costs and non-linear adjustment towards equilibrium in the US treasury bill market+Anderson, HM+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1997::OPTIMAL TESTS WHEN A NUISANCE PARAMETER IS PRESENT ONLY UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE+ANDREWS, DWK; PLOBERGER, W+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1994::Threshold cointegration+Balke, NS; Fomby, TB+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+AUG 1997::Vector equilibrium correction models with non-linear discontinuous adjustments+Bec, F.; Rahbek, A.+Econ.

The testing problem has nuisance parameters so power studies often work with a slightly different model with a random initial value in which nuisance parameters can easily be eliminated by an invariant reduction of the model. We show that invariance arguments can also be used when comparing power within a conditional model. In the context of the conditional model, the Dickey-Fuller test is shown to be more stringent than a number of unit-root tests motivated by models with random initial value. The power of the Dickey-Fuller test can be improved by making assumptions to the initial value. The practitioner therefore has to trade-off robustness and power, as assumptions about initial values are hard to test, but can give more power.",,"COINTEGRATION ANALYSIS,INITIAL CONDITION,TIME-SERIES,HYPOTHESES,LIKELIHOOD,RANK","Nielsen, Bent@Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England","Nielsen, Bent@University of Oxford",not exist,"Testing joint hypotheses when one of the alternatives is one-sided+Abadir, Karim M.; Distaso, Walter+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 2007::SOME TESTS FOR UNIT ROOTS IN AUTOREGRESSIVE-INTEGRATED-MOVING AVERAGE MODELS WITH DETERMINISTIC TRENDS+AHN, SK+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1993::no title+ANDERSEN, P.

We show that, in general support for sustainability substantially improves when nonlinear mean reversion is taken into account. We also find that the results obtained from applying various tests with nonlinear alternatives, although broadly consistent, are not identical.

The test is general enough to allow for heteroskedastic and serially correlated errors, unit-specific time trends, cross-sectional dependence and unknown structural breaks in both the intercept and slope of the cointegrated regression, which may be located at different dates for different units. The limiting distribution of the test is derived, and is found to be normal and free of nuisance parameters under the null. A small simulation study is also conducted to investigate the small-sample properties of the test.

Technological change and transition: Relative contributions to worldwide growth during the 1990s,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2008.00508.x,AUG 2008,53,24,"In this paper we use the Kumar and Russell [American Economic Review (2002) Vol. 92, pp. 527-548] growth-accounting procedure to examine cross-country growth during the 1990s. Using a data set comprising developed, newly industrialized, developing and transitional economies, we decompose the growth of output per worker into components attributable to technological catch-up, technological change and capital accumulation. In contrast to the study by Kumar and Russell, which concludes that capital deepening is the major force of growth and change in the world income per worker distribution over the 1965-90 period, our analysis shows that, during the 1990s, the major force in the further divergence of the rich and the poor is due to technological change, whereas capital accumulation plays a lesser and opposite role. Finally, although on average we find that transitional economies perform similar to the rest of the world, the procedure is able to discover some interesting patterns within the set of transitional countries.",,"NONPARAMETRIC FRONTIER MODELS,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH,EFFICIENCY SCORES,CROSS-SECTION,CONVERGENCE,STATISTICS,COUNTRIES,DYNAMICS,INCOME","Badunenko, Oleg@DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Berlin, Germany::Henderson, Daniel J.@SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY USA::Zelenyuk, Valentin@Kyiv Sch Econ, Kiev, Ukraine","Badunenko, Oleg@DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung::Henderson, Daniel J.@State University of New York (SUNY) System@State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton::Zelenyuk, Valentin@Kyiv School of Economics","Henderson, Daniel@D-1822-2014::Henderson, Daniel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4940-9689","ECONOMIC-GROWTH IN A CROSS-SECTION OF COUNTRIES+BARRO, RJ+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1991::Disorganization+Blanchard, O; Kremer, M+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 1997::no title+Blanchard, Olivier.+The Economics of Post- Communist Transition+1997::Beyond computation: Information technology, organizational transformation and business performance+Brynjolfsson, E; Hitt, LM+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+FAL 2000::The US technology frontier+Caselli, F; Coleman, WJ+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2002::no title+CASELLI F+NBER INT SEM MACR+2004::no title+Caselli, F.+HDB EC GROWTH A+2005::The world technology frontier+Caselli, Francesco; Coleman, Wilbur John, II+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2006::Spillover effects of FDI on innovation in China: Evidence from the provincial data+Cheung, KY; Lin, P+CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW+2004::no title+Chow, G.C.+China's economic transformation+2002::The law of one price for transitional Ukraine+Cushman, DO; MacDonald, R; Samborsky, M+ECONOMICS LETTERS+NOV 2001::The New Economy in Europe, 1992-2001+Daveri, F+OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY+FAL 2002::PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH, CONVERGENCE, AND WELFARE - COMMENT+DELONG, JB+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1988::CAPITAL AND THE THEORY OF PRODUCTIVITY-MEASUREMENT+DIEWERT, WE+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1980::On goodness-of-fit tests for weakly dependent processes using kernel method+Fan, YQ; Ullah, A+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+1999::Productivity growth and convergence in the European Union+Fare, R; Grosskopf, S; Margaritis, D+JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY ANALYSIS+APR 2006::Productivity growth, technical progress, and efficiency change in industrialized countries+Fare, R.; Grosskopf, S.; Norris, M.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Zhang, Z</span>.+The American Economic Review+1994::Adjusting to a new technology: Experience and training+Helpman, E; Rangel, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH+DEC 1999::Testing for (efficiency) catching-up+Henderson, Daniel J.; Zelenyuk, Valentin+SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL+APR 2007::Human capital and convergence: A production-frontier approach+Henderson, DJ; Russell, RR+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 2005::no title+Heston, A.; Summers, R.; Aten, B.+Penn World Table+2002::no title+Huber, P.

Measuring financial contagion using time-aligned data: The importance of the speed of transmission of shocks,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2008.00509.x,AUG 2008,17,11,"This paper presents a new empirical approach to address the problem of trading time differences between markets in studies of financial contagion. In contrast to end-of-business-day data common to most contagion studies, we employ price observations, which are exactly aligned in time to correct for time-zone and end-of-business-day differences between markets. Additionally, we allow for time lags between price observations in order to test the assumption that the shock is not immediately transmitted from one market to the other. Our analysis of the financial turmoil surrounding the Asian crisis reveals that such corrections have an important bearing on the evidence for contagion, independent of the methodology employed. Using a correlation-based test, we find more contagion the faster we assume the shock to be transmitted.",,"INTERDEPENDENCE,BOOTSTRAP","Kleimeier, Stefanie@Maastricht Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Limburg Inst Financial Econ, NL-6225 LM Maastricht, Netherlands::Lehnert, Thorsten@Maastricht Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Limburg Inst Financial Econ, NL-6225 LM Maastricht, Netherlands@Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Sch Management, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands::Verschoor, Willem F.

A bootstrap method for identifying and evaluating a structural vector autoregression,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00496.x,AUG 2008,32,15,"Graph-theoretic methods of causal search based on the ideas of Pearl (2000), Spirtes et al. (2000), and others have been applied by a number of researchers to economic data, particularly by Swanson and Granger (1997) to the problem of finding a data-based contemporaneous causal order for the structural vector autoregression, rather than, as is typically done, assuming a weakly justified Choleski order. Demiralp and Hoover (2003) provided Monte Carlo evidence that such methods were effective, provided that signal strengths were sufficiently high. Unfortunately, in applications to actual data, such Monte Carlo simulations are of limited value, as the causal structure of the true data-generating process is necessarily unknown. In this paper, we present a bootstrap procedure that can be applied to actual data (i.e. without knowledge of the true causal structure). We show with an applied example and a simulation study that the procedure is an effective tool for assessing our confidence in causal orders identified by graph-theoretic search algorithms.",,"DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS,MARKETS,MODEL","Demiralp, Selva@Koc Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey::Hoover, Kevin D.@Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA::Perez, Stephen J.@Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Econ, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA","Demiralp, Selva@Koc University::Hoover, Kevin D.@Duke University::Perez, Stephen J.@California State University Sacramento@California State University System","Demiralp, Selva@L-6650-2016","THE DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF THE KLEIN-GOLDBERGER MODEL+ADELMAN, I; ADELMAN, FL+ECONOMETRICA+1959::Modeling corn exports and exchange rates with directed graphs and statistical loss functions+Akleman, DG; Bessler, DA; Burton, DM+COMPUTATION, CAUSATION, AND DISCOVERY+1999::Export-led growth and the Japanese economy: evidence from VAR and directed acyclic graphs+Awokuse, TO+APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS+NOV 15 2005::Measuring monetary policy+Bernanke, BS; Mihov, I+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1998::Money and prices: U.

Within this framework, two propositions are set. In the union sector seniority should be an important determinant of wages, while in the non-union sector productivity, proxied by occupational experience, should have a key role on earning profiles. The empirical analysis verifies both propositions. Seniority earning profiles appear to be steeper in the union sector, while occupational expertise is estimated to have a more significant role in non-union jobs.",,"LABOR-MARKET,JOB SENIORITY,TRADE-UNIONS,WAGES RISE,EARNINGS,BRITAIN,DECLINE,TENURE,MODEL,STRATEGIES","Zangelidis, Alexandros@Univ Aberdeen, Ctr European Labour Market Res, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland","Zangelidis, Alexandros@University of Aberdeen","Zangelidis, Alexandros@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4359-8933","JOB DURATION, SENIORITY, AND EARNINGS+ABRAHAM, KG; FARBER, HS+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1987::no title+ADAMS RJ+IND RELAT+1974::Employee training and wage compression in Britain+Almeida-Santos, F; Mumford, K+MANCHESTER SCHOOL+JUN 2005::DO WAGES RISE WITH JOB SENIORITY+ALTONJI, JG; SHAKOTKO, RA+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1987::no title+ARABSHEIBANI GR+20015 U WAL SCH MAN+2001::Training and labour market flexibility: Is there a trade-off?+Arulampalam, W; Booth, AL+BRITISH JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS+DEC 1998::New employee relations strategies in Britain: Towards individualism or partnership?+Bacon, N; Storey, J+BRITISH JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS+SEP 2000::no title+BARTH E+2142 IZA+2006::no title+BOHEIM R+IND RELAT+2003::Seniority, earnings and unions+Booth, AL; Frank, J+ECONOMICA+NOV 1996::Unions, work-related training and wages: Evidence for British men+Booth, AL; Francesconi, M; Zoega, G+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+OCT 2003::JOB-RELATED FORMAL TRAINING - WHO RECEIVES IT AND WHAT IS IT WORTH+BOOTH, AL+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1991::Firms' choice of method of pay+Brown, C.+Industrial Labor Relations Review+1990::no title+Brown, W.; Deakin, S.; Hudson, M.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Pratten, C.; Ryan, P</span>.+The Individualisation of Employment Contracts in Britain+1998::FIRM-SPECIFIC HUMAN-CAPITAL AND PROMOTION LADDERS+CARMICHAEL, L+BELL JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+1983::Why do non-union employees want to unionize?

If effective, this would not only reduce Germany's persistently high unemployment rate, but also increase its notoriously low self-employment rate. Empirical evidence on the effectiveness of such programmes is scarce. We evaluate the effectiveness of two start-up programmes for the unemployed, where we include the probability of being employed, the probability of being unemployed and personal income as outcome variables. Our results show that at the end of the observation period, both programmes are effective. The considerable positive effects present a stark contrast to findings from evaluations of other German ALMP programmes in recent years. Hence, ALMP programmes aimed at moving the unemployed into self-employment may prove to be among the most effective, both in Germany and elsewhere.",,"PROPENSITY SCORE,SELECTION,EARNINGS,DENSITY,MODELS","Baumgartner, Hans J.@DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany::Caliendo, Marco@Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany@IAB, Nurnberg, Germany","Baumgartner, Hans J.@DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung::Caliendo, Marco@IZA Institute Labor Economics",not exist,"no title+ABADIE A+FAILURE BOOTSTRAP MA+2006::no title+BIEWEN M+EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS S+2006::How robust is the evidence on the effects of college quality?

We find, first, that deaths of prime-age adults significantly increase both male and female adolescents' labour force participation as they stop their schooling. Secondly, the death of prime-age adults in general also decreases school enrolment ex ante. Thirdly, female adults tend to join the labour force following the death of prime-age adult males.

We find complementarity between internal and external R&D, with a positive impact of external R&D only evident in case of sufficient internal R&D.

Inequality and crime: Separating the effects of permanent and transitory income,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00492.x,APR 2008,43,15,"Earlier studies on income inequality and crime have typically used total income or total earnings. However, it is quite likely that it is the changes in permanent rather than in transitory income that affects crime rates. The purpose of this paper is therefore to disentangle the two effects by, first, estimating region-specific inequality in permanent and transitory income and, second, estimating crime equations with the two separate income components as explanatory variables. The results indicate that it is important to separate the two effects; while an increase in the inequality in permanent income yields a positive and significant effect on total crimes and three different property crimes, an increase in the inequality in transitory income has no significant effect. Using a traditional, aggregate, measure of income yields insignificant effects on crime.",,"COVARIANCE STRUCTURE,EARNINGS INEQUALITY,UNEMPLOYMENT,EVOLUTION,DYNAMICS","Dahlberg, Matz@Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden::Gustavsson, Magnus@Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden","Dahlberg, Matz@Uppsala University::Gustavsson, Magnus@Uppsala University",not exist,"ON THE COVARIANCE STRUCTURE OF EARNINGS AND HOURS CHANGES+ABOWD, JM; CARD, D+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1989::Small-sample bias in GMM estimation of covariance structures+Altonji, JG; Segal, LM+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1996::no title+BAKER M+J LABOR ECON+1997::Earnings dynamics and inequality among Canadian men, 1976-1992: Evidence from longitudinal income tax records+Baker, M; Solon, G+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+APR 2003::CRIME AND PUNISHMENT - ECONOMIC APPROACH+BECKER, GS+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1968::How much should we trust differences-in-differences estimates?+Bertrand, M; Duflo, E; Mullainathan, S+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2004::THE COST OF INEQUALITY - METROPOLITAN STRUCTURE AND VIOLENT CRIME+BLAU, JR; BLAU, PM+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+1982::Crime as a social cost of poverty and inequality: a review focusing on developing countries+Bourguignon, F.+Facets of Globalization, International and Local Dimensions of Development, World Bank Discussion Paper No. 415+2001::no title+Cameron, C; Trivedi, P.+Microeconometrics: Methods and applications+2005::The dynamics and inequality of Italian men's earnings - Long-term changes or transitory fluctuations?+Cappellari, L+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SPR 2004::Panel data+Chamberlain, G.+HDB ECONOMETRICS+1984::Income variables and the measures of gains from crime+Chisholm, J; Choe, C+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 2005::Burglary and income inequality+Chiu, WH; Madden, P+JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS+JUL 1998::Small-sample properties of estimators of nonlinear models of covariance structure+Clark, TE+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1996::no title+DAHLBERG M+200519 I LAB MARK PO+2005::Crime and local inequality in South Africa+Demombynes, G; Ozler, B+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+APR 2005::The evolution of individual male earnings in Great Britain: 1975-95+Dickens, R+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JAN 2000::The impact of legalized abortion on crime+Donohue, JJ; Levitt, SD+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 2001::The Swedish wage structure: The rise and fall of solidarity wage policy+Edin, P.

Pricing-to-market and market structure,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00493.x,APR 2008,56,13,"Stimulated by imperfect competition/sticky prices framework of the new open economy macroeconomics, empirical research has reconsidered the role of exchange rates in international adjustment. This paper reassesses the link between exchange rates and traded good prices by estimating pricing-to-market equations for the five main euro area countries over the period 1990-99. We minimize selection biases by keeping all manufacturing products and all destination markets and show that exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) is much larger, almost complete, than previously estimated. Thanks to a huge variability in terms of exchange rate variations, products and destination markets, we can map differences in ERPT into market structures and, at the same time, reconcile our results with the empirical literature. We find that ERPT is highly incomplete for sales by oligopolistic industries into advanced economies, indeed in the order of 50-60% as previously estimated. ERPT is instead almost complete in emerging and developing economies where therefore exchange rate movements can help adjust external imbalances. We also find that ERPT is largely asymmetric: it is almost complete after an appreciation of the exporter's currency, rather incomplete after a depreciation. This result is very robust across specifications.",,"RATE PASS-THROUGH,REAL EXCHANGE-RATE,UNITED-STATES,FOREIGN-EXCHANGE,DOMESTIC PRICES,IMPORT PRICES,EURO AREA,ADJUSTMENT,RATES,SHARE","Bugamelli, Matteo@Banca Italia, Res Dept, Rome, Italy::Tedeschi, Roberto@Banca Italia, Res Dept, Rome, Italy","Bugamelli, Matteo@Unknow::Tedeschi, Roberto@Unknow",not exist,"Export price responses to exogenous exchange rate movements+Adolfson, M+ECONOMICS LETTERS+APR 2001::no title+ALTERMAN W+INT EC T ISSSUES MEA+1991::HYSTERESIS IN IMPORT PRICES - THE BEACHHEAD EFFECT+BALDWIN, R+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1988::no title+BALDWIN RE+NBER WORKING PAPER S+1989::ASYMMETRIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT AND ECONOMIC-FLUCTUATIONS+BALL, L;

Following Miller and Modigliani [Journal of Business (1961), Vol. 34, pp. 411-433] we construct a cashflow yield that includes both dividend and non-dividend cashflows to shareholders. Using a data set covering the course of the 20th century, we show in a cointegrating vector autoregression framework that this measure has strong and stable predictive power for returns. The weak predictive power of standard measures of the dividend yield is explained by the strong rejection of the implied cointegrating and causality restrictions on the impact of non-dividend cashflows.",,"SHARE REPURCHASES,DIVIDEND YIELDS,STOCK RETURNS,SHAREHOLDERS,MODELS,RATIOS,PREDICTABILITY,HYPOTHESIS,VOLATILITY,VALUATION","Alessandri, Piergiorgio@Bank England, London EC2R 8AH, England::Robertson, Donald@Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England::Wright, Stephen@Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, London W1E 7HX, England","Alessandri, Piergiorgio@Bank of England::Robertson, Donald@University of Cambridge::Wright, Stephen@University of London@Birkbeck University London",not exist,"STOCK-PRICE VOLATILITY, ORDINARY DIVIDENDS, AND OTHER CASH FLOWS TO SHAREHOLDERS+ACKERT, LF; SMITH, BF+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+SEP 1993::CASH DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS+BAGWELL, LS; SHOVEN, JB+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+SUM 1989::Implementing statistical criteria to select return forecasting models: What do we learn?+Bossaerts, P; Hillion, P+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+SUM 1999::On the importance of measuring payout yield: Implications for empirical asset pricing+Boudoukh, Jacob; Michaely, Roni; Richardson, Matthew; et al.+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+APR 2007::Efficient tests of stock return predictability+Campbell, John Y.; Yogo, Motohiro+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JUL 2006::The Dividend-Price Ratio and Expectations of Future Dividends and Discount Factors+Campbell, John Y.; Shiller, Robert J.+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+JUL 1988::Valuation ratios and the long run stock market outlook+Campbell, JY; Shiller, RJ+JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT+WIN 1998::no title+Cochrane, J.+Asset Pricing+2001::no title+DAVIDSON R+58 DARP+2001::Disappearing dividends: changing firm characteristics or lower propensity to pay?+Fama, EF; French, KR+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+APR 2001::DIVIDEND YIELDS AND EXPECTED STOCK RETURNS+FAMA, EF; FRENCH, KR+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+OCT 1988::Assessing goodness-of-fit of asset pricing models: The distribution of the maximal R-2+Foster, FD; Smith, T; Whaley, RE+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUN 1997::no title+FRANKLIN A+CORPORATE FINANCE A+2003::TESTING THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF DIVIDEND YIELDS+GOETZMANN, WN; JORION, P+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUN 1993::Predicting the equity premium with dividend ratios+Goyal, A; Welch, I+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+MAY 2003::Dividends, share repurchases, and the substitution hypothesis+Grullon, G; Michaely, R+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+AUG 2002::EVIDENCE OF PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR OF SECURITY RETURNS+JEGADEESH, N+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUL 1990::An empirical test of the accounting-based residual income model and the traditional dividend discount model+Jiang, XQ; Lee, BS+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+JUL 2005::A Bartlett correction factor for tests on the cointegrating relations+Johansen, S+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+OCT 2000::ESTIMATION AND HYPOTHESIS-TESTING OF COINTEGRATION VECTORS IN GAUSSIAN VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS+JOHANSEN, S+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1991::STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF COINTEGRATION VECTORS+JOHANSEN, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+JUN-SEP 1988::Measuring the predictable variation in stock and bond returns+Kirby, C+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+FAL 1997::Time-series behavior of share repurchases and dividends+Lee, Bong-Soo; Rui, Oliver Meng+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS+MAR 2007::Predicting returns with financial ratios+Lewellen, J+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+NOV 2004::no title+LIANG JN+SHARE REPURCHASES EM+1999::On the volatility of stock prices: an exercise in quantitative theory+Mehra, R+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE+NOV 1998::DIVIDEND POLICY, GROWTH, AND THE VALUATION OF SHARES+MILLER, MH; MODIGLIANI, F+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+1961::no title+MILLER MH+STABILISATION POLICI+1963::PREDICTABLE STOCK RETURNS - THE ROLE OF SMALL SAMPLE BIAS+NELSON, CR; KIM, MJ+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUN 1993::PREDICTABILITY OF STACK RETURNS - ROBUSTNESS AND ECONOMIC-SIGNIFICANCE+PESARAN, MH; TIMMERMANN, A+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+SEP 1995::Dividends, total cash flow to shareholders, and predictive return regressions+Robertson, D; Wright, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2006::Predictive regressions+Stambaugh, RF+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+DEC 1999::no title+*US CENS BUR+HIST STAT US COL TIM+1977::Measures of stock market value and returns for the US nonfinancial corporate sector, 1900-2002+Wright, S+REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH+DEC 2004"

These studies typically use self-reported measures from surveys, often characterized by measurement error. This paper is the first validation study of access to markets data. Unique data from Peru allow comparison of self-reported variables with scientifically calculated variables. We investigate the determinants of the deviation between imputed and self-reported data and show that it is non-classical and dependent on observable socio-economic variables.

Panel stationarity test with structural breaks,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2008.00502.x,APR 2008,36,35,"In this paper, we extend the heterogeneous panel data stationarity test of Hadri [Econometrics Journal, Vol. 3 (2000) pp. 148-161] to the cases where breaks are taken into account. Four models with different patterns of breaks under the null hypothesis are specified. Two of the models have been already proposed by Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. [Econometrics Journal, Vol. 8 (2005) pp. 159-175]. The moments of the statistics corresponding to the four models are derived in closed form via characteristic functions. We also provide the exact moments of a modified statistic that do not asymptotically depend on the location of the break point under the null hypothesis. The cases where the break point is unknown are also considered. For the model with breaks in the level and no time trend and for the model with breaks in the level and in the time trend, Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. [Econometrics Journal, Vol. 8 (2005) pp. 159-175] showed that the number of breaks and their positions may be allowed to differ across individuals for cases with known and unknown breaks. Their results can easily be extended to the proposed modified statistic. The asymptotic distributions of all the statistics proposed are derived under the null hypothesis and are shown to be normally distributed. We show by simulations that our suggested tests have in general good performance in finite samples except the modified test. In an empirical application to the consumer prices of 22 OECD countries during the period from 1953 to 2003, we found evidence of stationarity once a structural break and cross-sectional dependence are accommodated.",,"UNIT-ROOT TESTS,PURCHASING POWER PARITY,SERIES,BIAS,COINTEGRATION,HYPOTHESIS,FINITE,NULL","Hadri, Kaddour@Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham Business Sch, Durham DH1 3HY, England::Rao, Yao@Univ Liverpool, Dept Econ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L69 72H, Merseyside, England","Hadri, Kaddour@Durham University::Rao, Yao@University of Liverpool",not exist,"no title+ABADIR KM+B ECON RES+2000::OLS BIAS IN A NONSTATIONARY AUTOREGRESSION+ABADIR, KM+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+MAR 1993::AN LM TEST FOR A UNIT-ROOT IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRUCTURAL-CHANGE+AMSLER, C; LEE, JS+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 1995::Estimation of a change point in multiple regression models+Bai, J+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1997::Least squares estimation of a shift in linear processes+Bai, Jushan.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1994::no title+Baltagi, Badi.

This paper quantifies the biases in parameter estimation and size distortions of hypothesis tests of overlapping linear and polynomial autoregressions, which have been used in target-zone applications. We show that both estimation bias and size distortions of hypothesis tests are generally larger, if the amount of overlap is larger, the sample size is smaller, and autoregressive root of the data-generating process is closer to unity. In particular, the estimates are biased in a way that makes it more likely that the predictions of the Bertola-Svensson model will be supported. Size distortions of various tests also turn out to be substantial even when using a heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation-consistent covariance matrix.",,"EXCHANGE-RATE,REALIGNMENT EXPECTATIONS,TIME-SERIES,DEVALUATION EXPECTATIONS,MEAN REVERSION,STOCK RETURNS,UNIT-ROOT,MODELS,CREDIBILITY,EMS","Darvas, Zsolt@Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Math Econ & Econ Anal, Budapest, Hungary","Darvas, Zsolt@Corvinus University Budapest",not exist,"Stock return predictability: Is it there?+Ang, Andrew; Bekaert, Geert+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+MAY 2007::STOCHASTIC DEVALUATION RISK AND THE EMPIRICAL FIT OF TARGET-ZONE MODELS+BERTOLA, G; SVENSSON, LEO+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1993::no title+BRITTENJONES M+4156 EFA+2004::FRENCH-GERMAN INTEREST-RATE DIFFERENTIALS AND TIME-VARYING REALIGNMENT RISK+CARAMAZZA, F+INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND STAFF PAPERS+SEP 1993::The determinants of realignment expectations under the EMS: Some empirical regularities+Chen, ZH; Giovannini, A+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1997::DISTRIBUTION OF THE ESTIMATORS FOR AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES WITH A UNIT ROOT+DICKEY, DA; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY COMPONENTS OF STOCK-PRICES+FAMA, EF; FRENCH, KR+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+APR 1988::THE EUROPEAN MONETARY-SYSTEM - CREDIBLE AT LAST+FRANKEL, J; PHILLIPS, S+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+OCT 1992::Empirical research on nominal exchange rates+Frankel, J.

We introduce mechanisms that allow for increasing or diminishing phase shifts and for time-varying association patterns in different cycles. Standard Kalman filter techniques are used to estimate the parameters simultaneously by maximum likelihood. The empirical illustrations are based on gross domestic product (GDP) series of seven European countries that are compared with the GDP series of the Euro area and that of the US. The original integrated time series are band-pass filtered.

Testing the New Keynesian Phillips curve through vector autoregressive models: Results from the Euro area,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00490.x,FEB 2008,35,24,"This paper addresses the issue of testing the 'hybrid' New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) through vector autoregressive (VAR) systems and likelihood methods, giving special emphasis to the case where the variables are non-stationary. The idea is to use a VAR for both the inflation rate and the explanatory variable(s) to approximate the dynamics of the system and derive testable restrictions. Attention is focused on the 'inexact' formulation of the NKPC. Empirical results over the period 1971-98 show that the NKPC is far from providing a 'good first approximation' of inflation dynamics in the Euro area.",,"FORWARD-LOOKING MODELS,RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS,INFLATION DYNAMICS,IDENTIFICATION,ECONOMICS,PRICES,UK","Fanelli, Luca@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy","Fanelli, Luca@University of Bologna",not exist,"Econometric evaluation of the New Keynesian Phillips curve+Bardsen, G; Jansen, ES; Nymoen, R+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+SEP 2004::An open-economy new Keynesian Phillips curve for the UK+Batini, N; Jackson, B; Nickell, S+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+SEP 2005::The New Keynesian Phillips Curve for a Small Open Economy+Boug, P; Cappelen, A.; Swensen, A.R.+Discussion Paper No. 460+2006::STAGGERED PRICES IN A UTILITY-MAXIMIZING FRAMEWORK+CALVO, GA+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+1983::COINTEGRATION AND TESTS OF PRESENT VALUE MODELS+CAMPBELL, JY; SHILLER, RJ+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 1987::Is there a unit root in the inflation rate?

Land sales and rental markets in transition: Evidence from rural Vietnam,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00484.x,FEB 2008,75,47,Impact and desirability of land transfers in post-socialist-transition economies have been subject of considerable debate. We use data from Vietnam to identify factors conducive to the development of land markets and to assess potentially differential impacts of rental and sales. Results show that both rental and sales transfer land to more productive producers but that rental is more important for the poor to access land that becomes available as the non-farm economy develops. The fact that secure land rights significantly increase supply of land to the rental market suggests that government has a key role in facilitating emergence and functioning of efficiency-enhancing land markets.,,"FARM SIZE,PROPERTY-RIGHTS,LABOR-MARKETS,LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS,PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH,CREDIT MARKET,CHINA,AGRICULTURE,INDIA,CONSUMPTION","Deininger, Klaus@World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA::Jin, Songqing@World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA","Deininger, Klaus@The World Bank::Jin, Songqing@The World Bank","Jin, Songqing@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8514-7930","no title+ANDRE C+EUROPEAN J DEV RES+2002::The distributive impact of land markets in Uganda+Baland, Jean-Marie; Gaspart, Frederic; Platteau, Jean-Philippe; et al.+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+JAN 2007::AGRO-EXPORT PRODUCTION AND PEASANT LAND ACCESS - EXAMINING THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN ADOPTION AND ACCUMULATION+BARHAM, B; CARTER, MR; SIGELKO, W+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+FEB 1995::A note on the estimation of Cobb-Douglas production functions when some explanatory variables have zero values+Battese, GE+JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+MAY 1997::no title+BENJAMIN D+AGR INCOME DISTRIBUT+1998::Property rights, labour markets, and efficiency in a transition economy: the case of rural China+Benjamin, D; Brandt, L+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE+NOV 2002::no title+BERRY, R.; CLINE, W.

The analysis of seasonal long memory: The case of Spanish inflation,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00478.x,DEC 2007,21,6,"This paper describes semiparametric techniques recently proposed for the analysis of seasonal or cyclical long memory and applies them to a monthly Spanish inflation series. One of the conclusions is that this series has long memory not only at the origin but also at some but not all seasonal frequencies, suggesting that the fractional difference operator (1-L-12)(d) should be avoided. Moreover, different persistent cycles are observed before and after the first oil crisis. Whereas the cycles seem stationary in the former period, we find evidence of a unit root after 1973, which implies that a shock has a permanent effect. Finally, it is shown how to compute the exact impulse responses and the coefficients in the autoregressive expansion of parametric seasonal long memory models. These two quantities are important to assess the impact of aleatory shocks such as those produced by a change of economic policy and for forecasting purposes, respectively.",,"TIME-SERIES,RANGE DEPENDENCE,INFERENCE,TESTS,MODEL","Arteche, Josu@Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dpt Econ Aplicada Econometria & Estadist 3, Bilbao, Spain","Arteche, Josu@University of Basque Country","Arteche, Josu@B-7649-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6700-3615","Seasonal and cyclical long memory.+Arteche, J; Robinson, PM.+Asymptotics, Nonparametrics and Time Series+1999::Semiparametric robust tests on seasonal or cyclical long memory time series+Arteche, J+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAY 2002::Semiparametric inference in seasonal and cyclical long memory processes+Arteche, J; Robinson, PM+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+JAN 2000::Inference for unstable long-memory processes with applications to fractional unit root autoregressions+Chan, NH; Terrin, N+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 1995::LIMITING DISTRIBUTIONS OF LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATES OF UNSTABLE AUTOREGRESSIVE PROCESSES+CHAN, NH; WEI, CZ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1988::NEW METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF LONG-MEMORY TIME-SERIES - APPLICATION TO SPANISH INFLATION+DELGADO, MA; ROBINSON, PM+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+MAR 1994::The estimation and application of long memory time series models+Geweke, J.; Porter-Hudak, S.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1983::A generalized fractionally differencing approach in long- memory modeling+GIRAITIS, L.; LEIPUS, R.+Liet.

Fewer than 2% of couples migrate for job-related reasons and the majority of these move for reasons associated with the husband's job. Estimates from dynamic random-effects models indicate that husbands and wives in couples that migrated for job-related reasons suffer lower job retention rates than non-migrants. Tied migration reduces the probability of subsequent employment for both husbands and wives and in particular has a large negative impact on job retention rates among wives.,,"FAMILY MIGRATION,MARRIED-WOMEN,MOBILITY,JOB,DETERMINANTS,MARKET,DECISION,RETURNS,INCOME","Taylor, Mark P.@Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England","Taylor, Mark P.@University of Essex",not exist,"State Dependence in Unemployment Incidence: Evidence for British Men Revisited+Arulampalam, W.+Discussion paper, No. 630+2002::Unemployment persistence+Arulampalam, W; Booth, AL; Taylor, MP+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 2000::MIGRATION DECISION - WHAT ROLE DOES JOB MOBILITY PLAY+BARTEL, AP+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1979::I WILL FOLLOW HIM - FAMILY TIES, GENDER-ROLE BELIEFS, AND RELUCTANCE TO RELOCATE FOR A BETTER JOB+BIELBY, WT; BIELBY, DD+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY+MAR 1992::DETERMINANTS OF MOBILITY IN 2-EARNER FAMILIES - DOES THE WIFES INCOME COUNT+BIRD, GA; BIRD, GW+JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY+1985::From the dark end of the street to the bright side of the road?

"Education, occupation and career expectations: Determinants of the gender pay gap for UK graduates",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00483.x,DEC 2007,32,39,"Despite anti-discrimination policies, women are paid 20% less then men in the UK. A large proportion of this wage gap is usually left unexplained. In this paper, I investigate whether the unexplained component is due to mis-specification. Using a sample of recent UK graduates, I examine the role of choice variables (subject of study and occupation) as well as career expectations and aspirations. The evidence indicates that women are more altruistic and less career-oriented than men. Career break expectations, for example, explain 10% of the gender wage gap in the favoured model. By omitting attitudinal variables, most studies are likely to overestimate the unexplained component of the gender wage gap. Women with a more traditional view concerning childrearing are also found to have less intensive search behaviour. Since aspirations may reflect perceived discrimination or social pressure, current legislations are unlikely to reduce the gender wage gap.",,"LABOR-MARKET,WAGE GAP,SEGREGATION,EARNINGS","Chevalier, Arnaud@Univ London, Dept Econ, Royal Holloway, London WC1E 7HU, England@UC Dublin, Geary Inst, Ctr Econ Educ, London Sch Econ, Dublin, Ireland","Chevalier, Arnaud@Royal Holloway University London@University of London@University College Dublin",not exist,"Race and gender in the labor market+Altonji, J.; Blank, R.+HDB LABOR EC C+1999::The motherhood wage penalty: Which mothers pay it and why?+Anderson, DJ; Binder, M; Krause, K+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2002::Women Dont Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide+Babcock, L; Laschever, S+WOMEN DONT ASK: NEGOTIATION AND THE GENDER DIVIDE+2003::Occupational gender composition and wages in Canada, 1987-1988+Baker, M; Fortin, NM+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE+MAY 2001::New evidence on sex segregation and sex differences in wages from matched employee-employer data+Bayard, K; Hellerstein, J; Neumark, D; et al.+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+OCT 2003::Do people mean what they say?

Investment and uncertainty: A theory-based empirical approach,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00464.x,OCT 2007,32,3,"This paper provides empirical evidence on the dynamic effects of uncertainty on firm-level capital accumulation. A novelty in this paper is that the firm-level uncertainty indicator is motivated and derived from a theoretical model, the neoclassical investment model with time to build. This model also serves as the base for the empirical work, where an error-correction approach is employed. I find a negative effect of uncertainty on capital accumulation, both in the short run and the long run. This outcome cannot be explained by the model alone. Instead, the results suggest that the predominant mechanism at work stems from irreversibility constraints.",,"ADJUSTMENT,EQUATIONS","Carlsson, Mikael@Sveriges Riksbank, Res Dept, Stockholm, Sweden","Carlsson, Mikael@Unknow","Carlsson, Mikael@P-6851-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9535-4404","OPTIMAL INVESTMENT UNDER UNCERTAINTY+ABEL, AB+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1983::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::no title+Bertsekas, D.

Has the EU's single market programme fostered competition? Testing for a decrease in mark-up ratios in EU industries,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00447.x,AUG 2007,32,35,"We use a panel approach, covering 10 EU Member States over the period 1981-99, for each of three major industry groups (manufacturing, construction and services) and 18 more detailed industries to test whether the EU's Single Market Programme has led to a reduction in firms' mark-ups over marginal costs. We address explicitly the uncertainty with respect to the timing of the changeover and allow for a possibly continuous regime shift in a smooth transition analysis. Where regime shifts can be found, the velocity of transition is extremely high, making the linear model a justifiable approximation. We also test for discrete structural breaks in the time window from 1986 to 1996, taking up endogeneity concerns in a generalized method of moments framework. Mark-up reductions are found for aggregate manufacturing (although it is also suggested that mark-ups increased in some manufacturing industries in the precompletion period at the end of the 1980s) and also for construction. In contrast, mark-ups have gone up in most service industries since the early 1990s, which confirms the weak state of the Single Market for services and suggests that anti-competitive defence strategies have emerged in EU service industries.",,"PANEL-DATA,PRODUCTIVITY","Badinger, Harald@Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Europinst, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria","Badinger, Harald@Vienna University of Economics & Business",not exist,"European Single Market.

Nonlinearities and fractional integration in the US unemployment rate,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00449.x,AUG 2007,65,42,"This paper proposes a model of the US unemployment rate which accounts for both its asymmetry and its long memory. Our approach introduces fractional integration and nonlinearities simultaneously into the same framework, using a Lagrange multiplier procedure with a standard null-limit distribution. The empirical results suggest that the US unemployment rate can be specified in terms of a fractionally integrated process, which interacts with some nonlinear functions of labour-demand variables such as real oil prices and real interest rates. We also find evidence of a long-memory component. Our results are consistent with a hysteresis model with path dependency rather than a non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) model with an underlying unemployment equilibrium rate, thereby giving support to more activist stabilization policies. However, any suitable model should also include business cycle asymmetries, with implications for both forecasting and policy-making.",,"LONG MEMORY,TIME-SERIES,NONSTATIONARY HYPOTHESES,BUSINESS-CYCLE,INPUT PRICES,MODELS,OUTPUT,RECESSIONS,ADJUSTMENT,INFERENCE","Caporale, Guglielmo Maria@Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge, Middx, England@Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain::Gil-Alana, Luis A.@Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge, Middx, England@Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain","Caporale, Guglielmo Maria@Brunel University@University of Navarra::Gil-Alana, Luis A.@Brunel University@University of Navarra",not exist,"The non-linear dynamics of output and unemployment in the US+Altissimo, F; Violante, GL+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JUL-AUG 2001::New technique for postsample model selection and validation+Ashley, R+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+MAY 1998::Capital shortages and persistent unemployment.+Bean, C; Mayer, C.+Econ Policy+1989::DO RECESSIONS PERMANENTLY CHANGE OUTPUT+BEAUDRY, P; KOOP, G+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+APR 1993::FIRING COSTS AND LABOR DEMAND - HOW BAD IS EUROSCLEROSIS+BENTOLILA, S; BERTOLA, G+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1990::no title+BERAN J+31999 U DORTM+1999::Volatility of stock-market indexes - An analysis based on SEMIFAR models+Beran, J; Ocker, D+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2001::Unemployment persistence: Does the size of the shock matter?+Bianchi, M; Zoega, G+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+MAY-JUN 1998::HYSTERESIS IN UNEMPLOYMENT+BLANCHARD, OJ; SUMMERS, LH+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+FEB-MAR 1987::no title+BLOOMFIELD P+BIOMETRIKA+1973::THE CLEANSING EFFECT OF RECESSIONS+CABALLERO, RJ; HAMMOUR, ML+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1994::no title+CANDELON B+EMPIR ECON+2003::Threshold autoregression with a unit root+Caner, M; Hansen, BE+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2001::Unemployment and input prices: a fractional cointegration approach+Caporale, GM; Gil-Alana, LA+APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS+MAY 2002::Unemployment equilibria and input prices: Theory and evidence from the United States+Carruth, AA; Hooker, MA; Oswald, AJ+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1998::no title+CLEMENTS MP+WHY FORECASE PERFORM+2002::no title+COAKLEY J+STUDIES NONLINEAR DY+2001::no title+CROSS R+NATURAL RATE UNEMPLO+1995::THE MACROECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF DISCONTINUOUS ADJUSTMENT - SELECTIVE MEMORY OF NONDOMINATED EXTREMA+CROSS, R+SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+MAY 1994::COMPARING PREDICTIVE ACCURACY+DIEBOLD, FX; MARIANO, RS+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1995::Properties of nonlinear transformations of fractionally integrated processes+Dittmann, I; Granger, CWJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 2002::no title+DUEKER MJ+NON MONOTINIC LM DYN+1998::Testing the adequacy of smooth transition autoregressive models+Eitrheim, O; Terasvirta, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 1996::no title+FRANSES PH+9852A ER U ROTT+1998::ROLE OF MONETARY POLICY+FRIEDMAN, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1968::Seasonal misspecification in the context of fractionally integrated univariate time series+Gil-Alana, L.A.+Computational Economics+Aug. 2003::Seasonal long memory in the aggregate output+Gil-Alana, LA+ECONOMICS LETTERS+FEB 2002::Mean reversion in the real exchange rates+Gil-Alana, LA+ECONOMICS LETTERS+DEC 2000::Testing of seasonal fractional integration in UK and Japanese consumption and income+Gil-Alana, LA; Robinson, PM+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+MAR-APR 2001::A fractionally integrated exponential model for UK unemployment+Gil-Alana, LA+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+AUG 2001::Testing of unit root and other nonstationary hypotheses in macroeconomic time series+GilAlana, LA; Robinson, PM+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 1997::Varieties of long memory models+Granger, CWJ; Ding, ZX+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1996::LONG MEMORY SERIES WITH ATTRACTORS+GRANGER, CWJ; HALLMAN, J+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1991::Adjustment costs in factor demand+Hamermesh, DS; Pfann, GA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+SEP 1996::Inference in TAR models+Hansen, BE+STUDIES IN NONLINEAR DYNAMICS AND ECONOMETRICS+APR 1997::Dissecting the cycle: a methodological investigation+Harding, D; Pagan, A+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAR 2002::Testing the equality of prediction mean squared errors+Harvey, D; Leybourne, S; Newbold, P+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JUN 1997::(Mis) specification of long memory in seasonal time+Hassler, U.+J.

The omission of a relevant orthogonal regressor leads to increased unobserved heterogeneity, and this depresses the beta coefficients of the remaining regressors towards zero. For the probit model, Wooldridge (Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2002) has shown that this bias does not carry over to the effect of these regressors on the outcome. We find by simulations that this also holds for the logit model, even when omitting a variable leads to severe mis-specification of the disturbance. More simulations show that logit analysis is quite insensitive to pure mis-specification of the disturbance as such.",,MODELS,"Cramer, J.

The paper examines the relationship between these for the manufacturing sector in a sample of 33 countries. It applies a recently developed method, based on linear feedback models, and uses cross-country time-series data. Despite the relatively small number of observations, the results indicate that domestic competition, external market share, and research and development have a positive effect on innovation activities.

Twin data vs. Longitudinal data to control for unobserved variables in earnings functions - Which are the differences?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00197.x,JUN 2007,41,9,"This paper compares two different approaches empirically to control for unobserved characteristics when estimating the effect of marriage on male and female earnings: the longitudinal and the twins approach. The estimates were obtained by exploiting the longitudinal dimension of a large sample of Swedish twins, so that longitudinal and twin-based estimates could be obtained in the same sample. The two approaches lead to different conclusions both regarding the role of unobserved characteristics in the cross-sectional earnings-marriage relationship and the effect of marriage on earnings.

Measuring conditional persistence in nonlinear time series,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00437.x,JUN 2007,23,2,"The persistence properties of economic time series have been a primary object of investigation in a variety of guises since the early days of econometrics. Recently, work on nonlinear modelling for time series has introduced the idea that persistence of a shock at a point in time may vary depending on the state of the process at that point in time. This article suggests investigating the persistence of processes conditioning on their history as a tool that may aid parametric nonlinear modelling. In particular, we suggest that examining the nonparametrically estimated derivatives of the conditional expectation of a variable with respect to its lag(s) may be a useful indicator of the variation in persistence with respect to its past history. We discuss in detail the implementation of the measure and present a Monte Carlo investigation.

Like Hausman et al. [Journal of Econometrics (1988) Vol. 87, pp. 239-269], our model captures the extent and direction of uncertainty by respondents. Using a Bayesian methodology, we apply our model to a choice modelling (CM) data set examining UK consumer preferences for non-pesticide food. We compare the results of our model with the Hausman model. WTP estimates are produced for different groups of consumers and we find that modified estimates of WTP, that take account of mis-reporting, are substantially revised downwards. We find a significant proportion of respondents mis-reporting in favour of the non-pesticide option.

Price cuts are almost as frequent as increases, suggesting no specific downward nominal rigidity. Price changes typically have large absolute sizes. Time variation in the frequency of price changes and in their size both contribute to inflation fluctuations.

Business cycles and the role of confidence: Evidence for Europe,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00472.x,APR 2007,42,36,"This paper examines whether indicators of consumer and business confidence can predict movements in GDP over the business cycle for four European economies. The empirical methodology used to investigate the properties of the data comprises cross-correlation statistics, implementing an approach developed by den Haan [Journal of Monetary Economics (2000), Vol. 46, pp. 3-30]. The predictive power of confidence indicators is also examined, investigating whether they can predict discrete events, namely economic downturns, and whether they can quantitatively forecast point estimates of economic activity. The results indicate that both consumer and business confidence indicators are procyclical and generally play a significant role in predicting downturns.",,"CONSUMER CONFIDENCE,FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS,RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS,LEADING INDICATORS,UNITED-KINGDOM,FACTS,VARIABLES,PRICES,OUTPUT,UK","Taylor, Karl@Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England@Univ Cardiff Wales, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, Wales::McNabb, Robert@Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England@Univ Cardiff Wales, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, Wales","Taylor, Karl@University of Sheffield@Cardiff University::McNabb, Robert@University of Sheffield@Cardiff University","Taylor, Karl@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6525-0815","no title+ABEL A+MACROECONOMICS EUROP+1998::CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS - ARE AGENTS BELIEFS CONSISTENT WITH THE THEORY+ACEMOGLU, D; SCOTT, A+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JAN 1994::A comparison of the statistical properties of financial variables in the USA, UK and Germany over the business cycle+Andreou, E; Osborn, DR; Sensier, M+MANCHESTER SCHOOL+2000::STICKY PRICES AS COORDINATION FAILURE+BALL, L; ROMER, D+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1991::Improving macro-economic forecasts - The role of consumer confidence+Batchelor, R; Dua, P+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+MAR 1998::no title+BERGMAN M+SERIES FEDERAL RESER+1998::Predicting US business-cycle regimes+Birchenhall, CR; Jessen, H; Osborn, DR; et al.+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1999::BUSINESS CYCLES IN THE UNITED-KINGDOM - FACTS AND FICTIONS+BLACKBURN, K; RAVN, MO+ECONOMICA+NOV 1992::Forecasting industrial production in the euro area+Bodo, G.; Golinelli, R.; Parigi, G.+Empirical Economics+2000::Does consumer confidence forecast household expenditure?

The calibrated New Keynesian model performs almost as well as the estimated vector autoregressive model in replicating Euro area cyclical correlations between key variables such as output and inflation, although it fares less well in predicting the procyclical dynamics of nominal interest rates. The presence of a time-to-build requirement in the model helps to improve its fit to Euro area data, whereas the role of transactions-facilitating money is much less important.

Unintended consequences: Does aid promote arms races?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00439.x,FEB 2007,47,62,"Using global data for the period 1960-99, we model military expenditure. Neighbours' military spending and development aid are important determinants of military expenditure. An implication of the model is that there are regional arms races which are fuelled by aid. Potentially, aid is encouraging a 'regional public bad'. There may, however, be an offsetting public good effect if military spending deters rebellions. In a simultaneous equation model, we find no deterrence effect of spending on the risk of civil war. Hence, there appears to be no regional public good effect offsetting the public bad arising from a neighbourhood arms race.",,"CIVIL-WAR,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,MILITARY EXPENDITURES,DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES,FOREIGN-AID,CONFLICT,MODELS,PEACE,DEMOCRACY,AFRICA","Collier, Paul@Ctr Study African Econ, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England::Hoeffler, Anke@Ctr Study African Econ, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England","Collier, Paul@University of Oxford::Hoeffler, Anke@University of Oxford",not exist,"no title+no author+Advances in Spatial Econometrics: Methodology, Tools and Applications+2004::no title+Barrett, David B.+World Christian Encyclopedia+1982::no title+Barro, Robert J.+Determinants of Economic Growth+1997::World Military Expenditures+Brzoska, M.+HDB DEFENSE EC+1995::Aid, policy and peace: Reducing the risks of civil conflict+Collier, P; Hoeffler, A+DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS+DEC 2002::Conflicts+Collier, P.+Global Crises, Global Solutions+2004::On the incidence of civil war in Africa+Collier, P; Hoeffler, A+JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION+FEB 2002::Greed and grievance in civil war+Collier, P; Hoeffler, A+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+OCT 2004::no title+Collier, Paul.+Breaking the Conflict Trap: Civil War and Development Policy+2003::Military expenditure in post-conflict societies+Collier, Paul; Hoeffler, Anke.+Economics of Governance+2006::no title+DEGER S+P WORLD BANK ANN C D+1991::The Demand for Military Spending in Developing Countries+Dunne, Paul; Perlo-Freeman, S.+International Review of Applied Economics+2003::Ethnicity, insurgency, and civil war+Fearon, JD; Laitin, DD+AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW+FEB 2003::A panel data analysis of the fungibility of foreign aid+Feyzioglu, T; Swaroop, V; Zhu, M+WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW+JAN 1998::no title+GARTZKE E+AFFINITY NATIONS IND+2002::Armed conflict 1946-2001: A new dataset+Gleditsch, NP; Wallensteen, P; Eriksson, M; et al.+JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH+SEP 2002::DEFENSE SPENDING AND ECONOMIC-GROWTH IN SUBSAHARAN AFRICA - AN ECONOMETRIC INVESTIGATION+GYIMAHBREMPONG, K+JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH+FEB 1989::The Economics of Defence Spending+no author+An International Survey+1990::no title+Hartley, K.; Sandler, T.+The Economics of Defence+2001::Toward a democratic civil peace?

It shows that a testable implication of this hypothesis is that the wage elasticity of child labour supply is negative. Using a large household survey for rural Pakistan, labour supply models for boys and girls in wage work are estimated. Conditioning on non-labour income and a range of demographic variables, the article finds a negative wage elasticity for boys and an elasticity that is insignificantly different from zero for girls. Thus, while boys appear to work on account of poverty compulsions, the evidence for girls is ambiguous.",,"SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION,EMPIRICAL-MODEL,LABOR,PAKISTAN,INDIA","Bhalotra, Sonia@Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol, Avon, England","Bhalotra, Sonia@University of Bristol",not exist,"no title+ATTANASIO O+INTERACTIONS FAMILY+1997::Tests of income pooling in household decisions+Attanasio, O; Lechene, V+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS+OCT 2002::Is child labor inefficient?+Baland, JM; Robinson, JA+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+AUG 2000::ASSETS, SUBSISTENCE, AND SUPPLY CURVE OF LABOR+BARZEL, Y; MCDONALD, RJ+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1973::The economics of child labor+Basu, K; Van, PH+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1998::Child labor: Cause, consequence, and cure, with remarks on international labor standards+Basu, K+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+SEP 1999::The global child labor problem: What do we know and what can we do?+Basu, K; Tzannatos, Z+WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW+2003::no title+Becker, G.

A stochastic frontier with non-monotonic marginal effects [Wang, Journal of Productivity Analysis (2002, Vol. 18, pp. 241-253] reveals a wide disparity in technical efficiency levels among 190 Mexican semi-formal financial intermediaries. The results show that technology, average loan size, rural outreach and institutional age are all positively associated with technical efficiency. The marginal effects vary widely and, in some cases, the effects are non-monotonic over percentile groups. The results indicate that strengthening younger, technologically undeveloped financial institutions will have the strongest marginal benefit in revitalizing the rural financial sector.",,"BANKING,HETEROSCEDASTICITY,LIBERALIZATION,CONSTRAINTS,INVESTMENT","Paxton, Julia@Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, Athens, OH 45701 USA","Paxton, Julia@Ohio University",not exist,"Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models+Aigner, D.; Lovell, C.; Schmidt, P.+Journal of Econometrics+1977::A Model for Technical Inefficiency Effects in a Stochastic Frontier Production Function for Panel Data+Aigner, D.J.+Empirical Economics+1995::TECHNICAL, SCALE, AND ALLOCATIVE EFFICIENCIES IN UNITED-STATES BANKING - AN EMPIRICAL-INVESTIGATION+ALY, HY; GRABOWSKI, R; PASURKA, C; et al.+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 1990::Estimating production uncertainty in stochastic frontier production function models+Bera, AK; Sharma, SC+JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY ANALYSIS+NOV 1999::Efficiency of financial institutions: International survey and directions for future research+Berger, AN; Humphrey, DB+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+APR 16 1997::no title+CARSTENS CM+FINANZAS POPULARES M+1996::BIASES IN FRONTIER ESTIMATION DUE TO HETEROSCEDASTICITY+CAUDILL, SB; FORD, JM+ECONOMICS LETTERS+1993::MEASURING EFFICIENCY OF DECISION-MAKING UNITS+CHARNES, A; COOPER, WW; RHODES, E+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+1978::Development banking+de Aghion, BA+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+FEB 1999::Financial liberalization, credit constraints, and collateral: investment in the Mexican manufacturing sector+Gelos, RG; Werner, AM+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+FEB 2002::Start-up capital, microenterprises and technical efficiency in Mexico+Hernandez-Trillo, F; Pagan, JA; Paxton, J+REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+AUG 2005::Estimation of a non-neutral stochastic frontier production function+Huang, Cliff J.; Liu, Jin-Tan.+Journal of Productivity Analysis+1994::no title+Kumbhakar, S.

The identification strategy exploits this decentralized structure, relying on instrumental variables constructed from regional mistargeting at the initial phase of allocation. The programme has increased enrolment, especially for primary school-aged children from poor rural households. Moreover, the scholarships seem to have assisted households in smoothing consumption during the crisis, relieving pressure on households' investments in education and utilization of child labour.",,"INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES,IDENTIFICATION,MARKETS,WELFARE,GENDER","Sparrow, Robert@Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands@Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands@Inst Social Studies, NL-2509 LS The Hague, Netherlands","Sparrow, Robert@Unknow@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam@Unknow",not exist,"no title+ANANTA A+ASEAN EC B+1999::Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::Progressing through PROGRESA: An impact assessment of a school subsidy experiment in rural Mexico+Behrman, JR; Sengupta, P; Todd, P+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+OCT 2005::ARE THERE DIFFERENTIAL RETURNS TO SCHOOLING BY GENDER - THE CASE OF INDONESIAN LABOR-MARKETS+BEHRMAN, JR; DEOLALIKAR, AB+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1995::no title+*BPS+UNPUB TINGK KEM KAB+2000::no title+CAMERON LA+B INDONES ECON STUD+1999::Education expenditure responses to crop loss in Indonesia: A gender bias+Cameron, LA; Worswick, C+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+JAN 2001::Did Social Safety Net Scholarships Reduce Drop-out Rates During the Indonesian Economic Crisis?+Cameron, Lisa.+World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 2800+2002::Child Labour and Schooling in Ghana+Canagarajah, S.; Coulombe, H.+Policy Research Working Paper 1844+1997::no title+FITZSIMONS E+W0207 I FISC STUD+2003::Economic shocks, wealth, and welfare+Frankenberg, E; Smith, JP; Thomas, D+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SPR 2003::The distributional impacts of Indonesia's financial crisis on household welfare: A ""rapid response"" methodology+Friedman, J; Levinsohn, J+WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW+2002::Instrumental variables - A study of implicit behavioral assumptions used in making program evaluations+Heckman, J+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SUM 1997::Using matching, instrumental variables, and control functions to estimate economic choice models+Heckman, J; Navarro-Lozano, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2004::IDENTIFICATION AND ESTIMATION OF LOCAL AVERAGE TREATMENT EFFECTS+IMBENS, GW; ANGRIST, JD+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1994::Risk, financial markets, and human capital in a developing country+Jacoby, HG; Skoufias, E+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1997::Schooling in Indonesia: Crisis-related and longer-term issues+Jones, GW; Hagul, P+BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES+AUG 2001::Poverty, education and health in Indonesia: who benefits from public spending?+Lanjouw, P.; Pradhan, M.; Saadah, F.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Sayed, H.; Sparrow, R</span>.+Education and Health Expenditures, and Development: The Cases of Indonesia and Peru+2002::A concise history of Canadian architecture+Maitland, L+URBAN HISTORY REVIEW-REVUE D HISTOIRE URBAINE+MAR 2002::no title+MALUCCIO JA+174 IFPRI FOOD CONS+2004::no title+*MIN ED CULT MIN R+PROGR IMPL PLAN SCHO+1998::no title+PARKER SW+SCH SUBSIDIES ACHIEV+2005::no title+PRIYAMBADA A+HAPPENED CHILD LABOR+2002::Does child labor displace schooling?

Does Education Matter for Economic Growth?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12025,JUN 2014,56,22,"Empirical growth regressions typically include mean years of schooling as a proxy for human capital. However, empirical research often finds that the sign and significance of schooling depends on the sample of observations or the specification of the model. We use a non-parametric local-linear regression estimator and a non-parametric variable relevance test to conduct a rigorous and systematic search for significance of mean years of schooling by examining five of the most comprehensive schooling databases. Contrary to a few recent articles that have identified significant nonlinearities between education and growth, our results suggest that mean years of schooling is not a statistically relevant variable in growth regressions. However, we do find evidence (within a cross-sectional framework), that educational achievement, measured by mean test scores, may provide a more reliable measure of human capital than mean years of schooling.",,"SOLOW MODEL,REGRESSIONS,COUNTRIES,QUALITY,NONLINEARITIES,EMPIRICS,DETERMINANTS,ROBUSTNESS,ATTAINMENT,OUTPUT","Delgado, Michael S.@Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA::Henderson, Daniel J.@Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA::Parmeter, Christopher F.@Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Delgado, Michael S.@Purdue University@Purdue University System::Henderson, Daniel J.@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@University of Alabama System::Parmeter, Christopher F.@University of Miami","Henderson, Daniel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4940-9689","A new dataset of educational attainment in the world, 1950-2010+Barro, R.J;

"Identifying Changes in Mean, Seasonality, Persistence and Volatility for G7 and Euro Area Inflation*",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12021,JUN 2014,40,6,"We propose an iterative decomposition that tests and accounts for multiple structural breaks in the mean, seasonality, dynamics and conditional volatility, while also accounting for outliers. Considering each component separately within each iteration leads to greater flexibility compared with joint procedures. Monte Carlo analysis shows the procedure performs well. Applied to monthly CPI inflation in G7 countries and the Euro area, we uncover mean and seasonality breaks for all countries and, allowing for these, changes in persistence are generally also indicated. Further, volatility reductions are widespread in the early to mid 1980s, with some countries exhibiting increases from 1999 onwards.","E31,E52,C22","STRUCTURAL-CHANGE,PARAMETER INSTABILITY,ADDITIVE OUTLIERS,MONETARY-POLICY,LINEAR-MODELS,TIME-SERIES,OUTPUT,HETEROSKEDASTICITY,DYNAMICS,TESTS","Bataa, Erdenebat@Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Econ Studies, Ulaanbaatar, Mongol Peo Rep::Osborn, Denise R.@Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England::Sensier, Marianne@Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England::van Dijk, Dick@Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Bataa, Erdenebat@National University of Mongolia::Osborn, Denise R.@University of Manchester::Sensier, Marianne@University of Manchester::van Dijk, Dick@Erasmus University Rotterdam",not exist,"Sectoral and aggregate inflation dynamics in the euro area+Altissimo, F; Matha, T; Bilke, L; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION+APR-MAY 2006::TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::'Discussion of Has the inflation process changed?+Arellano, M.+Economic Policy+2006::Multiple structural change models: a simulation study+Bai, J.; Perron, P.+Econometric theory and practice: Frontiers of analysis and applied research+2006::Computation and analysis of multiple structural change models+Bai, J; Perron, P+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 2003::Critical values for multiple structural change tests+Bai, J.; Perron, P.+The Econometrics Journal+2003::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::Structural breaks in the international dynamics of inflation+Bataa, E.; Osborn, D.

Taxes and Benefits: Two Options to Cheat on the State,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12024,JUN 2014,55,4,"In this article we study the social norms to abstain from cheating on the state via benefit fraud and tax evasion. We interpret these norms (called benefit morale and tax morale) as moral goods, and derive testable hypotheses on whether their demand is determined by prices.

Firm Recruitment Behaviour: Sequential or Non-sequential Search?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12027,JUN 2014,60,2,"In the extensive job search literature, studies assume either sequential or non-sequential search. This article introduces a novel method to test the hypothesis that firms search sequentially based on the relationship between the number of rejected job applicants and the number of filled vacancies. We distinguish between ten different search methods. For most search methods, including methods that rely on social networks and temporary help agencies, we find that sequential search cannot be rejected. However, when firms use advertising or public/private employment agencies, sequential search is rejected. Hence, we find that both forms of search are relevant for our understanding of the labour market. Further, the form of search is closely related to the search method used.",,"LABOR-MARKET,MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS,EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS,VACANCY DURATION,EMPLOYER SEARCH,JOB SEARCH,EQUILIBRIUM,UNEMPLOYMENT,MODELS,EXTERNALITIES","van Ommeren, Jos@Free Univ Amsterdam, FEWEB, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Russo, Giovanni@Cedefop, Thessaloniki 55102, Greece","van Ommeren, Jos@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam::Russo, Giovanni@Unknow",not exist,"SEQUENTIAL OR NONSEQUENTIAL EMPLOYERS SEARCH+ABBRING, JH; VANOURS, JC+ECONOMICS LETTERS+1994::High wage workers and high wage firms+Abowd, JM; Kramarz, F; Margolis, DN+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1999::JOBS AS DAM SITES+AKERLOF, GA+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+1981::Equilibrium directed search with multiple applications+Albrecht, James; Gautier, Pieter A.; Vroman, Susan+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+OCT 2006::Matching with multiple applications+Albrecht, JW; Gautier, PA; Vroman, SB+ECONOMICS LETTERS+JAN 2003::Successful employer search?

Results provide broad support for a positive long-run impact of ODA flows on the macroeconomy. In contrast, we find little evidence supporting the thesis that aid has been harmful. From a methodological point of view we highlight the importance of transparency in reporting results, especially when the hypothesis being tested differs from theoretical expectations, and we identify reasons for econometrically inadequate results in the literature.","F35,C32,O11","GROWTH,MODEL,INVESTMENT,POLICIES","Juselius, Katarina@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark::Moller, Niels Framroze@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark::Tarp, Finn@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark@UNU WIDER, FI-00160 Helsinki, Finland","Juselius, Katarina@University of Copenhagen::Moller, Niels Framroze@University of Copenhagen::Tarp, Finn@University of Copenhagen","Tarp, Finn@T-9651-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6247-4370::Moller, Niels Framroze@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8355-2940","no title+[Anonymous].+UNU- WIDER Working Paper 22.+2011::Aid, Growth, and Development: Have we Come Full Circle?+Arndt, Channing; Jones, Sam; Tarp, Finn.+Journal of Globalization and Development+2010::A 3-GAP MODEL OF FOREIGN TRANSFERS AND THE GDP GROWTH-RATE IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES+BACHA, EL+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+APR 1990::Politics and the effectiveness of foreign aid+Boone, P+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+FEB 1996::Aid, policies, and growth+Burnside, C; Dollar, D+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 2000::Measuring Aid Flows: A New Approach+Chang, C.

Do Low-Wage Workers React Less to Longer Unemployment Benefits? Quasi-Experimental Evidence,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12019,APR 2014,24,1,The fact that unemployed workers have different abilities to smooth consumption entails heterogeneous responses to extended unemployment benefits. Our empirical exercise explores a quasi-experimental setting generated by an increase in the benefits entitlement period. The results suggest a hump-shape response of unemployment duration over the one-year pre-unemployment wage distribution; individuals at the bottom and top of the wage distribution reacted less than those in the interquartile range. This behaviour of job searchers is consistent with labour supply models with unemployment insurance and savings. It questions the optimality of very long entitlement periods to target the unemployment experiences of low-wage workers.,"J22,J64,J65","RESERVATION WAGES,LABOR-MARKET,JOB SEARCH,DURATION,TRANSITIONS,WEALTH,EMPLOYMENT,INSURANCE,GERMANY,MODELS","Centeno, Mario@Banco Portugal, P-1150 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Tecn Lisboa, ISEG, UECE, Lisbon, Portugal@ISEGI, Lisbon, Portugal@IZA, Bonn, Germany::Novo, Alvaro A.@Banco Portugal, P-1150 Lisbon, Portugal@IZA, Bonn, Germany@Univ Lusofona, Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Tecn Lisboa, UECE, Lisbon, Portugal","Centeno, Mario@Universidade de Lisboa@Banco de Portugal@IZA Institute Labor Economics::Novo, Alvaro A.@Universidade de Lisboa@Banco de Portugal@IZA Institute Labor Economics","Centeno, Mario@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8374-0482::Novo, Alvaro@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9406-9839","Unemployment Benefits and Reservation Wages: Key Elasticities from a Stripped-Down Job Search Approach+Addison, John T.; Centeno, Mario; Portugal, Pedro+ECONOMICA+JAN 2010::How do different entitlements to unemployment benefits affect the transitions from unemployment into employment?+Addison, John T.; Portugal, Pedro+ECONOMICS LETTERS+DEC 2008::Do Reservation Wages Really Decline?

Doing so we find that, while there is a instantaneous reaction in the exchange rate following a monetary policy shock in all countries, monetary policy responds significantly on impact to an exchange rate shock in only four of the six countries.","E52,F41,F31,C32","AGNOSTIC IDENTIFICATION,COST CHANNEL,OPEN-ECONOMY,TRANSMISSION,SHOCKS","Bjornland, Hilde C.@Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, N-0442 Oslo, Norway::Halvorsen, Jorn I.@Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, N-0442 Oslo, Norway","Bjornland, Hilde C.@BI Norwegian Business School::Halvorsen, Jorn I.@BI Norwegian Business School",not exist,"Monetary policy and exchange rate overshooting: Dornbusch was right after all+Bjornland, Hilde C.+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+SEP 2009::Monetary policy actions, intervention, and exchange rates: A reexamination of the empirical relationships using federal funds rate target data+Bonser-Neal, C; Roley, VV; Sellon, GH+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+APR 1998::Business cycle measurement with some theory+Canova, Fabio; Paustian, Matthias+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 2011::Monetary policy shocks, Choleski identification, and DNK models+Carlstrom, Charles T.; Fuerst, Timothy S.; Paustian, Matthias+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+OCT 2009::Inflation dynamics and the cost channel of monetary transmission+Chowdhury, Ibrahim; Hoffmann, Mathias; Schabert, Andreas+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2006::Monetary policy shocks: What have we learned and to what end?+Christiano, LJ; Eichenbaum, M; Evans, CL+HANDBOOK OF MACROECONOMICS, VOLS 1A-1C+1999::Optimal monetary policy in open versus closed economies: An integrated approach+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2001::Identifying monetary policy in a small open economy under flexible exchange rates+Cushman, DO; Zha, T+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+AUG 1997::RATS user's guide+Doan, T.+Estima+2007::Do Central Banks Respond to Exchange Rate Movements?

We find that the relative utility of 'soft' indicators surged during the recession. But as this instability was hard to detect in real-time it helps, when producing density nowcasts unknowing any within-quarter 'hard' data, to weight the different indicators equally. On receipt of 'hard' data for the second month in the quarter better calibrated densities are obtained by giving a higher weight in the combination to 'hard' indicators.","C32,C82,C53","BANK-OF-ENGLAND,COMBINING DENSITY,FORECAST DENSITIES,RISK-MANAGEMENT,OUTPUT GROWTH,FAN CHARTS,INFLATION,INTERVAL","Mazzi, Gian Luigi@Eurostat, L-2920 Luxembourg, Luxembourg::Mitchell, James@Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Montana, Gaetana@European Parliament, B-104 Brussels, Belgium","Mazzi, Gian Luigi@Unknow::Mitchell, James@University of Warwick::Montana, Gaetana@Unknow",not exist,"Nowcasting GDP in real-time: a density combination approach+Aastveit, K.

The evolution of these quantities has interesting implications for macroeconomic dynamics. Parameters estimated for US equity portfolios display significant low-frequency fluctuations, along patterns that change across size and book-to-market stocks. Time-varying betas display superior predictive accuracy for returns against constant and rolling-window OLS estimates. As to the relationship of betas with business-cycle variables, value stocks' betas move pro-cyclically, unlike those of growth stocks. Investment growth, rather than consumption, predicts the betas of value and small-firm portfolios.","G11,C48,E44","EXPECTED STOCK RETURNS,STRUCTURAL-CHANGE MODELS,CROSS-SECTION,CONDITIONAL CAPM,VALUE PREMIUM,HETEROSKEDASTICITY,CONSUMPTION,GROWTH,EQUITY,MARKET","Trecroci, Carmine@Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, I-25122 Brescia, Italy","Trecroci, Carmine@University of Brescia","TRECROCI, Carmine@M-1326-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2281-1181","Learning about beta: Time-varying factor loadings, expected returns, and the conditional CAPM+Adrian, Tobias; Franzoni, Francesco+JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE+SEP 2009::The impact of risk and uncertainty on expected returns+Anderson, Evan W.; Ghysels, Eric; Juergens, Jennifer L.+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+NOV 2009::AN IMPROVED HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATOR+ANDREWS, DWK; MONAHAN, JC+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1992::HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::CAPM over the long run: 1926-2001+Ang, A.; Chen, J.+Journal of Empirical Finance+2007::Testing conditional factor models+Ang, Andrew; Kristensen, Dennis+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+OCT 2012::Stock return predictability: Is it there?+Ang, Andrew; Bekaert, Geert+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+MAY 2007::Computation and analysis of multiple structural change models+Bai, J; Perron, P+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 2003::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::The intertemporal relation between expected returns and risk+Bali, Turan G.+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JAN 2008::Consumption, dividends, and the cross section of equity returns+Bansal, R; Dittmar, RF; Lundblad, CT+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+AUG 2005::Risk, uncertainty, and asset prices+Bekaert, Geert; Engstrom, Eric; Xing, Yuhang+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JAN 2009::Bad beta, good beta+Campbell, JY; Vuolteenaho, T+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2004::Time-Varying Risk Premiums and the Output Gap+Cooper, Ilan; Priestley, Richard+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+JUL 2009::Application of kalman Filtering in Econometrics+Engle, R.

Indirect Estimation of Semiparametric Binary Choice Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12000,APR 2014,19,0,"Abstract

One of the most cited studies within the field of binary choice models is that of Klein and Spady (1993), in which the authors propose a semiparametric estimator for use when the distribution of the error term is unknown. However, although theoretically appealing, the estimator has been found to be difficult to implement, and therefore not very attractive from an applied point of view. The current study offers an indirect inference-based solution to this problem. The new estimator is not only simple with good small-sample properties, but also consistent and asymptotically normal.",C25,"INDIRECT INFERENCE,RESPONSE MODELS","Westerlund, Joakim@Deakin Univ, Financial Econometr Grp, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia::Hjertstrand, Per@Res Inst Ind Econ, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden","Westerlund, Joakim@Deakin University::Hjertstrand, Per@Unknow",not exist,"Semiparametric approaches to welfare evaluations in binary response models+Belluzzo, W+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2004::Efficient estimation of binary choice models under symmetry+Chen, SN+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 2000::SNP and SML estimation of univariate and bivariate binary-choice models+De Luca, Giuseppe+STATA JOURNAL+2008::A nonparametric simulated maximum likelihood estimation method+Fermanian, JD; Salanie, B+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 2004::no title+FERNANDEZ AI+ECONOMET REV+1997::Non-parametric regression for binary dependent variables+Froelich, Markus+ECONOMETRICS JOURNAL+2006::Parametric and semi-parametric estimation of the binary response model of labour market participation+Gerfin, M+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+MAY-JUN 1996::INDIRECT INFERENCE+GOURIEROUX, C; MONFORT, A; RENAULT, E+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+DEC 1993::no title+Gourieroux, C; Monfort, A.+Simulation-Based Econometric Methods+1996::Indirect inference for dynamic panel models+Gourieroux, Christian; Phillips, Peter C.

This study suggests that these externalities may arise because plants by having access to a more qualified workforce at a regional level, can benefit more from R&D spillovers than those located in areas with less qualified workforce.

Our results show that own-industry multinational firm contact was associated with more frequent, higher-valued, and longer-lasting new trade transactions. These effects appear to arise from beneficial multinational spillovers, rather than selection effects due to increased multinational competition, as increases in own-industry or other multinational presence were also associated with an increase in the number of trade transactions introduced by private Chinese firms.",,"FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT,DOMESTIC FIRMS,INTERNATIONAL-TRADE,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,PRODUCT,SPILLOVERS,NETWORKS,LINKAGES,VARIETY,BENEFIT","Swenson, Deborah L.@Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA@NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA::Chen, Huiya@Unknow","Swenson, Deborah L.@National Bureau of Economic Research@University of California Davis@University of California System::Chen, Huiya@Unknow",not exist,"Spillovers, foreign investment, and export behavior+Aitken, B; Hanson, GH; Harrison, AE+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+AUG 1997::Do domestic firms benefit from direct foreign investment?

Unit Root Testing under a Local Break in Trend using Partial Information on the Break Date,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12013,FEB 2014,21,1,"We consider unit root testing allowing for a break in trend when partial information is available regarding the location of the break date. This takes the form of knowledge of a relatively narrow window of data within which the break takes place, should it occur at all. For such circumstances, we suggest employing a union of rejections strategy, which combines a unit root test that allows for a trend break somewhere within the window with a unit root test that makes no allowance for a trend break. Asymptotic and finite sample evidence shows that our suggested strategy works well, provided that, when a break does occur, the partial information is correct. An empirical application to UK interest rate data containing the 1973 oil shock' is also considered.",,"ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES,INITIAL CONDITION,STRUCTURAL-CHANGE,UNCERTAINTY,POWER,NULL","Harvey, David I.@Univ Nottingham, Granger Ctr Time Series Econometr, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Leybourne, Stephen J.@Unknow::Taylor, A.

Estimating and Forecasting with a Dynamic Spatial Panel Data Model,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12011,FEB 2014,45,29,"This study focuses on the estimation and predictive performance of several estimators for the dynamic and autoregressive spatial lag panel data model with spatially correlated disturbances. In the spirit of Arellano and Bond (1991) and Mutl (2006), a dynamic spatial generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator is proposed based on Kapoor, Kelejian and Prucha (2007) for the spatial autoregressive (SAR) error model. The main idea is to mix non-spatial and spatial instruments to obtain consistent estimates of the parameters. Then, a linear predictor of this spatial dynamic model is derived. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the performance of the GMM spatial estimator to that of spatial and non-spatial estimators and illustrate our approach with an application to new economic geography.",,"ERROR-COMPONENTS,PREDICTION,REGRESSION,MARKET","Baltagi, Badi H.@Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA@Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA::Fingleton, Bernard@Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England::Pirotte, Alain@Univ Paris 04, Univ Paris 02, CNRS, ERMES, Paris, France@French Inst Sci & Technol Transport Dev & Network, IFSTTAR DEST, Noisy Le Grand, France","Baltagi, Badi H.@Syracuse University::Fingleton, Bernard@University of Cambridge::Pirotte, Alain@Sorbonne Universite@Universite Paris 2 Pantheon-Assas@IFSTTAR@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite-USPC (ComUE)",not exist,"FORMULATION AND ESTIMATION OF DYNAMIC-MODELS USING PANEL DATA+ANDERSON, TW; HSIAO, C+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1982::ESTIMATION OF DYNAMIC-MODELS WITH ERROR-COMPONENTS+ANDERSON, TW; HSIAO, C+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1981::no title+Anselin,, L.+Spatial econometrics: methods and models+1988::Spatial panel econometrics+Anselin, L.; Le Gallo, J.; Jayet, H.+The Econometrics of Panel Data+2008::Panel data models: some recent developments+Arellano, M.; Honore, B.+Handbook of Econometrics+2001::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::no title+Baltagi, B.+Econometric analysis of panel data+2008::Prediction in the panel data model with spatial correlation: the case of liquor+Baltagi, B.

On the Applicability of the Sieve Bootstrap in Time Series Panels,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12005,FEB 2014,26,2,"In this article, we investigate the validity of the univariate autoregressive sieve bootstrap applied to time series panels characterized by general forms of cross-sectional dependence, including but not restricted to cointegration. Using the final equations approach we show that while it is possible to write such a panel as a collection of infinite order autoregressive equations, the innovations of these equations are not vector white noise. This causes the univariate autoregressive sieve bootstrap to be invalid in such panels. We illustrate this result with a small numerical example using a simple DGP for which the sieve bootstrap is invalid, and show that the extent of the invalidity depends on the value of specific parameters. We also show that Monte Carlo simulations in small samples can be misleading about the validity of the univariate autoregressive sieve bootstrap. The results in this article serve as a warning about the practical use of the autoregressive sieve bootstrap in panels where cross-sectional dependence of general form may be present.",,"UNIT-ROOT TESTS,PPP","Smeekes, Stephan@Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands::Urbain, Jean-Pierre@Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands","Smeekes, Stephan@Maastricht University::Urbain, Jean-Pierre@Maastricht University",not exist,"no title+Brockwell, P.

Our empirical approach accommodates these difficulties and seeks to model the nature of the cross-section dependence in a sample of 128 countries (1961-2002). Our results suggest that agro-climatic environment drives similarity in TFP evolution across countries with heterogeneous production technology.

They argue that the implementation of market-oriented reform is crucially driven by the political calculus of incumbent governments: they implement economic policy change if such a choice is not expected to reduce their chances to retain power. This implies a non-monotonic relationship between the level of political competition and the extent of economic reform. We test this hypothesis using data for 102 countries over the period 1980 to 2005.

Next, we measure the contribution of intangible capital to growth for 2000-08. We find that intangible capital accounts for 23% of labour productivity growth and treating intangibles as investment lowers total factor productivity growth in the 2000s by 24% (R&D lowers it by 3%).","O47,E22,E01","INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY,ECONOMIC-GROWTH","Dal Borgo, Mariela@Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England::Goodridge, Peter@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Imperial Coll Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England::Haskel, Jonathan@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Imperial Coll Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England::Pesole, Annarosa@Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Imperial Coll Business Sch, London SW7 2AZ, England","Dal Borgo, Mariela@University of Warwick::Goodridge, Peter@Imperial College London::Haskel, Jonathan@Imperial College London::Pesole, Annarosa@Imperial College London",not exist,"&lt;IT&gt;UK Intangible Investment: Evidence from the Innovation Index Survey&lt;/IT&gt;+Barnett, D.+Working Paper+2009::The case of the missing productivity growth, or does information technology explain why productivity accelerated in the United States but not in the United Kingdom?+Basu, S; Fernald, JG; Oulton, N; et al.+NBER MACROECONOMICS ANNUAL 2003+2004::INVESTMENT IN HUMAN-CAPITAL - A THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS+BECKER, GS+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1962::Beyond computation: Information technology, organizational transformation and business performance+Brynjolfsson, E; Hitt, LM+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+FAL 2000::Survey-based measures of software investment in the UK+Chesson, A.; Chamberlin, G.+&lt;IT&gt;Economic Trends&lt;/IT&gt;+2006::Measuring capital and technology - An expanded framework+Corrado, C; Hulten, C; Sichel, D+MEASURING CAPITAL IN THE NEW ECONOMY+2005::Measuring Intangible Capital and its Contribution to Economic Growth in Europe+Corrado, C.; Hulten, C.; Hao, J.

We apply a gravity model that accounts for firm heterogeneity and multilateral resistance to an international logistics index. A one standard deviation improvement in logistics is equivalent to a 14% reduction in distance. An average-sized developing country would raise exports by approximately 36%. Most of the countries are much smaller than average, so the typical effect is 8%. This difference is chiefly due to the dampening effect of multilateral resistance, which is more important for small countries.","F10,F13,F14,F17,O24","GRAVITY EQUATION,TRANSPORT COSTS,TRADE,FIRMS","Behar, Alberto@Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA::Manners, Philip@Ctr Int Econ, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia::Nelson, Benjamin D.@Bank England, London EC2R 8AH, England","Behar, Alberto@International Monetary Fund::Manners, Philip@Unknow::Nelson, Benjamin D.@Bank of England",not exist,"Gravity with gravitas: A solution to the border puzzle+Anderson, JE; van Wincoop, E+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 2003::THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR THE GRAVITY EQUATION+ANDERSON, JE+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1979::Trade costs+Anderson, JE; van Wincoop, E+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+SEP 2004::no title+Arvis, JF; Mustra, MA; Panzer, J<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Ojala, L; Naula, T</span>.+Connecting to compete: trade logistics in the global economy+2007::Approximating general equilibrium impacts of trade liberalizations using the gravity equation: Applications to NAFTA and the European Economic Area+Baier, S.L.; Bergstrand, J.H.+The Gravity Model in International Trade.

Network Effects and Infrastructure Productivity in Developing Countries,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00722.x,DEC 2013,28,5,"This study proposes to investigate the threshold effects in the productivity of infrastructure investment in developing countries. It concludes to their presence in the relationship between output and private and public inputs as well as network effects in the productivity of infrastructure. When the available stock of infrastructure is low, investment has the same productivity as non-infrastructure investment. On the contrary, when a minimum network is available, the marginal productivity of infrastructure investment is greater than the productivity of other investments. Finally, when the main network is achieved, its marginal productivity becomes similar to the productivity of other investment.","C82,E22,E62","PUBLIC-EXPENDITURE,INFERENCE,REGRESSION,PANEL,EFFICIENT,PUZZLE","Candelon, Bertrand@Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands::Colletaz, Gilbert@Univ Orleans, LEO UMR CNRS 6221, LEO, Orleans, France::Hurlin, Christophe@Univ Orleans, LEO UMR CNRS 6221, LEO, Orleans, France","Candelon, Bertrand@Maastricht University::Colletaz, Gilbert@Universite de Orleans::Hurlin, Christophe@Universite de Orleans",not exist,"A NORMATIVE ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC CAPITAL+AI, CR; CASSOU, SP+APPLIED ECONOMICS+DEC 1995::IS PUBLIC-EXPENDITURE PRODUCTIVE+ASCHAUER, DA+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAR 1989::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::International Data on Educational Attainment.

Profit sharing may affect training because it is a credible commitment by firms to reward firm-specific skills, may reduce turnover and leads to peer group pressure to participate in training courses. To eliminate possible selectivity effects, we combine matching with difference-in-differences. We identify the proportion of employees participating in profits and differentiate profit sharing according to the percentage of the workers covered. Using German establishment data we find that profit sharing only has a significant effect on training intensity if the majority of the workforce benefits from it.","C14,J33,M52,J24","RESOURCE MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES,PROPENSITY SCORE,FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE,MATCHING METHODS,PRODUCTIVITY,INVESTMENT,WAGES,GERMANY,IMPACT,INFORMATION","Kraft, Kornelius@TU Dortmund, Dept Econ Business & Social Sci, IZA, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany@ZEW, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Lang, Julia@TU Dortmund, Dept Econ Business & Social Sci, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","Kraft, Kornelius@Dortmund University of Technology@IZA Institute Labor Economics::Lang, Julia@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"Beyond Becker: Training in imperfect labour markets+Acemoglu, D; Pischke, JS+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+FEB 1999::The structure of wages and investment in general training+Acemoglu, D; Pischke, JS+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+JUN 1999::TRAINING IN EUROPE+Arulampalam, Wiji; Bryan, Mark L.; Booth, Alison L.+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION+APR 5 2004::Profit-sharing, employment stability, and wage growth+Azfar, O; Danninger, S+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+APR 2001::no title+Becker,, G.

The empirical results provide support to the wage-supervision trade-off prediction of the shirking model and suggest that the NMW may have operated as an efficiency wage in the care homes sector, leading to a reduction in supervision costs. These findings can explain earlier evidence suggesting that although the NMW introduction increased wages dramatically in the care homes sector, it generated only moderate negative employment effects.","J31,J38,J41","FAST-FOOD INDUSTRY,GIFT EXCHANGE,SUPERVISION,UNEMPLOYMENT,PAY,DISCIPLINE,EMPLOYMENT,BOSSES","Georgiadis, Andreas@Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 3TB, England","Georgiadis, Andreas@Unknow",not exist,"LABOR CONTRACTS AS PARTIAL GIFT EXCHANGE+AKERLOF, GA+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+1982::Training and the new minimum wage+Arulampalam, W; Booth, AL; Bryan, ML+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAR 2004::no title+Autor, D.+Efficiency Wages, Neoclassical and Non-Neoclassical Evidence+2003::A THEORY OF DUAL LABOR-MARKETS WITH APPLICATION TO INDUSTRIAL-POLICY, DISCRIMINATION, AND KEYNESIAN UNEMPLOYMENT+BULOW, JI; SUMMERS, LH+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JUL 1986::HIERARCHY, ABILITY, AND INCOME-DISTRIBUTION+CALVO, GA; WELLISZ, S+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1979::AN INTERPLANT TEST OF THE EFFICIENCY WAGE HYPOTHESIS+CAPPELLI, P; CHAUVIN, K+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1991::MINIMUM-WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT - A CASE-STUDY OF THE FAST-FOOD INDUSTRY IN NEW-JERSEY AND PENNSYLVANIA+CARD, D; KRUEGER, AB+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1994::no title+Card, D.; Krueger, A.+Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage+1995::no title+no author+ANN REP ACC PER 1 AP+2011::CAN UNEMPLOYMENT BE INVOLUNTARY - COMMENT+CARMICHAEL, L+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1985::Efficiency wage models of unemployment-one view+Carmichael, L.+Economic Inquiry+1990::Are Efficiency Wages Efficient?+Dickens, W.; Katz, L.; Lang, K.+Working Paper no. 1935+1985::Minimum Wages and Firm Profitability+Draca, Mirko; Machin, Stephen; Van Reenen, John+AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-APPLIED ECONOMICS+JAN 2011::Wage rigidity in a competitive incomplete contract market+Fehr, E; Falk, A+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+FEB 1999::DOES FAIRNESS PREVENT MARKET CLEARING - AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION+FEHR, E; KIRCHSTEIGER, G; RIEDL, A+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1993::no title+Georgiadis, A.+Efficiency Wages in Low-Wage Labour Markets and the Economic Effects of the Minimum Wage+2006::Putting behavioral economics to work: Testing for gift exchange in labor markets using field experiments+Gneezy, Uri; List, John A.+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2006::BOSSES OF DIFFERENT STRIPES - A CROSS-NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON MONITORING AND SUPERVISION+GORDON, DM+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1994::WHO BOSSES WHOM - THE INTENSITY OF SUPERVISION AND THE DISCIPLINE OF LABOR+GORDON, DM+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1990::THE STRUCTURE OF SUPERVISION AND PAY IN HOSPITALS+GROSHEN, EL; KRUEGER, AB+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+FEB 1990::Job queues and wages+Holzer, H.; Katz, L.; Krueger, A.+Quarterly Journal of Economics+1991::EFFICIENCY WAGES AND THE INTER-INDUSTRY WAGE STRUCTURE+KRUEGER, AB; SUMMERS, LH+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1988::OWNERSHIP, AGENCY, AND WAGES - AN EXAMINATION OF FRANCHISING IN THE FAST-FOOD INDUSTRY+KRUEGER, AB+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 1991::no title+Laing, W.+Calculating the Costs of Efficient Care Homes+2008::CARROTS AND STICKS - PAY, SUPERVISION, AND TURNOVER+LEONARD, JS+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+OCT 1987::no title+no author+The National Minimum Wage and Training+2008::Minimum wages in a low-wage labour market: Care homes in the UK+Machin, S; Wilson, J+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAR 2004::A test of competitive labor market theory: the wage structure among care assistants in the south of England+Machin, S.; Manning, A.+Industrial and Labor Relations Review+2004::Where the minimum wage bites hard: introduction of minimum wages to a low wage sector+Machin, S.; Manning, A.; Rahman, L.+Journal of the European Economic Association+2003::HOW DO WE KNOW THAT REAL WAGES ARE TOO HIGH+MANNING, A+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 1995::A Simple Test of the Shirking Model+Manning, A.; Thomas, J.+Working Paper No. 374+1997::The impact of the national minimum wage on the pay distribution, employment and training+Metcalf, D+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAR 2004::Why has the British National Minimum Wage had Little or no Effect on Employment+Metcalf, D.+Working Paper No. 781+2007::no title+Odiorne, G.

We deploy a control function approach to the problem that involves conditioning elapsed duration on completed unemployment duration in the reservation wage equation.

Alternative forecasting approaches for different information sets are compared with benchmark univariate autoregressive models, and substantial out-performance is demonstrated including against Stock and Watson's unobserved components-stochastic volatility model. Three key ingredients to the out-performance are: including equilibrium correction component terms in relative prices; introducing nonlinearities to proxy state-dependence in the inflation process and replacing the information criterion, commonly used in VARs to select lag length, with a parsimonious longer lags' parameterization. Forecast pooling or averaging also improves forecast performance.","E31,E37,E52,C22,C51,C52,C53","KEYNESIAN PHILLIPS-CURVE,EURO AREA,MULTISTEP ESTIMATION,INTEREST-RATES,PRICES,ERRORS,DYNAMICS,STICKY,MODELS","Aron, Janine@Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England@Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England::Muellbauer, John@Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England@Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England","Aron, Janine@University of Oxford::Muellbauer, John@University of Oxford",not exist,"Sectoral and aggregate inflation dynamics in the euro area+Altissimo, F; Matha, T; Bilke, L; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION+APR-MAY 2006::Sticky prices in the euro area: A summary of new micro-evidence+Alvarez, LJ; Martins, F; Dhyne, E; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION+APR-MAY 2006::New evidence on inflation persistence and price stickiness in the euro area: Implications for macro modeling+Angeloni, Ignazio; Gali, Jordi; Aucremanne, Luc; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION+APR-MAY 2006::US deflation?

Time Horizons and Smoothing in the Bank of England's Reaction Function: The Contrast Between the Standard GMM and Ex Ante Forecast Approaches,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00709.x,OCT 2013,22,0,"The monetary policy reaction function of the Bank of England is estimated by the standard GMM approach and the ex ante forecast method developed by Goodhart (2005), with particular attention to the horizons for inflation and output at which each approach gives the best fit. The horizons for the ex ante approach are much closer to what is implied by the Bank's view of the transmission mechanism, while the GMM approach produces an implausibly slow adjustment of the interest rate, and suffers from a weak instruments problem. These findings suggest a strong preference for the ex ante approach.","E43,E52","MONETARY-POLICY RULES,MODELS","Cobham, David@Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Management & Languages, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland::Kang, Yue@Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Management & Languages, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland","Cobham, David@Heriot Watt University::Kang, Yue@Heriot Watt University","Cobham, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8208-3716","Monetary frameworks and institutional constraints: UK monetary policy reaction functions, 1985-2003+Adam, C; Cobham, D; Girardin, E+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 2005::USING REAL-TIME OUTPUT GAPS TO EXAMINE PAST AND FUTURE POLICY CHOICES+Adam, Christopher; Cobham, David+NATIONAL INSTITUTE ECONOMIC REVIEW+OCT 2009::no title+no author+The transmission mechanism of monetary policy+1999::The formulation of monetary policy at the Bank of England+Bean, C; Jenkinson, N.+Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin+2001::What monetary authorities do-an examination of reaction functions for Germany, Japan, the UK and the US+Chadha, J.; Janssen, N.+Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics+1997::Monetary policy rules in practice - Some international evidence+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1998::Monetary policy rules and macroeconomic stability: Evidence and some theory+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2000::Why does the Monetary Policy Committee smooth interest rates?+Cobham, D+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JUL 2003::no title+Cobham, D.+The Making of Monetary Policy in the UK, 1975-2000+2002::Time Horizons and Smoothing in the Bank of England's Reaction Function: The Contrast Between the Standard GMM and Ex Ante Forecast Approaches+Cobham, D.; Kang, Y.+Working paper+April 2012::Monetary Policy Inertia: More a Fiction than a Fact?+Consolo, A.; Favero, C.+CEPR Discussion Paper no. 7341+2009::TESTING IDENTIFIABILITY AND SPECIFICATION IN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE MODELS+CRAGG, JG; DONALD, SG+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 1993::no title+Favero, C.

A No-Arbitrage Structural Vector Autoregressive Model of the UK Yield Curve,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12001,OCT 2013,32,1,"This article combines a Structural Vector Autoregression with a no-arbitrage approach to build a multifactor Affine Term Structure Model (ATSM). The resulting No-Arbitrage Structural Vector Autoregressive (NASVAR) model implies that expected excess returns are driven by structural macroeconomic shocks. This is in contrast with a standard ATSM, in which agents are concerned with non-structural risks. As a simple application, we study the effects of supply, demand and monetary policy shocks on the UK yield curve. We show that all structural shocks affect the slope of the yield curve, with demand and supply shocks accounting for a large part of the time variation in bond yields.","C32,E43,E44","TERM-STRUCTURE DYNAMICS,MONETARY-POLICY,INTEREST-RATES,PREMIA,US","Kaminska, Iryna@Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA","Kaminska, Iryna@International Monetary Fund",not exist,"New estimates of the UK real and nominal yield curves+Anderson, N; Sleath, J.+Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin+1999::What does the yield curve tell us about GDP growth?+Ang, A; Plazzesi, M; Wei, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR-APR 2006::A no-arbitrage vector autoregression of term structure dynamics with macroeconomic and latent variables+Ang, A; Piazzesi, M+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 2003::no title+Ang, A.; Dong, S.; Piazzesi, M.+No-Arbitrage Taylor Rules+2005::The term structure of real rates and expected inflation+Ang, Andrew; Bekaert, Geert; Wei, Min+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+APR 2008::Measuring monetary policy with VAR models: An evaluation+Bagliano, FC; Favero, CA+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1998::New Keynesian macroeconomics and the term structure+Bekaert, G.; Cho, S.; Moreno, A.+Journal of Money, Credit and Banking+2010::An empirical characterization of the dynamic effects of changes in government spending and taxes on output+Blanchard, O; Perotti, R+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2002::THE DYNAMIC EFFECTS OF AGGREGATE DEMAND AND SUPPLY DISTURBANCES+BLANCHARD, OJ; QUAH, D+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1989::no title+Canova, F.+Methods for Applied Macroeconomic Research+2007::Maximum likelihood estimation for a multifactor equilibrium model of the term structure of interest rates+Chen, R.; Scott, L.+Journal of Fixed Income+1993::Monetary policy shocks: what have we learned and to what end?+Christiano, L.

Exchange Rate Pass-through to Trade Prices: The Role of Nonlinearities and Asymmetries,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00711.x,OCT 2013,27,42,"A standard assumption in the empirical literature is that exchange rate pass-through is both linear and symmetric. This study tests these assumptions for export and import prices in the G7 economies. It focuses on non-linearities in the reaction of profit margins to exchange rate movements, which may arise from the presence of price rigidities and switching costs. Nonlinearities are characterized by augmenting a standard linear model with polynomial functions of the exchange rate and with interactive dummy variables. The results suggest that nonlinearities and especially asymmetries cannot be ignored, although their magnitude varies noticeably across countries.","F3,F4,F14,C22",IMPORT PRICES,"Bussiere, Matthieu@Banque France, F-75001 Paris, France","Bussiere, Matthieu@Unknow",not exist,"The U.

What does a Monetary Policy Shock Do? An International Analysis with Multiple Filters,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00712.x,OCT 2013,50,3,"What does a monetary policy shock do? We answer this question by estimating a new-Keynesian monetary policy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for a number of economies with a variety of empirical proxies of the business cycle. The effects of two different policy shocks, an unexpected interest rate hike conditional on a constant inflation target and an unpredicted drift in the inflation target, are scrutinized. Filter-specific Bayesian impulse responses are contrasted with those obtained by combining multiple business cycle indicators. Our results document the substantial uncertainty surrounding the estimated effects of these two policy shocks across a number of countries.

Truncated Product Methods for Panel Unit Root Tests,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00705.x,AUG 2013,33,12,"This paper proposes two new panel unit root tests based on Zaykin et al. (2002)'s truncated product method. The first one assumes constant correlation between P-values and the second one uses sieve bootstrap to allow for general forms of cross-section dependence in the panel units. Monte Carlo simulation shows that both tests have reasonably good size and are powerful in cases of some very large P-values. The proposed tests are applied to a panel of real GDP and inflation density forecasts, resulting in evidence that professional forecasters may not update their forecast precision in an optimal Bayesian way.","C12,C33","BOOTSTRAP,POWER,COINTEGRATION,DEPENDENCE,VALUES","Sheng, Xuguang@American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA::Yang, Jingyun@Penn State Univ, Methodol Ctr, State Coll, PA 16801 USA","Sheng, Xuguang@American University::Yang, Jingyun@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University",not exist,"A panic attack on unit roots and cointegration+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2004::Panel unit root tests and spatial dependence+Baltagi, Badi H.; Bresson, Georges; Pirotte, Alain+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+MAR 2007::Some cautions on the use of panel methods for integrated series of macroeconomic data+Banerjee, A.; Marcellino, M.; Osbat, C.+Econometrics Journal+2004::no title+BREITUNG J+ECONOMETRICS PANEL D+2008::Bootstrap unit root tests in panels with cross-sectional dependency+Chang, Y+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2004::A sieve bootstrap for the test of a unit root+Chang, Y; Park, JY+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+JUL 2003::LAG ORDER AND CRITICAL-VALUES OF THE AUGMENTED DICKEY-FULLER TEST+CHEUNG, YW; LAI, KS+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1995::Combination Unit Root Tests for Cross-Sectionally Correlated Panels+Choi, I.+Econometric Theory and Practice: Frontiers of Analysis and Applied Research, Essays in Honor of Peter C.

Early smoking is found to be a strong and valid IV and unlike previous IV strategies uses variations in education at numerous points across the distributions of (i) education, and (ii) ability. Thus whilst still a local average treatment effect' the estimate is closer to the average effect of additional education, akin to least squares but corrected for endogeneity.","I20,J30","WEAK INSTRUMENTS,RETURNS,SMOKING,AVERAGE,BEHAVIOR,UK","Dickson, Matt@Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Geary Inst, Dublin 4, Ireland","Dickson, Matt@University College Dublin",not exist,"Does smoking really harm your earnings so much?

Retirement Choices in Italy: What an Option Value Model Tells Us,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00701.x,AUG 2013,44,2,"Using Italian data, we estimate an option value model to quantify the effect of financial incentives on retirement choices. As far as we know, this is the first empirical study to estimate the conditional multiple-years model put forward by Stock and Wise (1990). This implies that we account for dynamic self-selection bias. We also present an extended version of this model in which the marginal value of leisure is random. For the female sample, the model is able to predict almost perfectly the age-specific hazard rates. For the male sample, we obtain a good fit. Dynamic self-selection results in a downward bias in the estimate of the marginal utility of leisure. We perform a simulation study to gauge the effects of a dramatic pension reform. Underestimation of the value of leisure translates into sizeable over-prediction of the impact of reform. Due to lack of data, results for males should be interpreted with caution since we are not able to fully correct for dynamic self-selection bias.","J26,H55,C33,C34,C35","SOCIAL-SECURITY,PENSION INCENTIVES,BEHAVIOR,WEALTH,EXPECTATIONS,INCOME,MEN","Belloni, Michele@CeRP Coll Carlo Alberto & Netspar, I-10024 Moncalieri, TO, Italy::Alessie, Rob@Univ Groningen, Netspar & Tinbergen Inst, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands","Belloni, Michele@Unknow::Alessie, Rob@University of Groningen",not exist,"no title+Bellman, R.

However, these high estimates emerge from pooling non-entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs, without controlling for heterogeneity. This article provides evidence for Germany based on representative panel data that includes private wealth balance sheets. Entrepreneurs, who face high income risk, hold more wealth than employees, but this tendency is not because of precautionary motives. Instead, they appear to save more for their old age, because they are usually not covered by statutory pension insurance. The analysis accounts for endogeneity in entrepreneurial choice and heterogeneous risk attitudes.","D91,D12,E21","LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS,SELF-EMPLOYMENT,BUSINESS OWNERS,WEALTH,VARIABILITY,BEHAVIOR,MODEL,PANEL","Fossen, Frank M.@Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany@German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany::Rostam-Afschar, Davud@Free Univ Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany@DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Fossen, Frank M.@Free University of Berlin@DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung::Rostam-Afschar, Davud@Free University of Berlin@DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung","Rostam-Afschar, Davud@I-6153-2015","Precautionary saving and income uncertainty in Germany - New evidence from microdata+Bartzsch, Nikolaus+JAHRBUCHER FUR NATIONALOKONOMIE UND STATISTIK+FEB 2008::What makes an entrepreneur?+Blanchflower, DG; Oswald, AJ+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JAN 1998::Theoretical Foundations of Buffer Stock Saving+Carroll, C.

Hierarchical Modelling of Disparities in Preferences for Redistribution,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00703.x,AUG 2013,55,13,"We evaluate the magnitude of the disparities in the demand for redistribution across European countries and American states during the 2000s. Modelling the demand for redistribution in a multilevel framework, we identify the determinants that contribute the most in predicting support for redistribution. We observe that individual characteristics and contextual variables are associated with demand for redistribution in the same way in Europe and in the US, whereas others exert different influences on the probability of supporting redistribution. We find important differences from some well-established evidence obtained from data collected for the 1980s and the 1990s.","C3,D31,D6","INCOME INEQUALITY,ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT,MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS,WELFARE ATTITUDES,SOCIAL-MOBILITY,PUBLIC SUPPORT,REGIMES,DEMAND,HYPOTHESIS,GOVERNMENT","Pittau, Maria Grazia@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat Sci, I-00185 Rome, Italy::Massari, Riccardo@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Social Sci, I-00185 Rome, Italy::Zelli, Roberto@Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat Sci, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Pittau, Maria Grazia@Sapienza University Rome::Massari, Riccardo@Sapienza University Rome::Zelli, Roberto@Sapienza University Rome","Massari, Riccardo@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3548-8862::ZELLI, Roberto@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1967-3470","STATISTICAL MODELING ISSUES IN SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES+AITKIN, M; LONGFORD, N; PLEWIS, IF; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1986::Fairness and redistribution+Alesina, A; Angeletos, GM+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 2005::Fractionalization+Alesina, A; Devleeschauwer, A; Easterly, W; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH+JUN 2003::Preferences for redistribution in the land of opportunities+Alesina, A; La Ferrara, E+JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS+JUN 2005::Inequality and happiness: are Europeans and Americans different?+Alesina, A; Di Tella, R; MacCulloch, R+JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS+AUG 2004::Preferences for Redistribution+Alesina, A.; Giuliano, P.+NBER Working Paper No. 14825+2009::no title+ALESINA, ALBERTO; GLAESER, EDWARD L.+FIGHTING POVERTY IN THE US AND EUROPE: A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE+2004::Statistical Modelling of Data on Teaching Styles+Anderson, Dorothy; Aitkin, Murray; Hinde, John.+Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (General)+1981::Trade Openness and Preferences for Redistribution: A Cross-National Assessment of the Compensation Hypothesis+Balcells Ventura, Laia.+Business and Politics+2006::Belief in a just world and redistributive politics+Benabou, R; Tirole, J+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 2006::Social mobility and the demand for redistribution: The POUM hypothesis+Benabou, R; Ok, EA+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 2001::Public attitudes toward welfare state policies: A comparative analysis of 24 nations+Blekesaune, M; Quadagno, J+EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+DEC 2003::More equal but less mobile?

Measuring Inflation Expectations Using Interval-Coded Data,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00704.x,AUG 2013,36,2,"To quantify qualitative survey data, the Carlson-Parkin method assumes normality, a time-invariant symmetric indifference interval, and long-run unbiased expectations. These assumptions are unnecessary for interval-coded data. In April 2004, the Monthly Consumer Confidence Survey in Japan started to ask households about their price expectations a year ahead in seven categories with partially known boundaries. Thus one can identify up to six parameters including an indifference interval each month. This paper compares normal, skew normal (SN), skew exponential power (SEP), and skew t (St) distributions, and finds that an St distribution fits the data well. The results help us to better understand the dynamics of heterogeneous expectations.","C25,C46,C82,E31","CONSUMER PRICE-INDEX,STICKY INFORMATION,PANEL-DATA,DISTRIBUTIONS,MODELS,LIKELIHOOD,UNCERTAINTY","Murasawa, Yasutomo@Osaka Prefecture Univ, Sch Econ, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan","Murasawa, Yasutomo@Osaka Prefecture University","Murasawa, Yasutomo@F-6327-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6716-0162","Do macro variables, asset markets, or surveys forecast inflation better?+Ang, Andrew; Bekaert, Geert; Wei, Min+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 2007::Log-skew-normal and log-skew-t distributions as model for family income data+Azzalini, A.; Dal Cappello, T.; Kotz, S.+J.

Using a specially assembled data set, our GMM results suggest that improvements in the risk management standards attained by some hospitals are correlated with reductions in their MRSA infection rates.

Based on a collective model of the household, we developed reduced-form and structural-form estimation equations that allow us to focus on private goods to track the changes in intrahousehold resource allocation. We found one additional child is associated with a reduction in the wife's private expenditure share by at least two percentage points.

The study uses data from two rounds of Nepal Living Standard Surveys and a Population Census and examine how the choice of a migration destination is influenced by various covariates, including income differentials across possible destinations. We find that migrants move primarily to nearby, high population density areas where many people share their language and ethnic background. Better access to amenities is significant as well. Differentials in average income across destination districts are significant in univariate comparisons but not once we control for other covariates. Differentials in consumption expenditures are statistically significant but smaller in magnitude than other determinants. It is differentials in absolute, not relative, consumption between destination districts that are correlated with the destination of work migrants. Except for the latter, results are robust to different specifications and datasets.",,"UNITED-STATES,SUBJECTIVE WELFARE,INTERNAL MIGRATION,SELF-SELECTION","Fafchamps, Marcel@Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England::Shilpi, Forhad@World Bank, DECRG, Washington, DC 20433 USA","Fafchamps, Marcel@University of Oxford::Shilpi, Forhad@The World Bank",not exist,"no title+Akee, R.

It is shown that, regardless of whether effects (i) are treated as parameters or as an error term, (ii) are estimated in different stages of a hierarchical model, or whether (iii) correlation between effects and regressors is allowed, when the same prior information on idiosyncratic parameters is introduced into all estimation methods, the resulting common slope estimator is also the same across methods. These results are illustrated using the Grunfeld investment data with different prior distributions. Random effects estimates are shown to be more efficient than fixed effects estimates. This efficiency gain, however, comes at the cost of neglecting information obtained in the computation of the prior unknown variance of idiosyncratic parameters.",,"TIME SERIES DATA,ERROR COMPONENTS MODELS,COMBINING CROSS SECTION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,LINEAR MODEL","Rendon, Silvio R.@SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Rendon, Silvio R.@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@State University of New York (SUNY) System",not exist,"POOLING CROSS SECTION AND TIME SERIES DATA IN ESTIMATION OF A DYNAMIC MODEL - DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS+BALESTRA, P; NERLOVE, M+ECONOMETRICA+1966::no title+Baltagi, B.

Assessing the Transmission of Monetary Policy Using Time-varying Parameter Dynamic Factor Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2011.00687.x,APR 2013,40,21,"This article extends the current literature which questions the stability of the monetary transmission mechanism, by proposing a factor-augmented vector autoregressive (VAR) model with time-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility. The VAR coefficients and error covariances may change gradually in every period or be subject to abrupt breaks. The model is applied to 143 post-World War II quarterly variables fully describing the US economy. I show that both endogenous and exogenous shocks to the US economy resulted in the high inflation volatility during the 1970s and early 1980s. The time-varying factor augmented VAR produces impulse responses of inflation which significantly reduce the price puzzle. Impulse responses of other indicators of the economy show that the most notable changes in the transmission of unanticipated monetary policy shocks occurred for gross domestic product, investment, exchange rates and money.",,"US ECONOMY,INFERENCE,VOLATILITY,OUTPUT","Korobilis, Dimitris@Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium","Korobilis, Dimitris@Universite Catholique Louvain","Korobilis, Dimitris@P-4532-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9146-3008","THE FEDERAL-FUNDS RATE AND THE CHANNELS OF MONETARY TRANSMISSION+BERNANKE, BS; BLINDER, AS+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1992::Monetary policy in a data-rich environment+Bernanke, BS; Boivin, J+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+APR 2003::Measuring the effects of monetary policy: A factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) approach+Bernanke, BS; Boivin, J; Eliasz, P+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2005::no title+Boivin, J.; Giannoni, M.

Does the Order and Timing of Active Labour Market Programmes Matter?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12007,APR 2013,51,4,"This study extends the traditional focus of active labour market policy evaluation from a static comparison of participation in a programme versus non-participation (or participation in another programme) to the evaluation of the effects of programme sequences, that is, multiple participation or timing of such programmes. Explicitly allowing for dynamic selection into different stages of such programme sequences we analyse multiple programmes, the timing of programmes, and the order of programmes. The analysis is based on comprehensive administrative data on the Austrian labour force. Our findings suggest that (i) active job search programmes are more effective after a qualification programme compared to the reverse order, (ii) multiple participation in qualification measures dominates single participation and (iii) the effectiveness of several labour market programmes deteriorates the later they start during an unemployment spell.",,"JOB CREATION SCHEMES,TRAINING-PROGRAMS,PROPENSITY SCORE,CAUSAL INFERENCE,EAST-GERMANY,EMPLOYMENT,MODELS,HETEROGENEITY,EFFICIENCY,EXPOSURE","Lechner, Michael@Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Empir Econ Res SEW HSG, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland::Wiehler, Stephan@Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Empir Econ Res SEW HSG, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland","Lechner, Michael@University of St Gallen::Wiehler, Stephan@University of St Gallen","Lechner, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4308-1579","Active Labor Market Policy Effects for Women in Europe+Bergemann, A.; van den Berg, G.+IZA discussion paper, No. 2365+2006::Sectoral heterogeneity in the employment effects of job creation schemes in Germany+Caliendo, M; Hujer, R; Thomsen, SL+JAHRBUCHER FUR NATIONALOKONOMIE UND STATISTIK+MAR 2006::New evidence on the effects of job creation schemes in Germany-A matching approach with threefold heterogeneity+Caliendo, M.; Hujer, R.; Thomsen, S.+Research in Economics+2004::Identifying effect heterogeneity to improve the efficiency of job creation schemes in Germany+Caliendo, Marco; Hujer, Reinhard; Thomsen, Stephan L.+APPLIED ECONOMICS+2008::The relative efficiency of labor market programs: Swedish experience from the 1990s+Carling, K; Richardson, K+LABOUR ECONOMICS+JUN 2004::Self Employment Grants vs. Subsidized Employment: Is There a Difference in the Re-Employment Risk?+Carling, K.; Gustafson, L.+Working Paper+1999::Moving the goalposts: Addressing limited overlap in the estimation of average treatment effects by changing the estimand+Crump, R.

We show that women are less confident in their entrepreneurial skills, have different social networks and exhibit higher fear of failure than men. After controlling for endogeneity, we find that these variables explain a substantial part of the gender gap in entrepreneurial activity.

Pension Funding Constraints and Corporate Expenditures,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00693.x,APR 2013,32,3,This paper examines the impact of a company's pension contributions (PCs) on its dividend and investment policies. The effects of shocks to cash flows on these corporate expenditures are identified by changes to pension funding regulations. Using a sample of DB pension schemes in FTSE350 UK-listed firms we find a strong negative relation between PCs and corporate dividends even after controlling for the correlation between funding status and unobserved investment opportunities. We find that the more stringent funding requirements under the Pensions Act 2004 had a more pronounced effect on both dividend and investment sensitivities to PCs.,,"CAPITAL STRUCTURE,PANEL-DATA,FINANCING CONSTRAINTS,INVESTMENT,DIVIDENDS,MODELS,PLANS,FIRMS,DECISIONS","Liu, Weixi@Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China@Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England::Tonks, Ian@Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Liu, Weixi@University of Exeter@Renmin University of China::Tonks, Ian@University of Bath","Tonks, Ian@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4503-5149","ANOTHER LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+ARELLANO, M; BOVER, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::On the marginal source of investment funds+Auerbach, A.; Hassett, K.+Journal of Public Economics+2002::When Does the Market Matter?

It is shown that business and capital market cycles jointly are causal for the merger cycle but the capital market cycle alone is not, suggesting that merger cycles may reflect disequilibria and/or market mis-valuation.

Asymptotic properties of these estimators and the related t-tests and model selection criteria are studied by sending the number of cross-sectional observations to infinity. This article shows that the first-differenced and Within-OLS estimators diverge in probability, that the related t-tests are inconsistent, that R2s converge to zero in probability and that AIC and BIC diverge to in probability.

A Canonical Correlation Approach for Selecting the Number of Dynamic Factors,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12003,FEB 2013,30,9,"In this article, we propose a selection procedure that allows us to consistently estimate the number of dynamic factors in a dynamic factor model. The procedure is based on a canonical correlation analysis of the static factors which has the advantage of being invariant to a rescaling of the factors. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the proposed selection rule outperforms existing ones, in particular, if the contribution of the common factors to the overall variance is moderate or low.

Testing the Number of Factors: An Empirical Assessment for a Forecasting Purpose,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12010,FEB 2013,27,7,"GDP forecasts based on dynamic factor models, applied to a large data set, are now widely used by practitioners involved in nowcasting and short-term macroeconomic forecasting. One recurrent empirical question that arises when dealing with such models is the way to determine the optimal number of factors. At the same time, statistical tests have recently been put forward in the literature in order to optimally determine the number of significant factors. In this article, we propose to reconcile both fields of interest by selecting the number of factors, through a testing procedure, to include in the forecasting equation. Through an empirical exercise on French and German GDPs, we assess the impact of a battery of recent statistical tests for the number of factors for a forecasting purpose. By implementing a rolling experience, we also assess the stability of the results overtime.",,"APPROXIMATE FACTOR MODELS,DYNAMIC FACTOR MODEL,PANEL,GDP","Barhoumi, Karim@Middle East Ctr Econ & Finance, Int Monetary Fund, Salmiya 22003, Symphony Mall, Kuwait::Darne, Olivier@Univ Nantes & Banque France, LEMNA, IEMN IAE, F-44322 Nantes, France::Ferrara, Laurent@Directorate Gen Econ & Int Relat, Int Macroecon Div, F-75049 Paris, France","Barhoumi, Karim@Unknow::Darne, Olivier@Unknow::Ferrara, Laurent@Unknow",not exist,"Improved penalization for determining the number of factors in approximate factor models+Alessi, Lucia; Barigozzi, Matteo; Capasso, Marco+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+DEC 1 2010::Consistent estimation of the number of dynamic factors in a large N and T panel+Amengual, Dante; Watson, Mark W.+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2007::Determining the number of factors in approximate factor models+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::Determining the number of primitive shocks in factor models+Bai, Jushan; Ng, Serena+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2007::Are Disaggregate Data Useful for Factor Analysis in Forecasting French GDP?+Barhoumi, Karim; Darne, Olivier; Ferrara, Laurent+JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JAN-MAR 2010::Forecasting Euro Area Recessions using Time-Varying Binary Response Models for Financial Variables+Bellego, C.; Ferrara, L.+Working Paper No. 259+2009::Measuring the effects of monetary policy: A factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) approach+Bernanke, BS; Boivin, J; Eliasz, P+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2005::Understanding and comparing factor based forecasts+Boivin, J.; Ng, S.+International Journal of Central Banking+2005::A Canonical Correlation Approach for Selecting the Number of Dynamic Factors+Breitung, J.; Pigorsch, U.+Working paper+2010::Direct multi-step estimation and forecasting+Chevillon, Guillaume+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS+SEP 2007::Comparing Alternative Predictors Based on Large-Panel Factor Models+D'Agostino, Antonello; Giannone, Domenico+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+APR 2012::A quasi maximum likelihood approach for large approximate dynamic factor models+Doz, C; Giannone, D; Reichlin, L.+The Review of Economics and Statistics+2011::A two-step estimator for large approximate dynamic factor models based on Kalman filtering+Doz, Catherine; Giannone, Domenico; Reichlin, Lucrezia+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 1 2011::The generalized dynamic factor model consistency and rates+Forni, M; Hallin, M; Lippi, M; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 2004::The generalized dynamic factor model: One-sided estimation and forecasting+Forni, M; Hallin, M; Lippi, M; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2005::OPENING THE BLACK BOX: STRUCTURAL FACTOR MODELS WITH LARGE CROSS SECTIONS+Forni, Mario; Giannone, Domenico; Lippi, Marco; et al.+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+OCT 2009::Tests of conditional predictive ability+Giacomini, Raffaella; White, Halbert+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2006::Nowcasting: The real-time informational content of macroeconomic data+Giannone, Domenico; Reichlin, Lucrezia; Small, David+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 2008::Determining the number of factors in the general dynamic factor model+Hallin, Marc; Liska, Roman+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2007::A Testing Procedure for Determining the Number of Factors in Approximate Factor Models With Large Datasets+Kapetanios, George+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2010::Pooling Versus Model Selection for Nowcasting GDP With Many Predictors: Empirical Evidence for Six Industrialized Countries+Kuzin, V.+Journal of Applied Econometrics+2012::A comparison of direct and iterated multistep AR methods for forecasting macroeconomic time series+Marcellino, Massimiliano; Stock, James H.; Watson, Mark W.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV-DEC 2006::Factor MIDAS for Nowcasting and Forecasting with Ragged-Edge Data: A Model Comparison for German GDP*+Marcellino, Massimiliano; Schumacher, Christian+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 2010::TESTING HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FACTORS IN LARGE FACTOR MODELS+Onatski, Alexei+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2009::DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF FACTORS FROM EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF EIGENVALUES+Onatski, Alexei+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 2010::Macroeconomic forecasting using diffusion indexes+Stock, JH; Watson, MW+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 2002::Implications of Dynamic Factor Models for VAR Analysis+Watson, M; Stock, J.+NBER Working Paper No. 11467.+2005"

The Global Dimension of Inflation - Evidence from Factor-Augmented Phillips Curves,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12004,FEB 2013,61,5,We examine the global dimension of inflation in 24 OECD countries between 1980 and 2007 in a Phillips curve framework. We decompose output gaps and changes in unit labour costs into common (or global) and idiosyncratic components using a factor analysis and introduce these components separately in the regression. We find that the common component of changes in unit labour costs has a notable impact on inflation. Movements in import price inflation (not driven by oil supply) and foreign competition and global interest rate developments also affect inflation. Policy makers need to carefully observe those variables when assessing inflation developments.,,"OPEN-ECONOMY,EURO AREA,MONETARY-POLICY,COST CHANNEL,US INFLATION,MODELS,GLOBALIZATION,DYNAMICS,TESTS,TRANSMISSION","Eickmeier, Sandra@Econ Res Ctr, Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany::Pijnenburg, Katharina@Deutsch Inst Wirtschaftsforsch Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany","Eickmeier, Sandra@Unknow::Pijnenburg, Katharina@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Anderton, R.; Galesi, A.; Lombardi, M.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; di Mauro, F</span>.+Key Elements of Global Inflation+2009::no title+ATKESON A+FEDERAL RESERVE BANK+2001::Computation and analysis of multiple structural change models+Bai, J; Perron, P+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 2003::Determining the number of factors in approximate factor models+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::Has globalization changed inflation?+Ball, L.+NBER Working Paper, no. 12687+2006::An open-economy new Keynesian Phillips curve for the UK+Batini, N; Jackson, B; Nickell, S+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+SEP 2005::no title+BENATI L+COMPUTING EC FINANCE+2003::Does immigration affect the Phillips curve?

Punishing the Foreigner: Implicit Discrimination in the Premier League Based on Oppositional Identity,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00725.x,FEB 2013,25,7,"We present the first empirical study to reveal the presence of implicit discrimination in a non-experimental setting. By using a large dataset of in-match data in the English Premier League, we show that white referees award significantly more yellow cards against non-white players of oppositional identity. We argue that this is the result of implicit discrimination by showing that this discriminatory behaviour: (i) increases in how rushed the referee is before making a decision, and (ii) it increases in the level of ambiguity of the decision. The variation in (i) and (ii) cannot be explained by any form of conscious discrimination such as taste-based or statistical discrimination. Moreover, we show that oppositional identity players do not differ in their behaviour from other players along several dimensions related to aggressiveness and style of play providing further evidence that this is not statistical discrimination.",,"RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION,FOOTBALL,FAVORITISM,REFEREES,MARKET,BIAS","Gallo, Edoardo@Univ Cambridge, Dept Econ, Cambridge CB3 9ET, England@Queens Coll, Cambridge CB3 9ET, England::Grund, Thomas@Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Dept Sociol, Oxford OX1 1NF, England::Reade, J.

The auxiliary use of US state-level data significantly reduces the upward bias in cross-country estimates of technical efficiency, and so does allowing for imperfect substitutability between skilled and unskilled labour. We then use our adjusted estimate of the world technology frontier in a series of decompositions of productivity differences and sources of economic growth in the OECD in 19702000, including also appropriate technology vs. efficiency decompositions.","E23,O11,O14,O33,O47","TECHNICAL CHANGE,APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY,RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS,OUTPUT GROWTH,CONVERGENCE,COUNTRIES,EFFICIENCY,MODELS,BOOTSTRAP,EDUCATION","Growiec, Jakub@Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland@Natl Bank Poland, Poland & Econ Inst, Warsaw, Poland","Growiec, Jakub@Warsaw School of Economics","Growiec, Jakub@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2222-1691","NEW VIEW OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE+ATKINSON, AB; STIGLITZ, JE+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+1969::Bias-Corrected Production Frontiers: Application to Productivity Growth and Convergence+Badunenko, O .; Henderson, D.

We provide evidence for an unskilled labour abundant developing country by employing dynamic heterogeneous panel estimation techniques. For South African manufacturing, trade-mandated increases in earnings are positive for labour and negative for capital whilst technology-mandated increases are negative for both factors. We also find it important to take account of endogeneity issues in analysing the impact of technology and price changes on factor returns and in isolating factor- and sector-bias of technological changes.","C23,C33,F16","DYNAMIC HETEROGENEOUS PANELS,WAGE INEQUALITY,DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES,PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH,LIBERALIZATION,IMPACT,SECTOR,MEXICO,GLOBALIZATION,DIFFERENTIALS","Fedderke, Johannes@Penn State Univ, Econ Res So Africa, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Witwatersrand, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa::Shin, Yongcheol@Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England::Vaze, Prabhat@Minist Def, Moscow, Russia","Fedderke, Johannes@University of Witwatersrand@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Shin, Yongcheol@University of Leeds::Vaze, Prabhat@Unknow","Fedderke, Johannes@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4482-5939","Testing Creative Destruction in an Opening Economy: The Case of the South African Manufacturing Industries+Aghion, P.; Fedderke, J.

In contrast, we model the migration decision within the context of potential destinations, combining British panel data over the period 19922008 with other data sources. Contrary to earlier micro studies, we show that differences in house prices levels (but not growth) are important determinants of household migration for homeowners. Unemployed individuals respond to regional differences in expected individual wages, whereas the employed are more sensitive to employment opportunities. Our evidence is consistent with partners of heads of households being tied migrants.","R23,J61","REGIONAL MIGRATION,FAMILY MIGRATION,RESIDENTIAL-MOBILITY,GREAT-BRITAIN,UNEMPLOYMENT,DETERMINANTS,SELECTION,LABOR,DECISIONS,MARKET","Rabe, Birgitta@Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO3 4SG, Essex, England::Taylor, Mark P.@Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO3 4SG, Essex, England","Rabe, Birgitta@University of Essex::Taylor, Mark P.@University of Essex","Rabe, Birgitta@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8632-0088","The determinants of regional migration in Great Britain: a duration approach+Andrews, Martyn; Clark, Ken; Whittaker, William+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2011::Regional migration in Spain: The effect of personal characteristics and of unemployment, wage and house price differentials using pooled cross-sections+Antolin, P; Bover, O+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 1997::Is unemployment really scarring?

Inequality and poverty depth would have increased, and the sharp fall in child poverty would not have occurred, had the reforms of income support and tax credits not been implemented.","H23,H53,I32","CHILD POVERTY,INEQUALITY,UK,COMPONENTS,BRITAIN,REFORM","Bargain, Olivier@Aix Marseille Univ, DEFI, F-13290 Les Milles, France","Bargain, Olivier@University of Aix-Marseille",not exist,"The distributional effects of tax and benefit reforms since 1997+Adam, S.; Wakefield, M.+chapter 7 of the Green Budget+2005::no title+Adam, S; Browne, J.+Redistribution, work incentives and thirty years of UK tax and benefit reform, IFS Working Paper 10/24+2010::EUROMOD and the development of EU Social Policy.+Atkinson, A.B.+EUROMOD working paper 1/05+2005::no title+Bargain, O.+Decomposition Analysis of Distributive Policies using Behavioural Simulations+2011::Micro-Simulation in Action+no author+MICRO-SIMULATION IN ACTION+2006::The labour market impact of the working families' tax credit+Blundell, R.; Duncan, A.; McCrae, J.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Meghir, C</span>.+Fiscal Studies+2000::no title+Blundell, Richard; Brewer, Mike; Shephard, Andrew.+Evaluating the Labour Market Impact of Working Families' Tax Credit Using Differences-in-Differences+2005::What really happened to child poverty in the UK under Labour's first term?+Brewer, M; Clark, T; Goodman, A+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JUN 2003::Poverty and inequality in Britain: 2004+Brewer, M.; Goodman, A.; Myck, M.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Shaw, J.; Shephard, A</span>.+Institute for Fiscal Studies, commentary paper 96+2004::Effects of tax-benefit changes on inequality trends in Europe: A decomposition approach+Callan, T.; Bargain, O.+Journal of Economic Inequality+2008::ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF TAX/TRANSFER POLICY CHANGES ON POVERTY: METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES AND SOME EUROPEAN EVIDENCE+Callan, Tim; Coleman, Kieran; Walsh, John+MICRO-SIMULATION IN ACTION+2006::no title+Chantreuil, F.; Trannoy, A.+Inequality Decomposition Values+1997::Inequality and two decades, of British tax and benefit reforms+Clark, T; Leicester, A+FISCAL STUDIES+JUN 2004::no title+Creedy, J.; Herault, N.+Decomposing inequality and social welfare changes using behavioural microsimulation: An application to Australia+2011::Progressivity comparisons+Dardanoni, V; Lambert, PJ+JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS+OCT 2002::GROWTH AND REDISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN POVERTY MEASURES - A DECOMPOSITION WITH APPLICATIONS TO BRAZIL AND INDIA IN THE 1980S+DATT, G; RAVALLION, M+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+APR 1992::Poverty and Social Exclusion in the EU after Laeken-Part 1+Dennis, I.; Guio, A.-C.+Statistics in Focus Theme 3 8/2003+2003::Child poverty in Britain and the United States+Dickens, R; Ellwood, DT+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JUN 2003::The socioeconomic consequences of ""in-work"" benefit reform for British lone mothers+Francesconi, Marco; van der Klaauw, Wilbert+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+WIN 2007::no title+Goodman, A.; Johnson, P.; Webb, S.+Inequality in the UK+1997::How European Union member states adjust tax and benefit systems for inflation+Gutierrez, R; Immervoll, H; Sutherland, H.+EUROMOD Working Paper+2005::no title+Hills, J.+Inequality and the State+2004::no title+Hills, J.; Sefton, T.; Stewart, K.+Towards a More Equal Society?: Poverty, Inequality and Policy Since 1997+2009::Falling up the stairs: The effects of ""bracket creep"" on household incomes+Immervoll, H+REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH+MAR 2005::Accounting for income distribution trends: A density function decomposition approach+Jenkins, S.; van Kerm, P.+Journal of Economic Inequality+2005::ACCOUNTING FOR INEQUALITY TRENDS - DECOMPOSITION ANALYSES FOR THE UK, 1971-86+JENKINS, SP+ECONOMICA+FEB 1995::A decomposition analysis of regional poverty in Russia+Kolenikov, S; Shorrocks, A+REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+FEB 2005::Base independence in the analysis of tax policy effects: with an application to Norway 1992-2004+Lambert, Peter J.; Thoresen, Thor O.+INTERNATIONAL TAX AND PUBLIC FINANCE+APR 2009::Social Indicator and Other Income Statistics using the Euromod Baseline: A Comparison with Eurostat and National Statistics+Mantovani, D.; Sutherland, H.+Euromod Working Paper, EM1/03+2003::A DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS OF THE TREND IN UK INCOME INEQUALITY+MOOKHERJEE, D; SHORROCKS, A+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+1982::THE BENEFITS AND PROBLEMS OF LINKING MICRO AND MACRO MODELS - EVIDENCE FROM A FLAT TAX ANALYSIS+Peichl, Andreas+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMICS+NOV 2009::Simulating the reform of means-tested benefits with endogenous take-up and claim costs+Pudney, S; Hancock, R; Sutherland, H+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+APR 2006::no title+Shorrocks, A.

At the typical business cycle frequency range the link is only present until the beginning of the 1980s.

Does Productivity Decline After Promotion?

As, once promotion decisions are known, most external incentives vanish for promoted candidates, their productivity was expected to decrease. This hypothesis was tested by using an original dataset and matching methods to evaluate the impact of promotion on publication scores. The robustness of the matching estimates was tested using sensitivity analysis. The results clearly show that the removal of extrinsic incentives following promotion does not lead to a fall in productivity in French academia.","M51,J24,J45","ECONOMETRIC EVALUATION ESTIMATOR,GENDER-DIFFERENCES,PROPENSITY-SCORE,INCENTIVES,SENSITIVITY,HUMANITIES,MOTIVATION,PROGRAM,SALARY","Sabatier, Mareva@Univ Savoie, IAE Savoie Mont Blanc IREGE, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France","Sabatier, Mareva@University of Savoie",not exist,"COMPENSATION AND INCENTIVES - PRACTICE VS THEORY+BAKER, GP; JENSEN, MC; MURPHY, KJ+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUL 1988::Thinks Can Only Get Worse?

Bootstrap HAC Tests for Ordinary Least Squares Regression,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2011.00671.x,DEC 2012,30,2,There is a need for tests that are derived from the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators of regression coefficients and are useful in the presence of unspecified forms of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. A method that uses the moving block bootstrap and quasi-estimators in order to derive a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix for the OLS estimators and robust significance tests is proposed. The method is shown to be asymptotically valid and Monte Carlo evidence indicates that it is capable of providing good control of significance levels in finite samples and good power compared with two other bootstrap tests.,"C12,C22","COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION,LINEAR-REGRESSION,HETEROSKEDASTICITY,CONSISTENCY,ESTIMATORS,KERNEL,ERRORS,MODEL","Bravo, Francesco@Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England::Godfrey, Leslie G.@Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Bravo, Francesco@University of York - UK::Godfrey, Leslie G.@University of York - UK",not exist,"AN IMPROVED HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATOR+ANDREWS, DWK; MONAHAN, JC+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1992::HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::Inference with Dependent Data Using Cluster Covariance Estimators+Bester, C.

Rather than identifying the causal effect of parental education via instrumental variables we exploit the feature of the transmission mechanism responsible for its endogeneity. More explicitly, we assume the intergenerational transfer of unobserved ability is invariant to the economic environment. This, combined with the heteroskedasticity resulting from the interaction of unobserved ability with socioeconomic factors, identifies the causal effect. We conclude that the observed intergenerational educational correlation reflects both a causal parental educational effect and a transfer of unobserved ability.",,,"Farre, Lidia@Inst Anal Econ, Bellaterra, Spain::Klein, Roger@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA::Vella, Francis@Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA","Farre, Lidia@CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE)@Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)::Klein, Roger@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Vella, Francis@Georgetown University",not exist,"Does increasing women's schooling raise the schooling of the next generation?

The Flexible Fourier Form and Local Generalised Least Squares De-trended Unit Root Tests,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2011.00665.x,OCT 2012,24,22,"In two recent papers Enders and Lee (2009) and Becker, Enders and Lee (2006) provide Lagrange multiplier and ordinary least squares de-trended unit root tests, and stationarity tests, respectively, which incorporate a Fourier approximation element in the deterministic component. Such an approach can prove useful in providing robustness against a variety of breaks in the deterministic trend function of unknown form and number. In this article, we generalize the unit root testing procedure based on local generalized least squares (GLS) de-trending proposed by Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock (1996) to allow for a Fourier approximation to the unknown deterministic component in the same way. We show that the resulting unit root tests possess good finite sample size and power properties and the test statistics have stable non-standard distributions, despite the curious result that their limiting null distributions exhibit asymptotic rank deficiency.",,"EFFICIENT TESTS,HYPOTHESIS,BREAKS","Rodrigues, Paulo M.

Evidence from a Field Experiment,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2011.00664.x,AUG 2012,42,50,"We conduct a large-scale field experiment to measure labour market discrimination in Australia, one quarter of whose population was born overseas. To denote ethnicity, we use distinctively Anglo-Saxon, Indigenous, Italian, Chinese and Middle Eastern names. We compare multiple ethnic groups, rather than a single minority as in most other studies. In all cases we applied for entry-level jobs and submitted a CV indicating that the candidate attended high school in Australia. We find significant differences in callback rates: ethnic minority candidates would need to apply for more jobs in order to receive the same number of interviews. These differences vary systematically across ethnic groups.","J71,C93","LABOR-MARKET,RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION,AUSTRALIA,DOCTORS","Booth, Alison L.@Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England@Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia::Leigh, Andrew@Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia::Varganova, Elena@Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Booth, Alison L.@University of Essex@Australian National University::Leigh, Andrew@Australian National University::Varganova, Elena@Australian National University","Leigh, Andrew@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5639-0509","What has economics to say about racial discrimination?+Arrow, KJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+SPR 1998::Employee Earnings and Hours+no author+Cat No 6306.0+2009::no title+Becker, Gary.+The Economics of Discrimination+1971::no title+Berman, G.+Harnessing Diversity: Addressing racial and religious discrimination in employment+2008::Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal?

A Unit Root Test Using a Fourier Series to Approximate Smooth Breaks,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2011.00662.x,AUG 2012,20,119,"We develop a unit-root test based on a simple variant of Gallant's (1981) flexible Fourier form. The test relies on the fact that a series with several smooth structural breaks can often be approximated using the low frequency components of a Fourier expansion. Hence, it is possible to test for a unit root without having to model the precise form of the break. Our unit-root test employing Fourier approximation has good size and power for the types of breaks often used in economic analysis. The appropriate use of the test is illustrated using several interest rate spreads.","C12,C22,E17","MULTIPLE STRUCTURAL-CHANGES,HYPOTHESIS,MODELS,STATIONARITY","Enders, Walter@Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA::Lee, Junsoo@Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Enders, Walter@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@University of Alabama System::Lee, Junsoo@University of Alabama Tuscaloosa@University of Alabama System",not exist,"AN LM TEST FOR A UNIT-ROOT IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRUCTURAL-CHANGE+AMSLER, C; LEE, JS+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 1995::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::A general test for time dependence in parameters+Becker, R; Enders, W; Hurn, S+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+NOV-DEC 2004::A stationarity test in the presence of an unknown number of smooth breaks+Becker, R; Enders, W; Lee, J+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+MAY 2006::Testing the unit root with drift hypothesis against nonlinear trend stationarity, with an application to the US price level and interest rate+Bierens, HJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1997::HYPOTHESIS-TESTING WHEN A NUISANCE PARAMETER IS PRESENT ONLY UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE+DAVIES, RB+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1987::Unit-root tests and asymmetric adjustment with an example using the term structure of interest rates+Enders, W; Granger, CWJ+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1998::ON THE BIAS IN FLEXIBLE FUNCTIONAL FORMS AND AN ESSENTIALLY UNBIASED FORM - THE FOURIER FLEXIBLE FORM+GALLANT, AR+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1981::Inference in TAR models+Hansen, BE+STUDIES IN NONLINEAR DYNAMICS AND ECONOMETRICS+APR 1997::Testing for nonlinear deterministic components when the order of integration is unknown+Harvey, David I.; Leybourne, Stephen J.; Xiao, Lisa+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+SEP 2010::Testing for a unit root in the nonlinear STAR framework+Kapetanios, G; Shin, Y; Snell, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 2003::Unit Roots and Smooth Transitions+Leybourne, S.; Newbold, P.; Vougas, D.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1998::UNIT-ROOT TESTS IN ARMA MODELS WITH DATA-DEPENDENT METHODS FOR THE SELECTION OF THE TRUNCATION LAG+NG, S; PERRON, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1995::THE GREAT CRASH, THE OIL PRICE SHOCK, AND THE UNIT-ROOT HYPOTHESIS+PERRON, P+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1989::Further evidence on breaking trend functions in macroeconomic variables+Perron, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 1997::TESTING FOR A UNIT-ROOT IN TIME-SERIES REGRESSION+PHILLIPS, PCB; PERRON, P+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1988::Potentia pitfalls in determining multiple structural changes with an application to purchasing power parity+Prodan, Ruxandra+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2008::LM TESTS FOR A UNIT-ROOT IN THE PRESENCE OF DETERMINISTIC TRENDS+SCHMIDT, P; PHILLIPS, PCB+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1992::Tests for asymmetry in possibly nonstationary time series data+Shin, DW; Lee, O+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 2001::On the Asymptotic Normality of Fourier Flexible Form Estimates+Souza, G.; Gallant, R.+Journal of Econometrics+1991"

We show that this distribution belongs to the family of (positive) Gram-Charlier (GC) densities and thus it preserves all the good properties of this type of SNP distributions but with a much simpler structure. The in- and out-of-sample performance of the PES is compared with symmetric and skewed GC distributions and other widely used densities in economics and finance. The results confirm the PES as a good alternative to approximate financial returns distribution, specially when skewness is not severe.","C16,C53,G12","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY,VOLATILITY MODELS,OPTION VALUATION,TIME-SERIES,ESTIMATORS,RETURN,TESTS,RISK","Niguez, Trino-Manuel@Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, London NW1 5LS, England::Perote, Javier@Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ, Salamanca 37007, Spain","Niguez, Trino-Manuel@University of Westminster::Perote, Javier@University of Salamanca","Perote, Javier@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9122-4370","no title+Abramowitz, M; Stegun, A.+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS F+1972::Comparing density forecasts via weighted likelihood ratio tests+Amisano, Gianni; Giacomini, Raffaella+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 2007::Predicting the volatility of the S&amp;P-500 stock index via GARCH models: the role of asymmetries+Awartani, BMA; Corradi, V+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JAN-MAR 2005::THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH GRAM-CHARLIER AND EDGEWORTH CURVES ARE POSITIVE DEFINITE AND UNIMODAL+BARTON, DE; DENNIS, KE+BIOMETRIKA+1952::Quasi maximum likelihood estimation and inference in dynamic models with time varying covariances+Bollerslev, T.; Wooldridge, J.M.+Econometric Reviews+1992::GENERALIZED AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY+BOLLERSLEV, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1986::A CONDITIONALLY HETEROSKEDASTIC TIME-SERIES MODEL FOR SPECULATIVE PRICES AND RATES OF RETURN+BOLLERSLEV, T+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1987::Uber die Darstellung willkurlicher Funktionen+Charlier, C.

Workers retain a share of individual productivity shocks and high-efficiency workers receive compensation for greater effort. Collective bargaining can mitigate the effect of performance pay on wage inequality by easing monitoring of common effort standards and group-based pay schemes. Analyses of longitudinal employeremployee data show that the introduction of performance-related pay raises wage inequality in non-union firms, but not in firms with high union density. Although performance-related pay appears to be on the rise, the overall impact on wage dispersion is likely to be small, particularly in European countries with influential unions.","J31,J33","INCENTIVES,EARNINGS,PRODUCTIVITY,COSTS","Barth, Erling@Inst Social Res, N-0208 Oslo, Norway::Bratsberg, Bernt@Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, N-0349 Oslo, Norway::Haegeland, Torbjorn@Stat Norway, N-0033 Oslo, Norway::Raaum, Oddbjorn@Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, N-0349 Oslo, Norway","Barth, Erling@Unknow::Bratsberg, Bernt@Unknow::Haegeland, Torbjorn@Statistics Norway::Raaum, Oddbjorn@Unknow",not exist,"Social preferences and the response to incentives: Evidence from personnel data+Bandiera, O; Barankay, I; Rasul, I+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 2005::Union wage effects: does membership matter?+Barth, E.; Naylor, R.; Raaum, O.+The Manchester School+2001::Who pays for performance?+Barth, Erling; Bratsberg, Bernt; Haegeland, Torbjorn; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER+2008::Performance pay, monitoring environments, and establishment performance+Belfield, R; Marsden, D+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER+2003::Changes over time in union relative wage effects in the UK and the US revisited+Blanchflower, D; Bryson, A.+INT HDB TRADE UNIONS+2003::Collectivism Versus Individualism: Performance-Related Pay and Union Coverage for Non-standard Workers in Britain+Booth, A.

It is found that the blackwhite earnings gap declined moderately after the implementation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in 1965. Based on the simulation studies of wage trajectories, it is also found that the positive impact of the Civil Rights Act on the convergence of the blackwhite earnings gap is especially significant for the group of middle-aged and highly educated workers. Moreover, the rich dynamic structure of the earnings process is identified from the Current Population Survey-Social Security Administration data set. It is shown that the various sources of dynamics in the earnings process are dominated by spurious state dependence for both blacks and whites.","C15,C23,C24,J15,J18",MODELS,"Chang, Sheng-Kai@Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 100, Taiwan","Chang, Sheng-Kai@National Taiwan University","CHANG, SHENG-KAI@M-2173-2018@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5710-1000","BLACK-WHITE EARNINGS RATIOS SINCE THE CIVIL-RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 - THE IMPORTANCE OF LABOR-MARKET DROPOUTS+BROWN, C+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+1984::Simulation estimation of two-tiered dynamic panel Tobit models with an application to the labor supply of married women+Chang, S.-K.+Journal of Applied Econometrics+2011::A computationally practical simulation estimation for dynamic panel Tobit models+Chang, S-K.+Academia Economic Papers+2011::Estimation of semiparametric censored regression models - An application to changes in black-white earnings inequality during the 1960s+Chay, KY; Honore, BE+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+WIN 1998::Changes in the Labor Market for Black Americans, 1948-72+Freeman, RB; Gordon, RA; Bell, D<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Hall, RE</span>.+Brookings Papers on Economic Activity+1973::An empirical analysis of earnings dynamics among men in the PSID: 1968-1989+Geweke, J; Keane, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2000::SIMULATION-BASED INFERENCE - A SURVEY WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO PANEL-DATA MODELS+GOURIEROUX, C; MONFORT, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 1993::The method of simulated scores for the estimation of LDV models+Hajivassiliou, VA; McFadden, DL+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1998::Statistical Models for Discrete PanelData+Heckman, J.

To correctly identify the monetary policy shock, we distinguish between a standard policy rate shifter and a shock to trend inflation, i.e. the time-varying inflation target set by the Fed. Our estimated models predict a negative inflation reaction to a monetary policy tightening.

We test for differences between trade and non-trade regimes by using generalized reduced rank regression (GRRR) techniques suggested by Hansen (2003). We apply these techniques to semi-weekly price and trade flow data for tomato markets in Zimbabwe and find that intermarket price adjustment occurs in both trade and non-trade periods. Indeed, the adjustments are generally larger and more rapid in periods without physical trade flows. This finding underscores the importance of information flow for market performance.","Q13,R12,C32,P42","MARKET INTEGRATION,THRESHOLD COINTEGRATION,ERROR-CORRECTION,MODEL","Stephens, Emma C.@Pitzer Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA::Mabaya, Edward@Cornell Univ, Emerging Markets Program, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA::von Cramon-Taubadel, Stephan@Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany::Barrett, Christopher B.@Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Stephens, Emma C.@Pitzer College::Mabaya, Edward@Cornell University::von Cramon-Taubadel, Stephan@University of Gottingen::Barrett, Christopher B.@Cornell University","Barrett, Christopher@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9139-2721","Threshold cointegration+Balke, NS; Fomby, TB+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+AUG 1997::Testing for cointegrating rank via model selection: evidence from 165 data sets+Baltagi, Badi H.; Wang, Zijun+EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS+2007::Distinguishing between equilibrium and integration in spatial price analysis+Barrett, CB; Li, JR+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+MAY 2002::Market analysis methods: Are our enriched toolkits well suited to enlivened markets?+Barrett, CB+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+AUG 1996::Measuring Integration and Efficiency in International Agricultural Markets+Barrett, Christopher B.+Review of Agricultural Economics+2001::Transfer costs, spatial arbitrage, and testing for food market integration+Baulch, B+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+MAY 1997::Identifying, estimating and testing restricted cointegrated systems: An overview+Boswijk, HP+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+NOV 2004::The impact of market and policy instability on price transmission between wheat and flour in Ukraine+Bruemmer, Bernhard; von Cramon-Taubadel, Stephan; Zorya, Sergiy+EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+JUN 2009::A model of spatial arbitrage with transport capacity constraints and endogenous transport prices+Coleman, A.+American Journal of Agricultural Economics+2009::Competitive storage and commodity price dynamics+Deaton, A; Laroque, G+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 1996::ON MARKET INTEGRATION AND LIBERALIZATION - METHOD AND APPLICATION TO ETHIOPIA+DERCON, S+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES+OCT 1995::Dynamic Price Adjustment in Spatially Separated Food Markets with Transaction Costs+Dercon, S.; van Campenhout, B.+Working Paper+1999::COINTEGRATION AND ERROR CORRECTION - REPRESENTATION, ESTIMATION, AND TESTING+ENGLE, RF; GRANGER, CWJ+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1987::Spatial price analysis+Fackler, P.

Local projection techniques are more robust to this problem, and Monte Carlo evidence has suggested they provide reliable estimates of the true impulse responses. We use local linear projections to investigate the dynamic properties of a model for a small open economy, New Zealand. We compare impulse responses from projections to those from standard techniques, and consider the implications for monetary policy.

We recursively evaluate quasi out-of-sample forecasts from a large suite of models from 1999 to 2009. The performance of the models are then used to derive quasi real time weights that are used to combine the forecasts. Our results indicate that a combination forecast improves upon the point forecasts from individual models. Furthermore, a combination forecast outperforms Norges Bank's own point forecast for inflation. The beneficial results are obtained using a trimmed weighted average. Some degree of trimming is required for the combination forecasts to outperform the judgmental forecasts from the policymaker.","E52,E37,E47","INFERENCE,MODELS","Bjornland, Hilde C.@Norwegian Sch Management BI, NO-0442 Oslo, Norway::Gerdrup, Karsten@Norges Bank, Oslo, Norway::Jore, Anne Sofie@Norges Bank, Oslo, Norway::Smith, Christie@Reserve Bank New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand::Thorsrud, Leif Anders@Norwegian Sch Management BI, NO-0442 Oslo, Norway","Bjornland, Hilde C.@BI Norwegian Business School::Gerdrup, Karsten@Unknow::Jore, Anne Sofie@Unknow::Smith, Christie@Unknow::Thorsrud, Leif Anders@BI Norwegian Business School",not exist,"no title+Aastveit, K.

Combining both UIRP and EHTS in a model that allows for nonlinearities, we investigate whether the Swiss advantage is disappearing with respect to Europe. Our results favour threshold cointegration and show that both hypotheses hold, at least in one of the three regimes of the process for Switzerland/Germany.

New Evidence on Class Size Effects: A Pupil Fixed Effects Approach,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2011.00648.x,APR 2012,22,12,"The impact of class size on student achievement remains a thorny question for educational decision makers. Meta-analyses of empirical studies emphasize the absence of class-size effects but detractors have argued against such pessimistic conclusions because many of the underlying studies have not paid attention to the endogeneity of class size. This article uses a stringent method to address the endogeneity problem using Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study data on 47 countries. We measure the class size effect by relating the difference in a student's achievement across subjects to the difference in his/her class size across subjects. This (subject-differenced) within-pupil achievement production function avoids the problem of the non-random matching of children to specific schools, and to classes within schools. The results show a statistically significant negative effect of class size in 14 countries, but the effect size is small in most cases. Several robustness tests are carried out, including control for students subject-specific ability and subject-specific teacher characteristics, and correction for possible measurement error. Thus, our approach to addressing the endogeneity problem confirms the findings of meta-analyses that find little support for class size effects. Additionally, we find that class size effects are smaller in countries with higher teacher quality.","I21,H52","STRATIFIED SAMPLES,ACHIEVEMENT,COUNTRIES,WORLD","Altinok, Nadir@Univ Nancy 2, Dept Econ BETA CNRS, Fac Droit Sci Econ & Gest, F-54035 Nancy, France::Kingdon, Geeta@Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1H 0PD, England","Altinok, Nadir@Universite de Lorraine::Kingdon, Geeta@University College London@University of London",not exist,"Pupil-Teacher Gender Interaction Effects on Scholastic Outcomes in England and the USA+Ammermuller, A.; Dolton, P.+Center for European Economic Research (ZEW) Discussion Paper 06-060+2007::Using Maimonides' rule to estimate the effect of class size on scholastic achievement+Angrist, JD; Lavy, V+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1999::What can Teachers do to Raise Pupil Achievement?+Aslam, M.; Kingdon, G.+CSAE Working Papers Series, 2007-14+2007::Teachers and Gender Gaps in Student Achievement+Dee, T.+NBER Working Paper 11660+2005::USING SAMPLE SURVEY WEIGHTS IN MULTIPLE-REGRESSION ANALYSES OF STRATIFIED SAMPLES+DUMOUCHEL, WH; DUNCAN, GJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::The failure of input-based schooling policies+Hanushek, EA+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+FEB 2003::Efficiency and equity in schools around the world+Hanushek, EA; Luque, JA+ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW+OCT 2003::Assessing the effects of school resources on student performance: An update+Hanushek, EA+EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION AND POLICY ANALYSIS+SUM 1997::School Resources+Hanushek, Eric A.+HDB EC ED+2006::Is the Gender Gap in School Performance Affected by the Sex of the Teacher?+Holmlund, H.; Sund, K.+Swedish Institute for Social Research (SOFI) Working Paper 5+2005::The effects of class size on student achievement: New evidence from population variation+Hoxby, CM+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2000::Teacher Characteristics and Student Performance in India: A Pupil Fixed Effects Approach+Kingdon, G.+GPRG WORKING PAPER S+2006::Teacher unions, teacher pay and student performance in India: A pupil fixed effects approach+Kingdon, Geeta; Teal, Francis+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+MAR 2010::Randomized evaluations of educational programs in developing countries: Some lessons+Kremer, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2003::Experimental estimates of education production functions+Krueger, AB+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1999::Understanding the magnitude and effect of class size on student achievement+Krueger, Alan.+The class size debate+2002::Schooling quality in a cross-section of countries+Lee, JW; Barro, RJ+ECONOMICA+NOV 2001::no title+no author+&lt;IT&gt;Education at a Glance, 2005&lt;/IT&gt;+2005::Natural ""Natural experiments"" in economics+Rosenzweig, MR; Wolpin, KI+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+DEC 2000::On the specification and estimation of the production function for cognitive achievement+Todd, PE; Wolpin, KI+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+FEB 2003::Asymptotic properties of weighted M-estimators for standard stratified samples+Wooldridge, JM+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+APR 2001::Class-size effects in school systems around the world: Evidence from between-grade variation in TIMSS+Wossmann, L; West, M+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+APR 2006"

Diagnostic Tests of Cross-section Independence for Limited Dependent Variable Panel Data Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2011.00646.x,APR 2012,18,18,"This article considers the problem of testing for cross-section independence in limited dependent variable panel data models. It derives a Lagrangian multiplier (LM) test and shows that in terms of generalized residuals of Gourieroux (1987) it reduces to the LM test of Breusch and Pagan (1980). Because of the tendency of the LM test to over-reject in panels with large N (cross-section dimension), we also consider the application of the cross-section dependence test (CD) proposed by Pesaran (2004). In Monte Carlo experiments it emerges that for most combinations of N and T the CD test is correctly sized, whereas the validity of the LM test requires T (time series dimension) to be quite large relative to N. We illustrate the cross-sectional independence tests with an application to a probit panel data model of roll-call votes in the US Congress and find that the votes display a significant degree of cross-section dependence.","C12,C33,C35",,"Hsiao, Cheng@Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA@Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Xiamen Univ, WISE, Xiamen, Peoples R China::Pesaran, M.

Integrated processes and short-memory models with trending components, possibly affected by structural breaks, imply similar features in the data and, accordingly, are hard to distinguish. The goal of this article is to extend the classical testing framework of I(1) versus I(0) + trends and/or breaks by considering a more general class of models under the null hypothesis: fractionally integrated (FI) processes. The asymptotic properties of the proposed tests are derived and it is shown that they are very well-behaved in finite samples.

Alternative methods of modelling thresholds are explored. An endogenous threshold model is shown to be preferable to the use of interaction effects. The results identify critical levels of natural barriers which affect how greater openness or liberalization impacts on productivity growth. We find that only countries with higher natural barriers receive growth benefits from trade liberalization.","O49,F13","ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT,EXPORT EXPANSION,TRANSPORT COSTS,CROSS-COUNTRY,INSTITUTIONS,GEOGRAPHY,PANEL,PRODUCTIVITY,INTEGRATION,POLICY","Henry, Michael@Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England::Kneller, Richard@Univ Nottingham, GEP, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Milner, Chris@Univ Nottingham, GEP, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Girma, Sourafel@Univ Nottingham, GEP, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Henry, Michael@University of Birmingham::Kneller, Richard@University of Nottingham::Milner, Chris@University of Nottingham::Girma, Sourafel@University of Nottingham","Kneller, Richard@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4542-5358::Girma, Sourafel@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5815-1619","The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S; Robinson, JA+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2001::Evidence on growth, increasing returns, and the extent of the market+Ades, AF; Glaeser, EL+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1999::Economic integration and political disintegration+Alesina, A; Spolaore, E; Wacziarg, R+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2000::no title+BARRO RJ+J ECON GROWTH+1996::no title+Barro, Robert J.+Determinants of Economic Growth+1997::Openness can be good for growth: The role of policy complementarities+Chang, Roberto; Kaltani, Linda; Loayza, Norman V.+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+SEP 2009::Causality and Feedback Between Institutional Measures and Economic Growth+Chong, Alberto; Calderon, Cesar.+Economics and Politics+2000::Port efficiency, maritime transport costs, and bilateral trade+Clark, XM; Dollar, D; Micco, A+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+DEC 2004::Institutions, investment, and growth: New cross-country and panel data evidence+Dawson, JW+ECONOMIC INQUIRY+OCT 1998::no title+DRISCOLL J+STATISTICS+1998::MULTIPLE REGIMES AND CROSS-COUNTRY GROWTH-BEHAVIOR+DURLAUF, SN; JOHNSON, PA+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+OCT-DEC 1995::Openness, productivity and growth: What do we really know?+Edwards, S+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAR 1998::Using the gravity equation to differentiate among alternative theories of trade+Feenstra, RC; Markusen, JR; Rose, AK+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE+MAY 2001::An estimate of the effect of common currencies on trade and income+Frankel, J; Rose, A+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 2002::Geography and economic development+Gallup, JL; Sachs, JD; Mellinger, AD+INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW+AUG 1999::no title+GHOSH A+6480 NBER+1998::no title+GREENAWAY D+WELWIRTSCHAFTLICHES+1994::no title+Gwartney, J.

The results show that service offshoring raises the relative demand for high- and medium-skilled workers. Its effects are qualitatively identical, and quantitatively similar, to those of material offshoring. Additional evidence suggests, however, that the two types of offshoring may work through different channels: complementarity between imported services and domestic skills in the case of service offshoring, substitution of low-skilled labour in the case of material offshoring. Overall, the effects are not large in economic terms.","F17,J23","PANEL DATA,UNITED-STATES,GLOBALIZATION,TECHNOLOGY,EMPLOYMENT,VARIABLES,EQUATIONS,TRADE,TESTS,BIAS","Crino, Rosario@Inst Anal Econ, Barcelona 08193, Spain","Crino, Rosario@Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)@CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE)","Crino, Rosario@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8562-1679","Fear of service outsourcing: Is it justified?+Alacer, J.+Economic Policy+2005::Service Offshoring and Productivity: Evidence from the US+Amiti, Mary; Wei, Shang-Jin+WORLD ECONOMY+FEB 2009::Offshoring in a knowledge economy+Antras, P; Garicano, L; Rossi-Hansberg, E+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2006::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::no title+Baldwin, R.+Globalization: The Great Unbundling(s)+2006::Offshoring: General equilibrium effects on wages, production and trade+Baldwin, R.; Robert-Nicoud, F.+Working paper No. 12991+2007::Offshoring and the Onshore Composition of Tasks and Skills+Becker, S.O.; Ekholm, K.; Muendler, M.+Discussion Paper 7391+2009::CHANGES IN THE DEMAND FOR SKILLED LABOR WITHIN UNITED-STATES MANUFACTURING - EVIDENCE FROM THE ANNUAL SURVEY OF MANUFACTURES+BERMAN, E; BOUND, J; GRILICHES, Z+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1994::no title+Berndt, E.

It presents a dataset of fees since 1980 at the European (EPO), the US and the Japanese patent offices. Descriptive statistics show that fees have severely decreased at the EPO over the 1990s, converging towards the level of fees in the US and Japan. The estimation of dynamic panel data models suggests that the price elasticity of demand for patents is about -0.30. These results suggest that the laxity of fee policy at the EPO has significantly contributed to the rising propensity to patent.","O30,O31,O38,O57","PANEL-DATA MODELS,UNIT-ROOT TESTS,ERROR-CORRECTION,SYSTEMS,BIAS","de Rassenfosse, Gaetan@Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia@Univ Melbourne, Intellectual Property Res Inst Australia, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia::de la Potterie, Bruno van Pottelsberghe@Unknow","de Rassenfosse, Gaetan@University of Melbourne::de la Potterie, Bruno van Pottelsberghe@Unknow","de Rassenfosse, Gaetan@A-3051-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7862-0918","no title+ALOGOSKOUFIS G+J ECON SURV+1991::Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk+Bessen, J; Meurer, MJ+PATENT FAILURE: HOW JUDGES, BUREAUCRATS, AND LAWYERS PUT INNOVATORS AT RISK+2008::Approximating the bias of the LSDV estimator for dynamic unbalanced panel data models+Bruno, GSF+ECONOMICS LETTERS+JUN 2005::no title+COHEN W+7553 NBER+2000::The London Agreement and the cost of patenting in Europe+de la Potterie, Bruno van Pottelsberghe; Mejer, Malwina+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS+APR 2010::A brief history of space and time: The scope-year index as a patent value indicator based on families and renewals+de la Potterie, Bruno van Pottelsberghe; van Zeebroeck, Nicolas+SCIENTOMETRICS+MAY 2008::THE ROLE OF FEES IN PATENT SYSTEMS: THEORY AND EVIDENCE+de Rassenfosse, Gaetan; de la Potterie, Bruno van Pottelsberghe+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS+SEP 2013::Per un pugno di dollari: a first look at the price elasticity of patents+de Rassenfosse, Gaetan; de la Potterie, Bruno van Pottelsberghe+OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY+WIN 2007::A policy insight into the R&amp;D-patent relationship+de Rassenfosse, Gaetan; de la Potterie, Bruno van Pottelsberghe+RESEARCH POLICY+JUN 2009::Interntaional patenting and the European Patent Office: a quantitative assessment+Eaton, J.; Kortum, S.; Lerner, J.+OECD C P+2004::Patent systems for encouraging innovation: Lessons from economic analysis+Encaoua, David; Guellec, Dominique; Martinez, Catalina+RESEARCH POLICY+NOV 2006::Patent renewal fees and self-funding patent offices+Gans,, J.; King,, S.; Lampe,, R.+Topics in Theoretical Economics+2004::no title+Guellec, D.; Potterie, B. van Pottelsberghe de la.+The economics of the European patent system+2007::Patent as a market instrument+Guellec, D.; van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, B.; van Zeebroeck, N.+The Economics of the European Patent System: IP Policy for Innovation and Competition+2007::PATENTS AND RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT - IS THERE A LAG+HALL, BH; GRILICHES, Z; HAUSMAN, JA+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1986::The patent paradox revisited: an empirical study of patenting in the US semiconductor industry, 1979-1995+Hall, BH; Ziedonis, RH+RAND JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+SPR 2001::Patent validation at the country level-The role of fees and translation costs+Harhoff, Dietmar; Hoisl, Karin; Reichl, Bettina; et al.+RESEARCH POLICY+NOV 2009::no title+HURLIN C+EC PREVISION+2006::Testing for unit roots in heterogeneous panels+Im, KS; Pesaran, MH; Shin, Y+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 2003::no title+Jaffe, Adam B; Lerner, Joshua.+Innovation and Its Discontents+2004::ON BIAS, INCONSISTENCY, AND EFFICIENCY OF VARIOUS ESTIMATORS IN DYNAMIC PANEL-DATA MODELS+KIVIET, JF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::What is behind the recent surge in patenting?+Kortum, S; Lerner, J+RESEARCH POLICY+JAN 1999::A COMPARATIVE-STUDY OF UNITED-STATES AND JAPANESE PATENT SYSTEMS+KOTABE, M+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES+1992::Unit root tests in panel data: asymptotic and finite-sample properties+Levin, A; Lin, CF; Chu, CSJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 2002::A comparative study of unit root tests with panel data and a new simple test+Maddala, GS; Wu, SW+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1999::DISTRIBUTED LAGS AND ESTIMATION OF LONG-RUN SUPPLY AND DEMAND ELASTICITIES - THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS+NERLOVE, M+JOURNAL OF FARM ECONOMICS+1958::BIASES IN DYNAMIC-MODELS WITH FIXED EFFECTS+NICKELL, S+ECONOMETRICA+1981::Error-correction-based cointegration tests for panel data+Persyn, Damiaan; Westerlund, Joakim+STATA JOURNAL+2008::no title+Rivette, K.

We evaluate its effects in each-year, using an incremental differences-in-differences (IDiD) estimator. Identification is based on variation in the bite of the NMW across local labour markets and the different sized year on year up-ratings. We find that an increased bite of the NMW is associated with falls in lower tail wage inequality. While the average employment effect over the entire period is broadly neutral, there are small but significant positive NMW effects from 2003 onwards.","E24,J31,J42,R12","LABOR-MARKET INSTITUTIONS,IMPACT","Dolton, Peter@Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 OEX, Surrey, England::Bondibene, Chiara Rosazza@Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 OEX, Surrey, England::Wadsworth, Jonathan@Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 OEX, Surrey, England","Dolton, Peter@Royal Holloway University London@University of London::Bondibene, Chiara Rosazza@Royal Holloway University London@University of London::Wadsworth, Jonathan@Royal Holloway University London@University of London",not exist,"How much should we trust differences-in-differences estimates?+Bertrand, M; Duflo, E; Mullainathan, S+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2004::THE EFFECT OF THE MINIMUM-WAGE ON EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT+BROWN, C; GILROY, C; KOHEN, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+1982::USING REGIONAL VARIATION IN WAGES TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF THE FEDERAL MINIMUM-WAGE+CARD, D+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+OCT 1992::no title+Card, D.; Krueger, A.+Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage+1995::Has the national minimum wage reduced UK wage inequality?+Dickens, R; Manning, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2004::The Employment and Hours of Work Effects of the Changing National Minimum Wage+Dickens, R.; Riley, R.; Wilkinson, D.+Research Report for the Low Pay Commission, March, University of Sussex and Centre for Economic Performance+2009::Labor market institutions and the distribution of wages, 1973-1992: A semiparametric approach+DiNardo, J; Fortin, NM; Lemieux, T+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 1996::The geography of the national minimum wage+Dolton, P.; Rosazza-Bondibene, C.; Wadsworth, J.+Low Pay Commission report+2008::no title+HAMERMESH S+IND LABOR RELATIONS+1995::Wage inequality in the United States during the 1980s: Rising dispersion or falling minimum wage?+Lee, DS+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1999::Why has the British national minimum wage had little or no impact on employment?+Metcalf, David+JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS+JUN 2008::Minimum wages and employment+Neumark, D.; Wascher, W.L.+Foundations and Trends in Microeconomics+2007::Minimum wages, labor market institutions, and youth employment: A cross-national analysis+Neumark, D; Wascher, W+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+JAN 2004::EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS OF MINIMUM AND SUBMINIMUM WAGES - PANEL DATA ON STATE MINIMUM-WAGE LAWS+NEUMARK, D; WASCHER, W+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+OCT 1992::THE IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE U.K. MINIMUM WAGE ON THE EMPLOYMENT PROBABILITIES OF LOW-WAGE WORKERS+Stewart, Mark B.+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION+MAR 2004::The employment effects of the national minimum wage+Stewart, MB+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAR 2004::Estimating the impact of the minimum wage using geographical wage variation+Stewart, MB+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+2002::no title+SWAFFIELD J+ESTIMATING IMPACT 7+2008::no title+TUELINGS C+INT ECON REV+2000::no title+Wooldridge, J.+Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data+2002::no title+WOOLDRIDGE J+NBER SUMM 2007 UNPUB+2007"

In this article we examine the ability of several versions of the RESET test to detect such misspecifications in an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study. We find that: (i) the best variants of the RESET test are clearly those based on one or two fitted powers of the response index; and (ii) the loss of power resulting from using the RESET instead of a test directed against a specific type of misspecification is very small in many cases.","C12,C15,C25","SPECIFICATION ERROR,NUISANCE PARAMETER,OMITTED VARIABLES,DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS,PROBIT MODELS,HYPOTHESES,POWER","Ramalho, Esmeralda A.@Univ Evora, Dept Econ, Evora, Portugal::Ramalho, Joaquim J.

A Welfare-Based Approach to Aggregating Growth Rates across Countries,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2011.00637.x,FEB 2012,2,2,"Aggregating per capita gross domestic product growth across countries has always been a technical problem because of the complexities in the relative movements of exchange rates, economic output and populations. As such, the conventional approach to aggregating growth across countries suffers from sensitivity to exchange rates, as well as from the possibility of aggregate growth rates not being convex combinations of individual growth rates. This article introduces a new methodology in aggregating per capita growth rates that does not suffer from the drawbacks of the conventional approach. Using a welfare-based approach, it is shown that the proposed methodology is robust w.r.t. exchange rates and generates weights that always add up to unity, thus avoiding the anomalies that are inherent in the conventional approach. The methodology proposed in the article is applied to calculate aggregate growth rates of 33 developing member countries as well as five regional groupings, and the results are compared with those arising from the conventional approach. A number of insights arise that were previously hidden or inaccessible.","E1,O1,O4,I3",,"Son, Hyun Hwa@Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines","Son, Hyun Hwa@Asian Development Bank",not exist,"MEASUREMENT OF INEQUALITY+ATKINSON, AB+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY+1970::no title+KAKWANI N+STATISTICS+1997"

We investigate the role of business environment in explaining China's productivity advantage using recent firm-level survey data. We find that China has better infrastructure, more skilled workers and more labour-hiring flexibility than India, but worse access to finance and a higher regulatory burden. Infrastructure appears to be a key constraint for India: it lags significantly behind China, yet it has important indirect effects for the effectiveness of labour flexibility. Labour flexibility also appears to be a major constraint for India, as evident in the predominance of small firms, the importance of firm size in accounting for India's disadvantage in productivity and the complementarity of proxies of labour flexibility with infrastructure and access to finance.

This corporatization policy has been used to restructure state-owned enterprises as well as govern a growing and diverse set of firms in a marketizing economy. The intent of these reforms is that, as has been found in other economies, incorporation should improve firm performance through granting previously state-owned and private firms the various legal forms that provide better protection of property rights and limited liability protection, among others. The findings are that incorporation improves firm performance separately from privatization and listing on stock markets. Even with an under-developed legal system and imperfect capital markets, incorporation generates a productivity improvement which bodes well for the emerging corporate sector in China.",,"CORPORATE VALUE,OWNERSHIP,CHINA,PRIVATIZATION,ENTERPRISES,MANAGEMENT,COUNTRIES","Li, Xiao Mei@Univ Oxford, China Growth Ctr, Oxford OX1 4AR, England::Yueh, Linda@Univ Oxford, China Growth Ctr, Oxford OX1 4AR, England","Li, Xiao Mei@University of Oxford::Yueh, Linda@University of Oxford",not exist,"no title+Adam, Christopher; Cavendish, William; Mistry, Percy S.+Adjusting Privatization: Case Studies from Developing Countries+1992::Can corporatization improve the performance of state-owned enterprises even without privatization?+Aivazian, VA; Ge, Y; Qiu, HP+JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE+OCT 2005::Law, finance, and economic growth in China+Allen, F; Qian, J; Qian, MJ+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JUL 2005::no title+BISHOP M+PRIVATIZATION GLOBAL+1993::Measuring and explaining management practices across firms and countries+Bloom, Nicholas; Van Reenen, John+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2007::Ownership structure and corporate performance+Demsetz, H; Villalonga, B+JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE+SEP 2001::no title+DJANKOV S+DETERMINANTS ENTERPR+2000::Privatization and firm performance: A comparison between rural and urban enterprises in China+Dong, Xiao-yuan; Putterman, Louis; Unel, Bulent+JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS+SEP 2006::Has a private sector emerged in China's industry?

An application of this model to a panel dataset of China at the provincial level over 1980-2005 shows significantly positive impact of FDI externalities on TFP within and across regions.

Does Financial Repression Inhibit or Facilitate Economic Growth? A Case Study of Chinese Reform Experience,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2011.00677.x,DEC 2011,60,26,"This article examines the impact of financial repression on economic growth during China's reform period. The aggregate financial repression index suggests that China's financial liberalization has been steady but gradual. Empirical estimation confirms that, on average, repressive policies helped economic growth, thanks probably to the prudent liberalization approach. But the impact turned from positive in the 1980s and the 1990s to negative in the 2000s, suggesting rising efficiency losses in recent years. Specifically, we find that lending to the state sector, interest rate regulation and capital account control were the main factors constraining China's economic growth in recent years.",,"TIME-SERIES,PANEL-DATA,LIBERALIZATION,TESTS,INTERMEDIATION,MARKETS,BANKING,MODELS","Huang, Yiping@Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China::Wang, Xun@Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Huang, Yiping@Peking University::Wang, Xun@Peking University",not exist,"The rise of Europe: Atlantic trade, institutional change, and economic growth+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S; Robinson, J+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2005::no title+Agarwala, Ramgopal.+Price Distortions and Growth in Developing Countries+1983::Financial liberalization, financial sector development and growth: Evidence from Malaysia+Ang, James B.; McKibbin, Warwick J.+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+SEP 2007::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::Financial liberalization: the experience of developing countries+Arestis, P.; Demetriades, P.+Eastern Economic Journal+1999::Financial development and economic growth: Assessing the evidence+Arestis, P; Demetriades, P+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAY 1997::EXPORTS AND ECONOMIC-GROWTH - FURTHER EVIDENCE+BALASSA, B+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+1978::Government spending in a simple model of endogenous growth+Barro, R.

The Cursed Virtue: Government Infrastructural Investment and Household Consumption in Chinese Provinces,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2011.00678.x,DEC 2011,33,5,"Using Chinese provincial panel data for the period 1978-2006, this article studies the relationship between government infrastructural investment and household consumption. In our baseline reduced-form regression, we find that a 1% point increase of infrastructural investment in the government budget leads to a 0.31% point reduction of the share of household consumption in GDP. This result holds qualitatively in a variety of specifications and using different estimation methods. In contrast, private investment is not found to have any significant impact on the share of household consumption. Our structural estimations establish two channels for government investment's negative effects, one by encouraging the development of the secondary sector that is more capital-intensive than agriculture and services, and the other by increasing the profit rate in the industrial sector.",,"ECONOMIC-GROWTH,PANEL-DATA,FEDERALISM","Chen, Binkai@Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China::Yao, Yang@Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing, Peoples R China@Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chen, Binkai@Central University of Finance & Economics::Yao, Yang@Peking University",not exist,"SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::IS PUBLIC-EXPENDITURE PRODUCTIVE+ASCHAUER, DA+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAR 1989::Explaining China's low consumption: The neglected role of household income+Aziz, J.; Cui, L.+IMF Working Paper No.07/181+July 2007::Factor allocation in national income: a story beyond statistics+Bai, C; Qian, Z.+Econ Res+2009::Who Crowds out Residents' Income-An Analysis of China's National Income Distribution+Bai, C.; Qian, Z.+Social Sciences in China+2009::no title+BAI CE+EC RES J+2008::Rebalancing Growth in China: A Three-Handed Approach+Blanchard, Olivier; Giavazzi, Francesco.+Working Paper 05-32+2005::no title+Calderon, C.; Serven, L.+The Effects of Infrastructure Development on Growth and Income Distribution+2004::Why Are Saving Rates of Urban Households in China Rising?+Chamon, Marcos D.; Prasad, Eswar S.+AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-MACROECONOMICS+JAN 2010::Infrastructure development and economic growth: An explanation for regional disparities in China?+Demurger, S+JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS+MAR 2001::Institutions, infrastructure, and economic growth+Esfahani, HS; Ramirez, MT+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+APR 2003::Roads to prosperity?

We show that if time series follow non-causal autoregressive processes, their lags are not valid instruments, and the GMM estimator is inconsistent. Moreover, endogeneity of the instruments may not be revealed by the J -test of over-identifying restrictions that may be inconsistent and has, in general, low finite-sample power.

Contrary to conventional retail prices, we find that Internet prices change less often in the US than in EU countries. However, this does not hold for all product categories. Second, prices on the Internet are not necessarily more flexible than prices in brick-andmortar stores. Third, our dataset reveals substantial heterogeneity in the frequency of price changes across Internet shops. Finally, panel logit estimates suggest that the likelihood of observing a price change is a function of both state-dependent and time-dependent factors.",,FACTS,"Luennemann, Patrick@Banque Cent Luxembourg, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg::Wintr, Ladislav@Banque Cent Luxembourg, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg","Luennemann, Patrick@Unknow::Wintr, Ladislav@Unknow",not exist,"Do decreasing hazard functions make sense?+Alvarez, L; Burriel, P; Hernando, I.+ECB Working Paper No. 461+2005::no title+ALVAREZ LJ+J EUROPEAN EC ASS+2005::Price-setting Behaviour in Spain: Evidence from Micro PPI Data+Alvarez, Luis J.; Burriel, Pablo; Hernando, Ignacio+MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS+MAR-APR 2010::Time-dependent versus state-dependent pricing: a panel data approach to the determinants of Belgian consumer price changes+Aucremanne, L; Dhyne, E.+ECB Working Paper No. 462+2005::What do thirteen million price records have to say about consumer price rigidity?+Baudry, Laurent; Le Bihan, Herve; Sevestre, Patrick; et al.+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+APR 2007::no title+BERGEN M+P 38 HAW INT C SYST+2005::Some evidence on the importance of sticky prices+Bils, M; Klenow, PJ+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 2004::Large devaluations and the real exchange rate+Burstein, A; Eichenbaum, M; Rebelo, S+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+AUG 2005::no title+Campbell, J.R.; Eden, B.+Rigid prices: evidence from US scanner data+2005::THE FREQUENCY OF PRICE ADJUSTMENT - A STUDY OF THE NEWSSTAND PRICES OF MAGAZINES+CECCHETTI, SG+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1986::Nominal rigidities without literal menu costs: evidence from E-commerce+Chakrabarti, R; Scholnick, B+ECONOMICS LETTERS+FEB 2005::Price changes in the Euro area and the United States: Some facts from individual consumer price data+Dhyne, E; Alvarez, LJ; Le Bihan, H; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+SPR 2006::Lessons about markets from the Internet+Ellison, G; Ellison, SF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+SPR 2005::What firms' surveys tell us about pricesetting behavior in the euro area+Fabiani, S.; Druant, M.; Hernando, I.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Kwapil, C.; Landau, B.; Loupias, C.; Martins, F</span>.+Int.

Robust Non-nested Testing for Ordinary Least Squares Regression when Some of the Regressors are Lagged Dependent Variables,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00630.x,OCT 2011,41,3,The problem of testing non-nested regression models that include lagged values of the dependent variable as regressors is discussed. It is argued that it is essential to test for error autocorrelation if ordinary least squares and the associated J and F tests are to be used. A heteroskedasticity-robust joint test against a combination of the artificial alternatives used for autocorrelation and non-nested hypothesis tests is proposed. Monte Carlo results indicate that implementing this joint test using a wild bootstrap method leads to a well-behaved procedure and gives better control of finite sample significance levels than asymptotic critical values.,,"COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATOR,WILD BOOTSTRAP,ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES,MODEL-SPECIFICATION,STANDARD ERRORS,LINEAR-MODELS,UNKNOWN FORM,MONTE-CARLO,HETEROSKEDASTICITY,AUTOCORRELATION","Godfrey, Leslie G.@Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Godfrey, Leslie G.@University of York - UK",not exist,"HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::EDGEWORTH CORRECTION BY BOOTSTRAP IN AUTOREGRESSIONS+BOSE, A+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1988::TESTING FOR AUTOCORRELATION IN DYNAMIC LINEAR-MODELS+BREUSCH, TS+AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS+1978::Robust nonnested testing and the demand for money+Choi, Hwan-Sik; Kiefer, Nicholas M.+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2008::Asymptotic inference under heteroskedasticity of unknown form+Cribari-Neto, F+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 1 2004::Implementing the wild bootstrap using a two-point distribution+Davidson, James; Monticini, Andrea; Peel, David+ECONOMICS LETTERS+SEP 2007::Heteroskedasticity-Robust Tests in Regression Directions+Davidson, R.; MacKinnon, J.+Ann.

Testing Stationarity in Small- and Medium-Sized Samples when Disturbances are Serially Correlated,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00620.x,OCT 2011,25,2,"In this article, we study the size distortions of the KPSS test for stationarity when serial correlation is present and samples are small- and medium-sized. It is argued that two distinct sources of the size distortions can be identified. The first source is the finite-sample distribution of the long-run variance estimator used in the KPSS test, while the second source of the size distortions is the serial correlation not captured by the long-run variance estimator because of a too narrow choice of truncation lag parameter. When the relative importance of the two sources is studied, it is found that the size of the KPSS test can be reasonably well controlled if the finite-sample distribution of the KPSS test statistic, conditional on the time-series dimension and the truncation lag parameter, is used. Hence, finite-sample critical values, which can be applied to reduce the size distortions of the KPSS test, are supplied. When the power of the test is studied, it is found that the price paid for the increased size control is a lower raw power against a non-stationary alternative hypothesis.",,"UNIT-ROOT,TIME-SERIES,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,NULL HYPOTHESIS,COINTEGRATION,ORDER,POWER","Jonsson, Kristian@Sveriges Riksbank, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden","Jonsson, Kristian@Unknow",not exist,"Size distortions of tests of the null hypothesis of stationarity: evidence and implications for the PPP debate+Caner, M; Kilian, L+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+OCT 2001::A guide to the computation of stationarity tests+Carrion-I-Silvestre, JL; Sanso, A+EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS+JUN 2006::HOW SENSITIVE ARE TRENDS TO DATA DEFINITIONS - RESULTS FOR EAST-ASIAN AND G5 COUNTRIES+CHEUNG, YW; CHINN, MD; TRAN, T+APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS+JAN 1995::LAG ORDER AND CRITICAL-VALUES OF THE AUGMENTED DICKEY-FULLER TEST+CHEUNG, YW; LAI, KS+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1995::MORE EFFICIENT ESTIMATION IN THE PRESENCE OF HETEROSCEDASTICITY OF UNKNOWN FORM+CRAGG, JG+ECONOMETRICA+1983::DISTRIBUTION OF THE ESTIMATORS FOR AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES WITH A UNIT ROOT+DICKEY, DA; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::COINTEGRATION AND ERROR CORRECTION - REPRESENTATION, ESTIMATION, AND TESTING+ENGLE, RF; GRANGER, CWJ+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1987::STOCHASTIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE LIFE CYCLE PERMANENT INCOME HYPOTHESIS - THEORY AND EVIDENCE+HALL, RE+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1978::Generalizations of the KPSS-test for stationarity+Hobijn, B; Franses, PH; Ooms, M+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+NOV 2004::The finite sample distribution of the KPSS test+Hornok, A; Larsson, R.+Econom J+2000::Testing Stationarity in Small and Medium-Sized Samples when Disturbances are Serially Correlated+Jonsson, K.+Working Paper 2006:20+2009::Finite-sample stability of the KPSS Test+Jonsson, K.+Working Paper 2006:23+2006::TESTING THE NULL HYPOTHESIS OF STATIONARITY AGAINST THE ALTERNATIVE OF A UNIT-ROOT - HOW SURE ARE WE THAT ECONOMIC TIME-SERIES HAVE A UNIT-ROOT+KWIATKOWSKI, D; PHILLIPS, PCB; SCHMIDT, P; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT-DEC 1992::On the power of stationarity tests using optimal bandwidth estimates+Lee, J+ECONOMICS LETTERS+MAY 1996::A CONSISTENT TEST FOR A UNIT-ROOT+LEYBOURNE, SJ; MCCABE, BPM+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1994::APPROXIMATE ASYMPTOTIC-DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS FOR UNIT-ROOT AND COINTEGRATION TESTS+MACKINNON, JG+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1994::Size and power of tests of stationarity in highly autocorrelated time series+Muller, UK+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 2005::A SIMPLE, POSITIVE SEMIDEFINITE, HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX+NEWEY, WK; WEST, KD+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1987::AUTOMATIC LAG SELECTION IN COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+NEWEY, WK; WEST, KD+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+OCT 1994::ASYMPTOTICS FOR LINEAR-PROCESSES+PHILLIPS, PCB; SOLO, V+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1992::TESTING FOR A UNIT-ROOT IN TIME-SERIES REGRESSION+PHILLIPS, PCB; PERRON, P+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1988::TESTING FOR UNIT ROOTS IN AUTOREGRESSIVE-MOVING AVERAGE MODELS OF UNKNOWN ORDER+SAID, SE; DICKEY, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1984::TESTS FOR UNIT ROOTS - A MONTE-CARLO INVESTIGATION+SCHWERT, GW+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1989::RESPONSE-SURFACE ESTIMATES OF THE KPSS STATIONARITY TEST+SEPHTON, PS+ECONOMICS LETTERS+MAR 1995::Prewhitening bias in HAC estimation+Sul, D; Phillips, PCB; Choi, CY+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 2005"

Although both the t-and F-type tests suffer from scale and shift effects compared with the presumed null distributions when a fixed order of autoregressive augmentation is applied, these effects disappear when the order of augmentation is sufficiently large. However, as found by Burridge and Taylor (2001) for the autoregressive case, individual t-ratio tests at the semi-annual frequency are not pivotal even with high orders of augmentation, although the corresponding joint F-type statistic is pivotal.

This article introduces a statistical test which shows that these findings are partially driven by stochastic changes in transitory income. Estimates of total economic mobility are inversely correlated with the panel spell length. For short data spells, estimated total economic mobility is significantly greater than the underlying structural economic mobility because of short-lived movements across the poverty line that cancel out over periods of multiple years.",,"POVERTY DYNAMICS,PERSISTENT,COUNTRIES","Naschold, Felix@Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA::Barrett, Christopher B.@Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Naschold, Felix@University of Wyoming::Barrett, Christopher B.@Cornell University","Barrett, Christopher@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9139-2721","Estimating measurement error in SIPP annual job earnings: A comparison of census survey and SSA administrative data+Abowd, J.

The special focus is on the parametric and non-parametric tests in Inclan and Tiao (1994) and Kokoszka and Leipus (2000). Whereas the asymptotic distribution of the former can be largely affected, the distribution of the latter remains invariant and renders consistent break-point estimates.

Do Spillovers Stimulate Incremental or Drastic Product Innovations? Evidence from German Establishment Data,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00618.x,AUG 2011,55,15,"Despite the generally recognized importance of knowledge spillovers, the empirical literature is essentially silent on the type of innovation stimulated by spillovers. We estimate the determinants of product innovations differing in their degree of newness to the adopting firm. Knowledge spillovers from rivals have a positive impact on incremental innovations. This impact is largely independent of participation in R&D cooperation. Spillovers exert no such independent influence on drastic innovation activities. The results support the hypothesis that establishments face difficulties in using knowledge that comes from areas they are not familiar with. Establishments exploit spillovers for incremental innovations rather than for drastic innovations. To some degree R&D cooperation can help to overcome the difficulties in using spillovers for drastic innovations. Furthermore, our estimates provide evidence that the firm's own R&D effort and the use of outside information are substitutes.",,"RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT,RESEARCH JOINT VENTURES,ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY,FRONTIER TECHNOLOGY,PANEL-DATA,PROFITABILITY,PERFORMANCE,ECONOMICS,MODELS,FIRMS","Jirjahn, Uwe@Univ Trier, Fachbereich 4, Lehrstuhl Arbeitsmarktokon, D-54286 Trier, Germany::Kraft, Kornelius@Tech Univ Dortmund, Lehrstuhl Wirtschaftspolit, Dortmund, Germany","Jirjahn, Uwe@Universitat Trier::Kraft, Kornelius@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"Interaction terms in logit and probit models+Ai, CR; Norton, EC+ECONOMICS LETTERS+JUL 2003::Works councils and environmental investment: Theory and evidence from German panel data+Askildsen, JE; Jirjahn, U; Smith, SC+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR &amp; ORGANIZATION+JUL 2006::no title+BELFIELD C+PRODUCT MARKET STRUC+2006::Competitive pressure: the effects on investments in product and process innovation+Boone, J+RAND JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FAL 2000::SMOOTH UNBIASED MULTIVARIATE PROBABILITY SIMULATORS FOR MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION OF LIMITED DEPENDENT VARIABLE MODELS+BORSCHSUPAN, A; HAJIVASSILIOU, VA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+AUG 1993::HEALTH, CHILDREN, AND ELDERLY LIVING ARRANGEMENTS - A MULTIPERIOD-MULTINOMIAL PROBIT MODEL WITH UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY AND AUTOCORRELATED ERRORS+BORSCHSUPAN, A; HAJIVASSILIOU, V; KOTLIKOFF, LJ; et al.+TOPICS IN THE ECONOMICS OF AGING+1992::no title+BRAND R+2 U HANN I QUANT EC+1996::Japanese research consortia: A microeconometric analysis of industrial policy+Branstetter, L; Sakakibara, M+JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS+JUN 1998::Measuring the unmeasurable: A country's non-R&amp;D expenditure on product and service innovation+Brouwer, E; Kleinknecht, A+RESEARCH POLICY+JAN 1997::Research joint ventures+Caloghirou, Y; Ioannides, S; Vonortas, NS+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS+SEP 2003::Multivariate probit regression using simulated maximum likelihood+Capellari, L.; Jenkins, S.

Because ICT adoption is incomplete, especially in developing countries, different groups of firms will have different production technologies. We estimate a latent class stochastic frontier model, which allows us to test for the existence of multiple production technologies across firms and consider the associated implications for efficiency measures. We use a unique data set of Chilean retailers, which includes detailed information on ICT adoption. We find three distinct production technologies.

Why Are Concavity Conditions Not Satisfied in the Cost Function? The Case of Japanese Manufacturing Firms during the Bubble Period,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00623.x,AUG 2011,20,2,"This paper examines empirically the reasons why Japanese manufacturing firms frequently fail to satisfy concavity of the cost function in input prices. We focus on the 'bubble period' in the 1980s when land was in great demand and land prices soared. By estimating the translog cost function with land as one of production inputs, we find that violation of concavity mainly resulted from weak bank-firm relationship and massive transactions of land. We also demonstrate that elasticities of substitution between land and other inputs are estimated quite differently if the firms violating concavity are not excluded from the analysis.",,"UNITED-STATES-AIRLINES,BORROWING CONSTRAINTS,CORPORATE-INVESTMENT,TECHNICAL PROGRESS,PANEL-DATA,DEMAND,TRANSLOG,FORMS","Ogawa, Kazuo@Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka 5670047, Japan","Ogawa, Kazuo@Osaka University",not exist,"CONJUGATE DUALITY AND TRANSCENDENTAL LOGARITHMIC FUNCTION+CHRISTENSEN, LR; LAU, LJ; JORGENSON, DW+ECONOMETRICA+1971::TRANSCENDENTAL LOGARITHMIC PRODUCTION FRONTIERS+CHRISTENSEN, LR; JORGENSON, DW; LAU, LJ+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+1973::Airline code-share alliances and costs: Imposing concavity on translog cost function estimation+Chua, CL; Kew, H; Yong, JS+REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION+JUN 2005::FLEXIBLE FUNCTIONAL FORMS AND GLOBAL CURVATURE CONDITIONS+DIEWERT, WE; WALES, TJ+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1987::no title+HARDLE W+ECONOMET THEOR+1992::EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE ON THE LAW OF DEMAND+HARDLE, W; HILDENBRAND, W; JERISON, M+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1991::THE RELATION BETWEEN FIRM GROWTH AND Q WITH MULTIPLE CAPITAL GOODS - THEORY AND EVIDENCE FROM PANEL DATA ON JAPANESE FIRMS+HAYASHI, F; INOUE, T+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::EVIDENCE ON Q AND INVESTMENT FOR JAPANESE FIRMS+HOSHI, T; KASHYAP, AK+JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES+DEC 1990::Econometric methods for modeling producer behavior+Jorgenson, D.

Testing Steady-State Restrictions of Linear Rational Expectations Models when Data are Highly Persistent,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00629.x,JUN 2011,51,4,"Steady-state restrictions are commonly imposed on highly persistent variables to achieve stationarity prior to confronting rational expectations models with data. However, the resulting steady-state deviations are often surprisingly persistent indicating that some aspects of the underlying theory may be empirically problematic. This paper discusses how to formulate steady-state restrictions in rational expectations models with latent forcing variables and test their validity using cointegration techniques. The approach is illustrated by testing steady-state restrictions for alternative specifications of the New Keynesian model and shown to be able to discriminate between different assumptions on the sources of the permanent shocks.","C32,C52,E12","VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS,KEYNESIAN PHILLIPS-CURVE,ADJUSTMENT COST MODEL,BUSINESS-CYCLE,AGGREGATE FLUCTUATIONS,ECONOMIC-FLUCTUATIONS,INFLATION DYNAMICS,TECHNOLOGY SHOCKS,STOCHASTIC TRENDS,MONETARY-POLICY","Juselius, Mikael@Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Juselius, Mikael@University of Helsinki",not exist,"TIME-TO-BUILD AND AGGREGATE FLUCTUATIONS - SOME NEW EVIDENCE+ALTUG, S+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 1989::Econometric evaluation of the New Keynesian Phillips curve+Bardsen, G; Jansen, ES; Nymoen, R+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+SEP 2004::Euro area inflation persistence+Batini, Nicoletta+EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS+DEC 2006::no title+BINDER M+HDB APPL ECONOMETRIC+1995::THE SOLUTION OF LINEAR DIFFERENCE MODELS UNDER RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS+BLANCHARD, OJ; KAHN, CM+ECONOMETRICA+1980::no title+BROZE L+REDUCED FORMS RATION+1990::COINTEGRATION AND TESTS OF PRESENT VALUE MODELS+CAMPBELL, JY; SHILLER, RJ+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 1987::no title+CANOVA F+NONSTATIONARY TIME S+1994::Non-stationary hours in a DSGE model+Chang, Yongsung; Doh, Taeyoung; Schorfheide, Frank+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+SEP 2007::Business cycle accounting+Chari, V.

In particular, we employ synthetic control methods in a panel of transition economies and compare GDP growth in treated (that is, open) countries with growth in a convex combination of similar but untreated (that is, closed) countries. We find that trade liberalization tends to have a positive effect on the pattern of real GDP per capita. One of our most robust results shows that making the transition without opening up to trade considerably hampers growth.","C21,C23,F43,O57,P2","DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES,LIBERALIZATION,PRODUCTIVITY,PERFORMANCE,PATTERNS,POLICIES,MARKET,PLAN","Nannicini, Tommaso@Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, I-20136 Milan, Italy::Billmeier, Andreas@Ziff Bros Investments, New York, NY USA","Nannicini, Tommaso@Bocconi University::Billmeier, Andreas@Unknow",not exist,"The economic costs of conflict: A case study of the Basque Country+Abadie, A; Gardeazabal, J+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 2003::Synthetic Control Methods for Comparative Case Studies: Estimating the Effect of California's Tobacco Control Program+Abadie, Alberto; Diamond, Alexis; Hainmueller, Jens+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2010::Trade and productivity+Alcala, F; Ciccone, A+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 2004::Inflation Targeting in Georgia: Are We There Yet+Bakradze, G.; Billmeier, A.+IMF Working Paper 07/193+2007::Growth in transition economies: A trade policy perspective+Barlow, D+ECONOMICS OF TRANSITION+2006::ECONOMIC-GROWTH IN A CROSS-SECTION OF COUNTRIES+BARRO, RJ+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1991::Institution building and growth in transition economies+Beck, Thorsten; Laeven, Luc+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH+JUN 2006::Does financial liberalization spur growth?+Bekaert, G; Harvey, CR; Lundblad, C+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JUL 2005::The evolution of output in transition economies: Explaining the deference+Berg, A.; Borensztein, E.; Sahay, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Zettelmeyer, J</span>.+IMF Working Paper 99/73+1999::Trade and poverty in the poor countries+Bhagwati, J; Srinivasan, TN+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2002::Outward-orientation and development: are the revisionists right?+Bhagwati, J.; Srinivasan, T.

In this article, we focus on the acceleration cycle in the euro area, namely the peaks and troughs of the growth rate which delimit the slowdown and acceleration phases of the economy. Our aim is twofold: first, we put forward a reference turning point chronology of this cycle on a monthly basis, based on gross domestic product and industrial production indices. We consider both euro area aggregate level and country-specific cycles for the six main countries of the zone. Second, we come up with a new turning point indicator, based on business surveys carefully watched by central banks and short-term analysts, to follow in real-time the fluctuations of the acceleration cycle.","C22,C52,E32","BUSINESS-CYCLE DYNAMICS,TIME-SERIES,DURATION DEPENDENCE,LEADING INDICATORS,TURNING-POINTS,FACTOR MODEL,REGIME,SYNCHRONIZATION,PHASES","Darne, Olivier@Banque France, F-75049 Paris 01, France@Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Nantes, France::Ferrara, Laurent@Banque France, F-75049 Paris 01, France","Darne, Olivier@Universite de Nantes::Ferrara, Laurent@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Altissimo, F; Cristadoro, R; Forni, M<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lippi, M; Veronese, G</span>.+New Eurocoin: tracking economic growth in real time+2007::A turning point chronology for the Euro-zone classical and growth cycle+Anas, J.; Billio, M.; Ferrara, L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lo Duca, M</span>.+Growth and cycle in the Eurozone+2007::Detecting Cyclical Turning Points : The ABCD Approach and Two Probabilistic Indicators+ANAS, J; FERRARA, L.+Journal of Business Cycle Measurement and Analysis+2004::A system for dating and detecting turning points in the Euro area+Anas, Jacques; Billio, Monica; Ferrara, Laurent; et al.+MANCHESTER SCHOOL+2008::Dating business cycles: A methodological contribution with an application to the Euro area+Artis, M; Marcellino, M; Proietti, T+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+SEP 2004::The European business cycle+Artis, M; Krolzig, HM; Toro, J+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 2004::Business cycles for G7 and European countries+Artis, MJ; Kontolemis, ZG; Osborn, DR+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+APR 1997::The three Ps: simple tools for monitoring economic cycles+Banerji, A.+Business Economics+1999::A useful tool for forecasting the Euro-area business cycle phases+Bengoechea, Pilar; Camacho, Maximo; Perez-Quiros, Gabriel+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+2006::Models to date the business cycle: The Italian case+Bruno, Giancarlo; Otranto, Edoardo+ECONOMIC MODELLING+SEP 2008::no title+Bry, G; Boschan, C.+CYCLICAL ANAL TIME S+1971::no title+Burns, A.

The Role of Export Market Participation in the Choice of Organizational Form of Production Technology,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00628.x,JUN 2011,29,2,"This paper shows that the reason for a higher capital-labour ratio, observed for exporting firms, is a higher capital intensity of their production technology. Exporters choose to use different organizational forms of their production process, in which the share of capital and intermediate inputs in the final output is higher than that of non-exporters. The organization of the production process is part of the firm's organizational strategy, which generates within-industry heterogeneity in factor intensities and production technologies. The results of this study indicate that the decision to export is preceded by a process of restructuring production technology, which then has the effect of increasing a firms' productivity and in so doing prepares them for competition in the global market.","F14,O33,D21","INTERNATIONAL-TRADE,PERFORMANCE,DYNAMICS,INDUSTRY,PLANTS,FIRMS,SIZE","Stoyanov, Andrey@York Univ, Fac Liberal Arts & Profess Studies, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","Stoyanov, Andrey@York University - Canada",not exist,"Exporting and performance: evidence from Chilean plants+Alvarez, R; Lopez, RA+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE+NOV 2005::Innovation, Firm Dynamics, and International Trade+Atkeson, Andrew; Burstein, Ariel Tomas+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+JUN 2010::no title+AW BY+AM EC REV IN PRESS+2009::Export-market participation and productivity performance in Canadian manufacturing+Baldwin, JR; Gu, WL+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE+AUG 2003::Plants and productivity in international trade+Bernard, AB; Eaton, J; Jensen, JB; et al.+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 2003::Exceptional exporter performance: cause, effect, or both?+Bernard, AB; Jensen, JB+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+FEB 1999::Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models+Blundell, R; Bond, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1998::Trade liberalization, exports and technology upgrading: evidence on the impact of mercosur on argentinean firms+Bustos, P.+Am.

The evaluation makes use of a random assignment into a treatment group receiving personal budgets and a control group receiving either in-kind benefits (agency care) or cash payments. Compared with agency care, personal budgets extend the support by independent providers, but leave health outcomes unchanged. Compared with cash payments, personal budgets tend to improve health outcomes, but double LTCI spending due to a strong crowding out of informal care by formal care.","I38,I12,C93","LONG-TERM-CARE,HOME,PROGRAMS,EARNINGS,SERVICES","Arntz, Melanie@Univ Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany@Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany::Thomsen, Stephan L.@Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Dept Econ & Management, Magdebur, Germany@ZEW, Mannheim, Germany","Arntz, Melanie@Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW)@Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg::Thomsen, Stephan L.@Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW)","Thomsen, Stephan@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9677-9199","Semiparametric difference-in-differences estimators+Abadie, A+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JAN 2005::no title+ARNTZ M+J EC STAT IN PRESS+2010::USING THE LONGITUDINAL STRUCTURE OF EARNINGS TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF TRAINING-PROGRAMS+ASHENFELTER, O; CARD, D+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+1985::no title+Badelt, Christoph; Holzmann-Jenkins, Andrea; Matul, Christian<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Osterle, August</span>.+Analyse der Auswirkungen des Pflegevorsorgesystems+1997::Comparing consumer-directed and agency models for providing supportive services at home+Benjamin, AE; Matthias, R; Franke, TM+HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH+APR 2000::Effects of cash and counseling on personal care and well-being+Carlson, Barbara Lepidus; Foster, Leslie; Dale, Stacy B.; et al.+HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH+FEB 2007::THE EFFECT OF THE MEDICAID HOME CARE BENEFIT ON LONG-TERM-CARE CHOICES OF THE ELDERLY+ETTNER, SL+ECONOMIC INQUIRY+JAN 1994::Improving the quality of Medicaid personal assistance through consumer direction+Foster, L; Brown, R; Phillips, B.+Health Affairs+January-June 2003::no title+Frey, B.

Why has China Grown So Fast? The Role of Physical and Human Capital Formation,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00625.x,APR 2011,88,13,"Cross-province growth regressions for China are estimated for the reform period. Two research questions are asked. Can the regressions help us to understand why China as a whole has grown so fast? What types of investment matter for China's growth? We address the problem of model uncertainty by adopting two approaches to model selection to consider a wide range of candidate predictors of growth. Starting from the baseline equation, the growth impact of physical and human capital is examined using panel data techniques. Both forms of capital promote economic growth. 'Investment in innovation' and private investment are found to be particularly important. Secondary school enrolment contributes to growth, and higher education enrolment even more so.","O40,O53","PANEL-DATA MODELS,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,REGIONAL DISPARITY,GDP STATISTICS,REFORM PERIOD,REGRESSIONS,ACCUMULATION,INEQUALITY,IMPACT,DETERMINANTS","Ding, Sai@Univ Glasgow, Dept Econ, Glasgow G12 8RT, Lanark, Scotland::Knight, John@Univ Oxford, China Growth Ctr, Oxford OX1 4AR, England","Ding, Sai@University of Glasgow@University of Strathclyde::Knight, John@University of Oxford",not exist,"CATCHING UP, FORGING AHEAD, AND FALLING BEHIND+ABRAMOVITZ, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC HISTORY+JUN 1986::Law, finance, and economic growth in China+Allen, F; Qian, J; Qian, MJ+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JUL 2005::ANOTHER LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+ARELLANO, M; BOVER, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::Geographic factors and China's regional development under market reforms, 1978-1998+Bao, SM; Chang, GH; Sachs, JD; et al.+CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW+2002::ECONOMIC-GROWTH IN A CROSS-SECTION OF COUNTRIES+BARRO, RJ+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1991::no title+Barro, Robert J; Sala-i-Martin, Xavier.+Economic Growth+2004::THE ROLE OF HUMAN-CAPITAL IN ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT EVIDENCE FROM AGGREGAT CROSS-COUNTRY DATA+BENHABIB, J; SPIEGEL, MM+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+OCT 1994::China's Fiscal System: A Work in Progress+Bird, Richard M.; Wong, Christine P.

Moreover, the substantial discrepancies in activity at the sectoral level justify the interest in sectoral disaggregation. Compared with the confidence indicators produced by the European Commission we show that factor-based CCIs, using survey answers at a more disaggregate level, produce higher correlation with the reference series for the majority of sectors and countries.","E32,E37,C53","DYNAMIC-FACTOR MODEL,BUSINESS-CYCLE,AREA","Carriero, Andrea@Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Econ, London E1 4NS, England::Marcellino, Massimiliano@European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, I-50133 Florence, Italy","Carriero, Andrea@Queen Mary University London@University of London::Marcellino, Massimiliano@European University Institute","CARRIERO, ANDREA@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4409-2870","New Eurocoin. tracking economic growth in real time+Altissimo, F.; Cristadoro, R.; Forni, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lippi, M.; Veronese, G</span>.+CEPR Discussion Paper 5633+2006::EuroCOIN: A real time coincident indicator of the euro area business cycle+Altissimo,, F.; Bassanetti,, A.; Christadora,, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Forni,, M.; Hallin,, M.; Lippi,, M.; Reichlin,, L</span>.+CEPR Working Paper 3108+2001::Dating business cycles: A methodological contribution with an application to the Euro area+Artis, M; Marcellino, M; Proietti, T+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+SEP 2004::Are more data always better for factor analysis?+Boivin, J; Ng, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 2006::no title+Brillinger, D.

Understanding Italian Inequality Trends,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00606.x,APR 2011,33,2,"This article develops a unifying framework for analysing the effects of: (i) the changing distribution of individual incomes by main factor sources, (ii) the increasing participation of wives in the labour force, and (iii) the changing distribution of family types on the distinctive trends towards inequality in equivalent household income in Italy between 1977 and 2004.

His discussion covers such topics as the permanent-transitory innovation distinction inherent in difference and trend stationary processes, common factor restrictions and general-to-specific modelling.

Profit Shifting and Measured Productivity of Multinational Firms,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00610.x,FEB 2011,30,7,"This article examines the differences in total factor productivity (TFP) between multinationals and domestic firms before and after tax rate changes. The aim is to investigate whether the host country corporate tax rate has a significant influence on the measured TFP advantage of multinational companies. Using a sample of approximately 16,000 European manufacturing firms (1998-2004), we find that a cut by 10 percentage points in the statutory corporate tax rate would increase multinationals' measured TFP by about 10% relative to domestic firms, consistent with profit shifting by multinationals. At the sample mean, this would imply a 44% increase in the TFP advantage of multinationals.","D24,F23,H25",SCALE,"Maffini, Giorgia@Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 1HP, England::Mokkas, Socrates@Off Gas & Elect Markets OFGEM, London SW1P 3GE, England","Maffini, Giorgia@University of Oxford::Mokkas, Socrates@Unknow",not exist,"Do domestic firms benefit from direct foreign investment?

China's One-Child Policy and 'the Mystery of Missing Women': Ethnic Minorities and Male-Biased Sex Ratios,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00601.x,FEB 2011,46,16,"Recent estimates suggest that as many as 40 million women are 'missing' in China. We exploit a special provision in the Chinese one-child policy (OCP; allowing for preferential treatment of ethnic minority groups) to revisit the mystery of these missing women, and in particular to explore the contribution of China's OCP in distorting sex ratios. Our results imply that preference for boys is the main driver of the gender gap, and that the OCP is responsible for about half of it. This is true even before ultrasound technologies for prenatal gender determination were available. Not surprisingly, interaction between the OCP and ultrasound technologies has contributed to the gender gap.","J1,D13,I18","RURAL CHINA,GENDER BIAS,HEALTH-CARE,HEPATITIS-B,MORTALITY,NUMBER,BIRTH,FERTILITY,ACCOUNT,POVERTY","Bulte, Erwin@Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands@Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, Tilburg, Netherlands::Heerink, Nico@Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands@Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing, Peoples R China::Zhang, Xiaobo@IFPRI, Washington, DC USA","Bulte, Erwin@Wageningen University & Research@Tilburg University::Heerink, Nico@Wageningen University & Research@Nanjing Agricultural University::Zhang, Xiaobo@International Food Policy Research Institute","Heerink, Nico@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9911-3501","Sex preference in South Asia: Sri Lanka an outlier.+Abeykoon, A T+Asia-Pacific population journal+1995-Sep::ETHNIC-DIFFERENCES IN FERTILITY AND SEX-RATIOS AT BIRTH IN CHINA - EVIDENCE FROM XINJIANG+ANDERSON, BA; SILVER, BD+POPULATION STUDIES-A JOURNAL OF DEMOGRAPHY+JUL 1995::CHILD POVERTY, INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN AND GENERATIONAL MOBILITY: THE SHORT AND LONG TERM WELLBEING OF CHILDREN IN URBAN CHINA AFTER THE ONE CHILD POLICY+Anderson, Gordon; Leo, Teng Wah+REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH+JUL 2009::Transitional stages and identity boundaries: The case of ethnic minorities in China+Attane, I; Courbage, Y+POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT+JAN 2000::China's family planning policy: An overview of its past and future+Attane, I+STUDIES IN FAMILY PLANNING+MAR 2002::Shortage of girls in China today.+Banister, J.+Journal of Population Research+2004::Family planning in China: Out of control?+Bogg, L+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH+APR 1998::no title+CAI Y+CHINA REV+2003::no title+CHEN G+HEPATITIS B SEX RATI+2008::Prenatal sex determination and sex-selective abortion in rural central China+Chu, JH+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+JUN 2001::5 DECADES OF MISSING FEMALES IN CHINA+COALE, AJ; BANISTER, J+DEMOGRAPHY+AUG 1994::EXCESS FEMALE MORTALITY AND THE BALANCE OF THE SEXES IN THE POPULATION - AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF MISSING FEMALES+COALE, AJ+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+SEP 1991::Explaining Asia's,""missing women"": A new look at the data+Das Gupta, M+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+SEP 2005::Migration and rural poverty in China+Du, Y; Park, A; Wang, SG+JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS+DEC 2005::no title+EBENSTEIN A+SEX SELECTION FERTIL+2007::no title+EDLUND L+3214 IZA I LAB STUD+2007::Missing Women, the Marriage Market nomic Growth+Foster, Andrew D.; Rosenzweig, Mark R.+MISSING WOMEN MARRIA+2001::Gender gaps in access to health care in rural China+Gao, Mengtao; Yao, Yang+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+OCT 2006::Science, modernity, and the making of China's one-child policy+Greenhalgh, S+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+JUN 2003::Sex ratio at birth in China, with reference to other areas in East Asia: what we know.+Gu, B; Roy, K+Asia-Pacific population journal+1995-Sep::The ethnic minority-majority income gap in rural China during transition+Gustafsson, B; Shi, L+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+JUL 2003::The effect of China's one-child family policy after 25 years+Hesketh, T; Lu, L; Xing, ZW+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+SEP 15 2005::China migration country study+Huang, P.; Pieke, F.

Our results suggest that how the parent performs in reading and mathematics during their childhood is positively related to the corresponding test scores of their offspring as measured at a similar age.

Family Size and Educational Investments in Children: Evidence from Private Tutoring Expenditures in South Korea,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00607.x,FEB 2011,49,13,"Relying on private tutoring expenditures in South Korea, this paper examines whether large family size has a strong negative impact on educational investments in children. To deal with endogeneity of family size, the paper employs a non-parametric bounding method as well as an instrumental variables method. Our primary finding is that quantity-quality trade-offs in educational investments function in a way that varies by the sex of the child.

The Relative Importance of Symmetric and Asymmetric Shocks: The Case of United Kingdom and Euro Area,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00612.x,FEB 2011,18,7,"We show how a simple model with sign restrictions can be used to identify symmetric and asymmetric supply, demand and monetary policy shocks in an estimated two-country structural VAR for the UK and Euro area. The results can be used to deal with several issues that are relevant in the optimal currency area literature. We find an important role for symmetric shocks in explaining the variability of the business cycle in both economies. However, the relative importance of asymmetric shocks, being around 20% in the long run, cannot be ignored. Moreover, when we estimate the model for the UK and US, the degree of business cycle synchronization seems to be higher. Finally, we confirm existing evidence of the exchange rate being an independent source of shocks in the economy.","C32,E42,F31,F33","MONETARY-POLICY,EXCHANGE-RATE","Peersman, Gert@Univ Ghent, Dept Financial Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Peersman, Gert@Ghent University",not exist,"no title+ARTIS M+CEPR DISCUSSION PAPE+2000::Analysis of European and UK business cycles and shocks+Artis, M.J.+HM Treasury+2003::SHOCKING ASPECTS OF EUROPEAN MONETARY INTEGRATION+BAYOUMI, T; EICHENGREEN, B+ADJUSTMENT AND GROWTH IN THE EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION+1993::no title+BERGMAN M+392 UCSD DEP EC+1998::Optimal currency areas - Scottish Economic Society/Royal Bank of Scotland annual lecture, 1999+Buiter, WH+SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+AUG 2000::Real exchange rate fluctuations and the business cycle: Evidence from Japan+Chadha, B; Prasad, E+INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND STAFF PAPERS+SEP 1997::no title+CHAMIE N+BANK CANADA WORKING+1994::no title+ERKELROUSSE J+CEPR DISCUSSION PAPE+1995::Is the exchange rate a shock absorber or a source of shocks?

We use a panel data set of US foreign affiliate sales to 16 developed countries in seven industries over the period 1983-2000, distinguish between horizontal and vertical interdependence in multinational enterprise activity and allow for both market size (demand)-related as well as remainder linkage effects. Evidence suggests that vertical interdependence is somewhat more important than horizontal interdependence and, hence, vertical motives of multinational activity tend to dominate horizontal ones.",,"FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT,INTERNATIONAL-TRADE,MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION,INTRAINDUSTRY TRADE,INTEGRATION STRATEGIES,MODELS,CORPORATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,ECONOMIES,RETURNS","Badinger, Harald@Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria::Egger, Peter@ETH, KOF, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Badinger, Harald@Vienna University of Economics & Business::Egger, Peter@ETH Zurich",not exist,"The estimation of the variances in a variance components model+Amemiya, T.+International Econometric Review+1971::Gravity with gravitas: A solution to the border puzzle+Anderson, JE; van Wincoop, E+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 2003::no title+Anselin,, L.+Spatial econometrics: methods and models+1988::no title+BADINGER H+2556 CESIFO+2009::no title+Baltagi, B.+Econometric analysis of panel data+2008::Estimating models of complex FDI: Are there third-country effects?+Baltagi, Badi H.; Egger, Peter; Pfaffermayr, Michael+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 2007::no title+BARRIOS S+EXPLORING LINK UNPUB+2007::no title+BERGSTRAND JH+OUTSOURCIN INT UNPUB+2008::Multinational corporations and spillovers+Blomstrom, M; Kokko, A.+Journal of Economic Surveys+1998::FDI in space: Spatial autoregressive relationships in foreign direct investment+Blonigen, Bruce A.; Davies, Ronald B.; Waddell, Glen R.; et al.+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUL 2007::Estimating the knowledge-capital model of the multinational enterprise+Carr, DL; Markusen, JR; Maskus, KE+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2001::Technology, geography, and trade+Eaton, J; Kortum, S+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2002::no title+EGGER H+EXCHANGE RATE UNPUB+2007::Export-platform foreign direct investment+Ekholm, Karolina; Forslid, Rikard; Markusen, James R.+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION+JUN 2007::NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RETURNS TO SCALE IN THE MODERN THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL-TRADE+ETHIER, WJ+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1982::The impact of outsourcing and high-technology capital on wages: Estimates for the United States, 1979-1990+Feenstra, RC; Hanson, GH+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1999::Vertical intra-industry trade and foreign direct investment in East Asia+Fukao, K; Ishido, H; Ito, K+JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES+DEC 2003::no title+GREENAWAY D+ECONOMETRICS INTRAIN+1986::VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL INTRAINDUSTRY TRADE - A CROSS INDUSTRY ANALYSIS FOR THE UNITED-KINGDOM+GREENAWAY, D; HINE, R; MILNER, C+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+NOV 1995::COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS AND THE PATTERN OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL INTRAINDUSTRY TRADE IN THE UK+GREENAWAY, D; HINE, R; MILNER, C+WELTWIRTSCHAFTLICHES ARCHIV-REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS+1994::Optimal integration strategies for the multinational firm+Grossman, Gene M.; Helpman, Elhanan; Szeidl, Adam+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+SEP 2006::INTERNATIONAL-TRADE IN THE PRESENCE OF PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION - A CHAMBERLIN-HECKSCHER-OHLIN APPROACH+HELPMAN, E+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+1981::A SIMPLE THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL-TRADE WITH MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS+HELPMAN, E+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1984::no title+Helpman, E.; Krugman, P.R.+Market structure and foreign trade: Increasing returns, imperfect competition, and the international economy+1985::MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS AND TRADE STRUCTURE+HELPMAN, E+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+1985::no title+JABBOUR L+SLICING VALUE UNPUB+2008::Does foreign direct investment increase the productivity of domestic firms?

A Rational Expectations Consistent Measure of Risk: Using Financial Market Data from a Middle Income Context,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00598.x,DEC 2010,48,1,"Although economic theory assumes that risk is of central importance in financial decision making, it is difficult to measure the uncertainty faced by investors. Commonly used empirical proxies for risk (such as the moving standard deviation of the returns on an asset) are not firmly grounded in economic theory. Risk measures have been developed by other studies, but these are often based on subjective weights attaching to a range of objective component indicators, are difficult to replicate and are not strictly consistent with underlying theory. The contribution of this article is to develop a methodology to construct rational expectations consistent empirical risk measures. It has the advantages of being explicitly consistent with economic theory and easily replicable. We illustrate this methodology by specific application to the South African context. The time-varying risk measure developed in this article is consistent with a rational expectations application of the expectations hypothesis. The constructed measure is a broad one (it includes political risk and peso problems for instance) and reflects investors' perceptions of systematic risk.",,"AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES,TERM STRUCTURE ANOMALIES,RUN ECONOMIC-GROWTH,INTEREST-RATES,TRADITIONAL HYPOTHESES,COINTEGRATION ANALYSIS,VECM STRUCTURE,PESO-PROBLEM,UNIT-ROOT,MODELS","Fedderke, Johannes@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA@Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa@Econ Res So Africa, Cape Town, South Africa::Pillay, Neryvia@Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa","Fedderke, Johannes@University of Witwatersrand@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Pillay, Neryvia@University of Cape Town","Fedderke, Johannes@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4482-5939","Coherent measures of risk+Artzner, P; Delbaen, F; Eber, JM; et al.+MATHEMATICAL FINANCE+JUL 1999::no title+ARTZNER P+RISK+1997::On biases in tests of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates+Bekaert, G; Hodrick, RJ; Marshall, DA+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JUN 1997::Peso problem explanations for term structure anomalies+Bekaert, G; Hodrick, RJ; Marshall, DA+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+OCT 2001::A DEFENSE OF TRADITIONAL HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST-RATES+CAMPBELL, JY+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+MAR 1986::COINTEGRATION AND TESTS OF PRESENT VALUE MODELS+CAMPBELL, JY; SHILLER, RJ+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 1987::YIELD SPREADS AND INTEREST-RATE MOVEMENTS - A BIRDS-EYE-VIEW+CAMPBELL, JY; SHILLER, RJ+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+MAY 1991::no title+COX JC+J FINANC+1981::THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST-RATES+CULBERTSON, JM+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+1957::LIKELIHOOD RATIO STATISTICS FOR AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES WITH A UNIT-ROOT+DICKEY, DA; FULLER, WA+ECONOMETRICA+1981::DISTRIBUTION OF THE ESTIMATORS FOR AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES WITH A UNIT ROOT+DICKEY, DA; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::COINTEGRATION AND ERROR CORRECTION - REPRESENTATION, ESTIMATION, AND TESTING+ENGLE, RF; GRANGER, CWJ+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1987::Peso problems: their theoretical and empirical implications+Evans, M.

There are noticeable effects on exits from unemployment for entitlement lengths above 12 months.

We show that whilst demand appears to be inelastic in the short-run, the quantity traded on the market is significantly influenced by the price level and responds to previous disequilibria in the supply curve through an asymmetric error-correction mechanism, reacting to a positive disequilibrium but not to a negative one.",,"ERROR-CORRECTION MODELS,UNIT-ROOT TESTS,LONG-RUN,SPOT MARKET,SIMULTANEOUS-EQUATIONS,COINTEGRATION ANALYSIS,EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS,GASOLINE PRICES,CRUDE-OIL,POWER","Fezzi, Carlo@Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, CSERGE, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England::Bunn, Derek@London Business Sch, London NW1 4SA, England","Fezzi, Carlo@University of East Anglia::Bunn, Derek@London Business School@University of London","Bunn, Derek@P-5247-2016","COMMON STOCHASTIC TRENDS IN A SYSTEM OF EXCHANGE-RATES+BAILLIE, RT; BOLLERSLEV, T+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+MAR 1989::no title+BANERJEE A+ADV TEXT ECONOMETRIC+1993::Measuring market inefficiencies in California's restructured wholesale electricity market+Borenstein, S; Bushnell, JB; Wolak, FA+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2002::The long-run efficiency of real-time electricity pricing+Borenstein, S+ENERGY JOURNAL+2005::Market power in electricity markets: Beyond concentration measures+Borenstein, S; Bushnell, J; Knittel, CR+ENERGY JOURNAL+1999::The trouble with electricity markets: Understanding California's restructuring disaster+Borenstein, S+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+WIN 2002::An empirical analysis of the potential for market power in California's electricity industry+Borenstein, S; Bushnell, J+JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS+SEP 1999::Do gasoline prices respond asymmetrically to crude oil price changes?+Borenstein, S; Cameron, AC; Gilbert, R+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 1997::On the efficiency of competitive electricity markets with time-invariant retail prices+Borenstein, S; Holland, S+RAND JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FAL 2005::no title+BUNN DW+MODELLING PRICES COM+2003::Market structure and competition: A cross-market analysis of U.S. electricity deregulation+Bushnell, J.; Mansur, E.; Saravia, C.+CSEM Working Paper 126+2004::no title+CALLAWAY M+ESTIMATION IND BUYER+2005::ANN-based short-term load forecasting in electricity markets+Chen, H.; Canizares, C.

Bias Reduction in Dynamic Panel Data Models by Common Recursive Mean Adjustment,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00594.x,OCT 2010,30,13,"The within-group estimator (same as the least squares dummy variable estimator) of the dominant root in dynamic panel regression is known to be biased downwards. This article studies recursive mean adjustment (RMA) as a strategy to reduce this bias for AR(p) processes that may exhibit cross-sectional dependence. Asymptotic properties for N,T ->infinity jointly are developed. When ( log 2T)(N/T)->zeta, where zeta is a non-zero constant, the estimator exhibits nearly negligible inconsistency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the RMA estimator performs well in terms of reducing bias, variance and mean square error both when error terms are cross-sectionally independent and when they are not.

We use firm-level data from 1997 to 2008 for almost all sectors, including services, and show that firms in the service sector exhibit much higher rates of job creation, but almost exactly the same rates of job destruction as those in manufacturing. 'Small' firms account for a disproportionately large fraction of job creation and destruction relative to their share of employment.

Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the proposed tests are properly sized and equipped with enough power for sample sizes in excess of 1,000 observations. We apply the Wald tests to a comprehensive sample of Austrian firms. The estimation results indicate a substantial reduction in both the second and third central moments of log firm size over time for the younger age cohorts. For older ones, the log-normal distribution is a valid description of their size distribution.","C21,O47","INDUSTRY DYNAMICS,ASYMPTOTIC TESTS,GIBRATS-LAW,INVARIANCE,EVOLUTION,RESTRICTIONS,ORGANIZATION,NORMALITY,GROWTH,MODELS","Huber, Peter@Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria::Pfaffermayr, Michael@Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Huber, Peter@Unknow::Pfaffermayr, Michael@University of Innsbruck",not exist,"SPACE AND GROWTH: A SURVEY OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND METHODS+Abreu, Maria; de Groot, Henri L.

We find that almost 40% of the players have disadvantageous inequality aversion that is statistically different from zero and economically significant, but advantageous inequality aversion is relatively unimportant.

On the Choice of Control Variables in the Crime Equation,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00602.x,OCT 2010,60,10,"Although control variables are the reason for multiple regression, surprising little attention is given to the process of locating and selecting the controls. If important controls are omitted, estimates can be biased and inconsistent whereas using too many controls can reduce efficiency and mask effects. We advocate a much broader search for controls than is customary, at least in the crime literature, and then the use of the general-to-specific methodology to select the relevant controls. We illustrate this procedure using a fixed effects panel data design evaluating the effect of legalized abortion on crime.","K42,C5","LEGALIZED ABORTION,PRISON POPULATION,MEASUREMENT ERROR,ELECTORAL CYCLES,HOMICIDE RATES,UNIT-ROOT,IMPACT,REGRESSION,GUNS,DETERRENCE","Moody, Carlisle E.@Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA::Marvell, Thomas B.@Justec Res, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA","Moody, Carlisle E.@William & Mary::Marvell, Thomas B.@Unknow",not exist,"Measuring positive externalities from unobservable victim precaution: An empirical analysis of Lojack+Ayres, I; Levitt, SD+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 1998::Shooting down the ""more guns, less crime"" hypothesis+Ayres, I; Donohue, JJ+STANFORD LAW REVIEW+APR 2003::no title+BAUWENS L+EC WORKING PAPERS U+2008::How much should we trust differences-in-differences estimates?+Bertrand, M; Duflo, E; Mullainathan, S+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2004::Do right-to-carry laws deter violent crime?+Black, DA; Nagin, DS+JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES+JAN 1998::Explaining recent trends in US homicide rates+Blumstein, A; Rosenfeld, R+JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW &amp; CRIMINOLOGY+SUM 1998::TESTING FOR AUTOCORRELATION IN DYNAMIC LINEAR-MODELS+BREUSCH, TS+AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS+1978::SIMPLE TEST FOR HETEROSCEDASTICITY AND RANDOM COEFFICIENT VARIATION+BREUSCH, TS; PAGAN, AR+ECONOMETRICA+1979::Constructive data mining: Modeling consumers' expenditure in Venezuela+Campos, J.; Ericsson, N.

"Habits, Complementarities and Heterogeneity in Alcohol and Tobacco Demand: A Multivariate Dynamic Model*",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00590.x,AUG 2010,87,4,"In this paper we test the existence of forward-looking behaviour in a multivariate model for alcohol and tobacco consumption. The theoretical framework, based on a dynamic adjustment cost model with forward-looking behaviour, is enhanced to include the intertemporal interactions between the two goods. The analysis of the within-period preferences completes the intertemporal model, allowing to evaluate the static substitutability/complementarity relationships. The empirical strategy consists in a two-step estimation procedure. In a first stage, we obtain the parameters of the demand system, while in a second stage Euler equations are estimated. Results, based on a cohort data set constructed from a series of cross-sections of the Italian Household Budget Survey, reveal a significant complementarity relationship between alcohol and tobacco. Estimation of the Euler equations does not lead to rejection of the hypothesis of intertemporal dependence, providing evidence for a forward-looking behaviour in alcohol and tobacco consumption. Moreover, we find significant intertemporal interactions that support the adjustment cost setting in a multivariate model with rational expectations.",,"ADJUSTMENT COST MODELS,FORWARD-LOOKING BEHAVIOR,PANEL-DATA ANALYSIS,RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS,CIGARETTE ADDICTION,EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS,CROSS-SECTIONS,LIFE-CYCLE,INDIVIDUAL HETEROGENEITY,CONSUMER DEMAND","Aristei, David@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06123 Perugia, Italy::Pieroni, Luca@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, I-06123 Perugia, Italy","Aristei, David@University of Perugia::Pieroni, Luca@University of Perugia","Pieroni, Luca@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1841-4351::ARISTEI, DAVID@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6328-1407","TESTING THE RESPONSE OF CONSUMPTION TO INCOME CHANGES WITH (NOISY) PANEL DATA+ALTONJI, JG; SIOW, A+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1987::Poverty traps and nonlinear income dynamics with measurement error and individual heterogeneity+Antman, Francisca; McKenzie, David+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES+AUG 2007::Living rationally under the volcano?

Determinants and Dynamics of Current Account Reversals: An Empirical Analysis,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00588.x,AUG 2010,39,2,"We use panel probit models with unobserved heterogeneity, state dependence and serially correlated errors in order to analyse the determinants and the dynamics of current account reversals for a panel of developing and emerging countries. The likelihood-based inference of these models requires high-dimensional integration for which we use efficient importance sampling. Our results suggest that current account balance, terms of trades, foreign reserves and concessional debt are important determinants of current account reversal. Furthermore, we find strong evidence for serial dependence in the occurrence of reversals. While the likelihood criterion suggest that state dependence and serially correlated errors are essentially observationally equivalent, measures of predictive performance provide support for the hypothesis that the serial dependence is mainly due to serially correlated country-specific shocks related to local political or macroeconomic events.",,"PROBIT MODEL,UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY,PANEL-DATA,CONTAGION,CRISES,TRADE","Liesenfeld, Roman@Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Okonometrie, D-24098 Kiel, Germany::Moura, Guilherme Valle@Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ & OR, Amsterdam, Netherlands::Richard, Jean-Francois@Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ & OR, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Liesenfeld, Roman@University of Kiel::Moura, Guilherme Valle@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam::Richard, Jean-Francois@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","Moura, Guilherme@I-4142-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2351-1850","no title+Baltagi, Badi H.+Econometric Analysis of Panel Data+2005::A COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT QUADRATURE PROCEDURE FOR THE ONE-FACTOR MULTINOMIAL PROBIT MODEL+BUTLER, JS; MOFFITT, R+ECONOMETRICA+1982::no title+Calvo, G.

Factor MIDAS for Nowcasting and Forecasting with Ragged-Edge Data: A Model Comparison for German GDP*,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00591.x,AUG 2010,49,62,"In this article, we merge two strands from the recent econometric literature. First, factor models based on large sets of macroeconomic variables for forecasting, which have generally proven useful for forecasting. However, there is some disagreement in the literature as to the appropriate method. Second, forecast methods based on mixed-frequency data sampling (MIDAS). This regression technique can take into account unbalanced datasets that emerge from publication lags of high- and low-frequency indicators, a problem practitioner have to cope with in real time. In this article, we introduce Factor MIDAS, an approach for nowcasting and forecasting low-frequency variables like gross domestic product (GDP) exploiting information in a large set of higher-frequency indicators. We consider three alternative MIDAS approaches (basic, smoothed and unrestricted) that provide harmonized projection methods that allow for a comparison of the alternative factor estimation methods with respect to nowcasting and forecasting. Common to all the factor estimation methods employed here is that they can handle unbalanced datasets, as typically faced in real-time forecast applications owing to publication lags. In particular, we focus on variants of static and dynamic principal components as well as Kalman filter estimates in state-space factor models. As an empirical illustration of the technique, we use a large monthly dataset of the German economy to nowcast and forecast quarterly GDP growth. We find that the factor estimation methods do not differ substantially, whereas the most parsimonious MIDAS projection performs best overall. Finally, quarterly models are in general outperformed by the Factor MIDAS models, which confirms the usefulness of the mixed-frequency techniques that can exploit timely information from business cycle indicators.",,"DYNAMIC FACTOR MODELS,LEADING INDICATORS,PROFESSIONAL FORECASTERS,OUTPUT GROWTH,EURO-AREA,INFLATION,NUMBER,REGRESSIONS,SERIES,INDEX","Marcellino, Massimiliano@European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy@Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy::Schumacher, Christian@Deutsch Bundesbank, Econ Res Ctr, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany","Marcellino, Massimiliano@Bocconi University@European University Institute::Schumacher, Christian@Unknow",not exist,"no title+AASTVEIT KA+20079 NORG BANK+2007::New Eurocoin. tracking economic growth in real time+Altissimo, F.; Cristadoro, R.; Forni, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lippi, M.; Veronese, G</span>.+CEPR Discussion Paper 5633+2006::no title+ANDREOU E+J ECONOMETR IN PRESS+2010::Short-term forecasts of Euro area GDP growth+Angelini, E; Camba-Mendez, G; Gonzalo, C<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Giannone, D</span>.+ECB Working Paper No. 949+2008::Interpolation and backdating with a large information set+Angelini, Elena; Henry, Jerome; Marcellino, Massimillano+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+DEC 2006::Confidence intervals for diffusion index forecasts and inference for factor-augmented regressions+Bai, J; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2006::Determining the number of factors in approximate factor models+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::Determining the number of primitive shocks in factor models+Bai, Jushan; Ng, Serena+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2007::A look into the factor model black box: Publication lags and the role of hard and soft data in forecasting GDP+Banbura, M.; Runstler, G.+Working Paper No 751+2007::Are there any reliable leading indicators for US inflation and GDP growth?+Banerjee, A; Marcellino, M+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+JAN-MAR 2006::Leading indicators for Euro-area inflation and GDP growth+Banerjee, A; Marcellino, M; Masten, I+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+2005::Forecasting Macroeconomic Variables Using Diffusion Indexes in Short Samples with Structural Change+Banerjee, Anindya; Marcellino, Massimiliano; Masten, Igor+FORECASTING IN THE PRESENCE OF STRUCTURAL BREAKS AND MODEL UNCERTAINTY+2008::Short-term fo recasting of GDP using large monthly data sets.

Identifying Structural Breaks in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models*,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00586.x,AUG 2010,17,5,"This article suggests an alternative formulation of the cointegrated vector autoregressive (VAR) model such that the coefficients for the deterministic terms have straightforward interpretations. These coefficients can be interpreted as growth rates and cointegration mean level coefficients and express long-run properties of the model. For example, the growth rate coefficients tell us how much to expect (unconditionally) the variables in the system to grow from one period to the next, representing the underlying (steady state) growth in the variables. The estimation of the proposed formulation is made operationally in GRaM, which is a program for Ox Professional. GRaM can be used for analysing structural breaks when the deterministic terms include shift dummies and broken trends. By applying a formulation with interpretable deterministic components, different types of structural breaks can be identified. Shifts in both intercepts and growth rates, or combinations of these, can be tested for. The ability to distinguish between different types of structural breaks makes the procedure superior compared with alternative procedures. Furthermore, the procedure utilizes the information more efficiently than alternative procedures. Finally, interpretable coefficients of different types of structural breaks can be identified.",,"HYPOTHESIS,RANK","Hungnes, Havard@Stat Norway, Res Dept, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway","Hungnes, Havard@Statistics Norway",not exist,"Identifying, estimating and testing restricted cointegrated systems: An overview+Boswijk, HP+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+NOV 2004::no title+Clements, Michael.+Forecasting non-stationary economic time series.+1999::no title+Doornik, J.A.+Object-oriented Matrix Programming Using Ox 3.0+2001::Approximations to the asymptotic distribution of cointegration tests+Doornik, Jurgen A.+Journal of Economic Surveys+1998::TESTING FOR COMMON FEATURES+ENGLE, RF; KOZICKI, S+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 1993::Granger's representation theorem: A closed-form expression for I(1) processes+Hansen, PR+ECONOMETRICS JOURNAL+2005::Structural changes in the cointegrated vector autoregressive model+Hansen, PR+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2003::Co-breaking: Recent advances and a synopsis of the literature+Hendry, David F.; Massmann, Michael+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2007::no title+HENDRY DF+THEORY COBREAK UNPUB+1996::no title+HUNGNES H+309 STAT NORW+2002::no title+Hungnes, H.+Identifying the Deterministic Components in GRaM for Ox Professional: User Manual and Documentation+2005::ESTIMATION AND HYPOTHESIS-TESTING OF COINTEGRATION VECTORS IN GAUSSIAN VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS+JOHANSEN, S+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1991::Cointegration analysis in the presence of structural breaks in the deterministic trend+Johansen, S.; Mosconi, R.; Nielsen, B.+Econometrics Journal+2000::no title+Johansen, S.+Likelihood-Based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models.+1996::Testing for the cointegrating rank of a VAR process with level shift at unknown time+Lutkepohl, H; Saikkonen, P; Trenkler, C+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2004::THE GREAT CRASH, THE OIL PRICE SHOCK, AND THE UNIT-ROOT HYPOTHESIS+PERRON, P+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1989::Testing for the cointegrating rank of a VAR process with structural shifts+Saikkonen, P; Lutkepohl, H+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 2000"

We find that regime switches identified by ad hoc measures of lumpy investment do not adequately distinguish expansionary from replacement activities. In fact, during periods of expansion, firms spend just as much on replacement capital.

Wages and Ageing: Is There Evidence for the 'Inverse-U' Profile?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2009.00582.x,JUN 2010,37,6,"How individual wages change with time is one of the crucial determinants of labour market decisions including the timing of retirement. The focus of this paper is the relationship between age and wages with special attention given to individuals nearing retirement. The analysis is presented in a comparative context for Britain and Germany looking at two longitudinal data sets (BHPS and SOEP, respectively) for the years 1995-2004. We show the importance of cohort effects and selection out of employment which determine the downward-sloping part of the 'inverse-U' profile observed in cross-sections.

Our paper differs from the previous literature in the context of consistency proof. Tests that are robust to the identification problem are also analysed. These are Anderson-Rubin and Kleibergen types of test statistics. We also conduct a simulation study wherein we compare empirical likelihood and continuous updating-based tests with exponential tilting (ET)-based ones. The designs involve GARCH(1,1) and contaminated structural errors. We find that ET-based Kleibergen test has the best size among these competitors.","C2,C4,C5","EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATORS,IDENTIFICATION,GMM,INFERENCE,MODELS","Caner, Mehmet@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Caner, Mehmet@North Carolina State University@University of North Carolina",not exist,"ESTIMATION OF THE PARAMETERS OF A SINGLE EQUATION IN A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS+ANDERSON, TW; RUBIN, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1949::Empirical process methods in econometrics+Andrews, D.

The main objective was to focus on the quantification of the impact of imports on margins, and understand why, despite trade liberalization, price-cost margins have not fallen overall. On average, imports would have contributed to a large decrease of five percentage points in the price-cost margins. However, these effects seem to have been partially counterbalanced by the impacts of financial deepening and disinflation.","F12,F16,L11,L13,L60,J50","INTERNATIONAL-TRADE,PANEL DATA,MODELS,MARKET,PRODUCTIVITY,PERFORMANCE,EQUATIONS","Boulhol, Herve@Univ Paris Pantheon Sorbonne, F-75010 Paris, France","Boulhol, Herve@heSam Universite@Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne",not exist,"FORMULATION AND ESTIMATION OF DYNAMIC-MODELS USING PANEL DATA+ANDERSON, TW; HSIAO, C+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1982::Testing for weak instruments in linear IV regression+Yogo, M.; Stock, J.

We develop a model that simultaneously controls for the determinants of individual membership status and for the selection of employees into occupations according to union coverage. We find a negative association between membership and satisfaction. However, having accounted for selection effects, we find that the negative association is confined to non-covered employees. This is consistent with 'voice' effects, whereby non-covered members voice dissatisfaction to achieve union goals, and with the possibility that membership increases preferences for collective bargaining, thus lowering members' satisfaction in non-covered environments.","J28,J51",UNION MEMBERSHIP,"Bryson, Alex@Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London SW1P 3HE, England::Cappellari, Lorenzo@Univ Cattolica, Ist Econ Impresa & Lavoro, I-20123 Milan, Italy::Lucifora, Claudio@Univ Cattolica, Ist Econ Impresa & Lavoro, I-20123 Milan, Italy@IZA, Bonn, Germany@ERMES, Paris, France","Bryson, Alex@Unknow::Cappellari, Lorenzo@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart::Lucifora, Claudio@IZA Institute Labor Economics@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart","Cappellari, Lorenzo@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6791-3494::LUCIFORA, Claudio@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6352-1709","Job Queues and Union Status of Workers+Abowd, J.; Farber, H.+Industrial and Labor Relations Review+1983::no title+Airey, C.; Hales, J.; Hamilton, R.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Korovessis, C.; McKernan, A.; Purdon, S</span>.+The workplace employee relations survey, 1997-8 technical report+1999::no title+BACH S+UNION ORG ACTIVITY+2004::Job satisfaction, trade unions, and exit-voice revisited+Bender, KA; Sloane, PJ+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+JAN 1998::Union relative wage effects in the usa and the uk+Blanchflower, D; Bryson, A.+P 56 ANN M IND REL R+2004::no title+Booth, A.L.+The Economics of the Trade Union+1995::JOB SATISFACTION, WAGES, AND UNIONS+BORJAS, GJ+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+1979::Does union membership really reduce job satisfaction?+Bryson, A; Cappellari, L; Lucifora, C+BRITISH JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS+SEP 2004::Worker Needs and Voice in the US and the UK+Bryson, A; Freeman, R.+NBER Working Paper 12310+2006::Satisfaction and comparison income+Clark, AE; Oswald, AJ+JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS+SEP 1996::no title+FARBER H+452 PRINC U+2001::no title+Forth, J.; Bewley, H.; Bryson, A.+Small and medium-sized enterprises: Findings from the 2004 workplace employment relations survey+2006::no title+Freeman, R; Rogers, J.+What workers want+1999::no title+Freeman, R.

For example, a one-third reduction in poverty severity from proxy-means test transfer schemes based on OLS method to focused transfer schemes requires only a few hours of computer work based on methods available on popular statistical packages.

The income effect at the micro level is modelled non-parametrically, so as to flexibly reflect potentially complex distributional changes. Our proposed method is illustrated using data for Morocco and Vietnam, and the results offer some surprising insights into the observed aggregate gains in schooling attainments.","D31,I21,O15","NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,EFFICIENCY,POVERTY,WEALTH","Lambert, Sylvie@Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France::Ravallion, Martin@World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA::van de Walle, Dominique@World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA","Lambert, Sylvie@Paris School of Economics::Ravallion, Martin@The World Bank::van de Walle, Dominique@The World Bank",not exist,"HUMAN-DEVELOPMENT IN POOR COUNTRIES - ON THE ROLE OF PRIVATE INCOMES AND PUBLIC-SERVICES+ANAND, S; RAVALLION, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+WIN 1993::POVERTY, HUMAN-DEVELOPMENT, AND GROWTH - AN EMERGING CONSENSUS+ATURUPANE, H; GLEWWE, P; ISENMAN, P+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1994::Household income and child schooling in Vietnam+Behrman, JR; Knowles, JC+WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1999::GROWTH AND EQUITY IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES - A REINTERPRETATION OF THE SRI-LANKAN EXPERIENCE+BHALLA, SS; GLEWWE, P+WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1986::Modeling the effects of nutritional and socioeconomic factors on the growth and morbidity of Kenyan school children+Bhargava, A+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY+1999::Decomposing social indicators using distributional data+Bidani, B; Ravallion, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR 1997::WAGE DISCRIMINATION - REDUCED FORM AND STRUCTURAL ESTIMATES+BLINDER, AS+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+1973::no title+*COMM SPEC ED FORM+REG SYST ED FORM MAR+1999::GROWTH AND REDISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN POVERTY MEASURES - A DECOMPOSITION WITH APPLICATIONS TO BRAZIL AND INDIA IN THE 1980S+DATT, G; RAVALLION, M+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+APR 1992::The comparative efficiency of national health systems in producing health: An analysis of 191 countries+Evans, D.; Tandon, A.; Murray, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lauer, J</span>.+GPE Discussion Paper No. 29+2000::The effect of household wealth on educational attainment: Evidence from 35 countries+Filmer, D; Pritchett, L+POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW+MAR 1999::Economic growth and the demand for education: is there a wealth effect?+Glewwe, P; Jacoby, HG+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+JUN 2004::no title+*GOV DON NGO WORK+VIETN ATT POV VIETN+1999::The efficiency of government expenditure - Experiences from Africa+Gupta, S; Verhoeven, M+JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING+MAY 2001::ASYMPTOTICALLY OPTIMAL DIFFERENCE-BASED ESTIMATION OF VARIANCE IN NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION+HALL, P; KAY, JW; TITTERINGTON, DM+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1990::Efficiency in reaching the millennium development goals+Jayasuriya, R; Wodon, Q.+World Bank Working Paper No. 9+2003::Difference-based semiparametric estimation of partial linear regression models+Lokshin, Michael+STATA JOURNAL+2006::no title+MOORE M+OLITY QUALITIES GOVE+1999::Trends in the education sector+Nguyen, N.+Economic growth, poverty, and household welfare in Vietnam+2004::Male-female wage differentials in urban labor markets+Oaxaca, RL.+International Economic Review+1973::no title+PRITCHETT L+J HUM RESOUR+1996::Economic growth and human development+Ranis, G; Stewart, F; Ramirez, A+WORLD DEVELOPMENT+FEB 2000::On measuring aggregate ""social efficiency""+Ravallion, M+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+JAN 2005::PUBLIC ACTION AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES+SEN, A+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+1981::no title+SEN AK+RURAL POVERTY S ASIA+1988::Human resources: empirical modeling of household and family decisions+Strauss, J.; Thomas, D.+HDB DEV EC+1995::no title+no author+Human Development Report+1996::The static and dynamic incidence of Vietnam's public safety net+Van de Walle, D.+Economic growth, poverty and household welfare in Vietnam+2004::Sources of ethnic inequality in Viet Nam+van de Walle, D; Gunewardena, D+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+JUN 2001::no title+WANG J+HLTH NUTR POPULATION+1999::no title+*WORLD BANK+16598MOR WORLD BANK+1997::no title+*WORLD BANK+16598MOR WORLD BANK+1997::no title+no author+Kingdom of Morocco: Poverty Update+2001::no title+*WORLD BANK+VIETN LIV STAN UNPUB+2000::no title+*WORLD BANK+VIETN LIV STAN UNPUB+1995::no title+no author+World Development Report: Investing in Health+1993::no title+no author+The World Health report: making a difference+1999::Nonparametric regression techniques in economics+Yatchew, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+JUN 1998"

Using data from Indonesia, it is shown that the economic costs related to the death of children and older persons seem to be fully compensated for by the decrease in consumption units. In contrast, when prime-age adults die, survivors face additional costs and, in consequence, use coping strategies. These strategies seem to be quite effective, although households may face higher long-term vulnerability.","D12,I12,J12,O12","ADULT MORTALITY,ECONOMIC SHOCKS,RURAL ETHIOPIA,SOUTH-AFRICA,INCOME,HEALTH,HOUSEHOLDS,EMPLOYMENT,AGE","Grimm, Michael@Erasmus Univ, Inst Social Studies, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands","Grimm, Michael@Erasmus University Rotterdam",not exist,"SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::Labor effects of adult mortality in Tanzanian households+Beegle, K+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+APR 2005::Adult mortality and consumption growth in the age of HIV/AIDS+Beegle, Kathleen; de Weerdt, Joachim; Dercon, Stefan+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+JAN 2008::[not available]+CAMERON LA+REV DEV EC+2003::no title+CROSSLEY TF+26 SEDAP RES MCMAST+2000::Economies of scale, household size, and the demand for food+Deaton, A; Parson, C+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 1998::no title+Deaton, Angus.+Understanding Consumption+1992::Aging and inequality in income and health+Deaton, AS; Paxson, CH+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1998::Risk, insurance, and poverty: A review+Dercon, S.+Insurance Against Poverty+2005::Growth and shocks: evidence from rural Ethiopia+Dercon, S+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+AUG 2004::In sickness and in health: Risk sharing within households in rural Ethiopia+Dercon, S; Krishnan, P+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+AUG 2000::Economic shocks, wealth, and welfare+Frankenberg, E; Smith, JP; Thomas, D+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SPR 2003::Insuring consumption against illness+Gertler, P; Gruber, J+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 2002::Schooling and parental death+Gertler, P; Levine, DI; Ames, M+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2004::Air quality and early-life mortality: evidence from Indonesia's wildfires+Jayachandran, S.+May NBER Working Paper no. 14011+2008::Surviving Unemployment Without State Support: Unemployment and Household Formation in South Africa+Klasen, Stephan; Woolard, Ingrid+JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES+JAN 2009::EXPLAINING HOUSEHOLD VULNERABILITY TO IDIOSYNCRATIC INCOME SHOCKS+KOCHAR, A+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1995::Health shocks in China: Are the poor and uninsured less protected?+Lindelow, M.; Wagstaff, A.+World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 3740+2005::no title+MATHER D+MSU INT DEV WORKING+2004::Agricultural prices, food consumption, and the health and productivity of Indonesian farmers.+Pitt, M.

In this article, we present a statistical model that can be used to allocate unemployed into different ALMPs. The model presented is a duration model that uses the timing-of-events framework to identify causal effects. We compare different assignment rules, and the results suggest that a significant reduction in the average duration of unemployment may result if a statistical treatment rule is introduced.","J64,J68","LABOR-MARKET PROGRAMS,NONPARAMETRIC IDENTIFICATION,UI SYSTEM,PREDICTION,THREAT,IMPACTS,MODELS,TIME","Staghoj, Jonas@Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark::Svarer, Michael@Aarhus Univ, Sch Econ & Management, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark::Rosholm, Michael@Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business, Dept Econ, DK-8230 Aabyhoj, Denmark","Staghoj, Jonas@Aarhus University::Svarer, Michael@Aarhus University::Rosholm, Michael@Aarhus University",not exist,"The nonparametric identification of treatment effects in duration models+Abbring, JH; Van den Berg, GJ+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2003::no title+ARNKIL R+GLOBAL LABOUR MARKET+2008::Selective incapacitation and the problem of prediction+Auerhahn, K+CRIMINOLOGY+NOV 1999::no title+BEHNCKE S+J I COMP CESIFO DICE+2006::Targeting labour market programmes: results from a randomized experiment+Behncke, S; Frolich, M; Lechner, M.+Work.

Using a panel of schools for all state-funded secondary schools in England (1992-2006), we find that only about one-third of the improvement in school exam scores is directly attributable to the combined effect of these three major education reforms. The distributional consequences of the policy, however, are estimated to have been favourable, with the greatest gains being achieved by schools with the highest proportion of pupils from poor families.","I20,I21,I28","SPECIALIST SCHOOLS PROGRAM,PUBLIC-SCHOOLS,COMPETITION,PERFORMANCE,EFFICIENCY,IMPACT,ACHIEVEMENT,VOUCHERS,QUALITY,SIZE","Bradley, Steve@Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Lancaster, England::Taylor, Jim@Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Lancaster, England","Bradley, Steve@Lancaster University::Taylor, Jim@Lancaster University",not exist,"no title+Andrews, M.; Bradley, S.; Stott, D.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Taylor, J</span>.+The evolution and determinants of the educational gender gap in England+2006::On the political economy of means-tested education vouchers+Bearse, P; Glomm, G; Ravikumar, B+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2000::QUALITY COMPETITION AND PUBLIC-SCHOOLS - FURTHER EVIDENCE+BLAIR, JP; STALEY, S+ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW+JUN 1995::Student academic achievement and the degree of market concentration+Borland, Melvin V.; Howsen, Roy M.+Economics of Education Review+1992::The effect of competition on the efficiency of secondary schools in England+Bradley, S; Johnes, G; Millington, J+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+DEC 16 2001::Ethnicity, educational attainment and the transition from school+Bradley, S; Taylor, J+MANCHESTER SCHOOL+JUN 2004::Testing for quasi-market forces in secondary education+Bradley, S; Crouchley, R; Millington, J; et al.+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+JUL 2000::The effect of school size on exam performance in secondary schools+Bradley, S; Taylor, J+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1998::no title+Casson, R.; Kingdom, G.+Tackling low educational achievement+2007::Could do better: The effectiveness of incentives and competition in schools+De Fraja, G; Landeras, P+JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS+JAN 2006::no title+DEFRAJA G+CEPR DISCUSSION PAPE+2005::no title+*DEP ED SCI+ED REF GOV PROP SCH+1988::Equity and resources: An analysis of education finance systems+Fernandez, R.; Rogerson, R.+Working Paper 7111+1999::no title+Fiske, E.

This restrictive assumption is unnecessary if one defines a coincident index as an estimate of monthly real gross domestic products (GDP). This paper estimates Gaussian vector autoregression (VAR) and factor models for latent monthly real GDP and other coincident indicators using the observable mixed-frequency series. For maximum likelihood estimation of a VAR model, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm helps in finding a good starting value for a quasi-Newton method. The smoothed estimate of latent monthly real GDP is a natural extension of the Stock-Watson coincident index.","C32,C43,C82,E32","BUSINESS-CYCLE,DYNAMIC FACTOR,EM ALGORITHM,FACTOR MODEL,TIME-SERIES,INDICATORS,INTERPOLATION","Mariano, Roberto S.@Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore::Murasawa, Yasutomo@Osaka Prefecture Univ, Sch Econ, Osaka 5998531, Japan","Mariano, Roberto S.@Singapore Management University::Murasawa, Yasutomo@Osaka Prefecture University","MARIANO, Roberto@D-1442-2009::Murasawa, Yasutomo@F-6327-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6716-0162","Systematic Monetary Policy and the Effects of Oil Price Shocks+Bernanke, B.; Gertler, M.; Watson, M.+Brookings Papers on Economic Activity+1997::no title+Brockwell, P.

Based on these surveys, the European Commission constructs an aggregate European Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI). This paper compares the ESI with more sophisticated aggregation schemes based on statistical methods: dynamic factor analysis and partial least squares. The indicator based on partial least squares clearly outperforms the other two indicators in terms of comovement with economic activity.

Testing the Stochastic Implications of the Permanent Income Hypothesis Using Canadian Provincial Data,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2009.00565.x,FEB 2010,29,2,"This paper utilizes relatively unexplored Canadian provincial-level data to investigate an old but still relevant question in macroeconomics as to whether consumption responds to income innovations in a manner consistent with the stochastic implications of the permanent income hypothesis (PIH). The empirical results obtained do not appear to be in accord with the PIH. Instead, consumption's response to income innovations is found to be much weaker than that predicted by PIH; in particular, the response displays an asymmetric pattern in the sense that it is much stronger for negative than positive income innovations. We interpret this evidence of asymmetry as indicative of the presence of liquidity constraints in provincial households.","E20,E21,R10","AGGREGATE CONSUMPTION,LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS,EXCESS SMOOTHNESS,TIME-SERIES,LIFE-CYCLE,PANEL DATA,UNIT-ROOT,US STATES,EXPECTATIONS,ADJUSTMENT","Dejuan, Joseph P.@Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Seater, John J.@N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA::Wirjanto, Tony S.@Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Dejuan, Joseph P.@University of Waterloo::Seater, John J.@University of North Carolina@North Carolina State University::Wirjanto, Tony S.@University of Waterloo",not exist,"Consumption and Investment+ABEL, A.+HDB MONETARY EC+1990::TESTING THE RESPONSE OF CONSUMPTION TO INCOME CHANGES WITH (NOISY) PANEL DATA+ALTONJI, JG; SIOW, A+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1987::Consumption over the life cycle and over the business cycle+Attanasio, OP; Browning, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1995::Consumption and credit constraints: International evidence+Bacchetta, P; Gerlach, S+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+OCT 1997::ADJUSTMENT COSTS, DURABLES, AND AGGREGATE CONSUMPTION+BERNANKE, B+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+1985::THE RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS APPROACH TO THE CONSUMPTION FUNCTION - A MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY+BILSON, JFO+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1980::CANADIAN EVIDENCE ON THE PERMANENT INCOME RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS+CUDDINGTON, JT+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE+1982::Economic information versus quality variation in cross-country data+Dawson, JW; DeJuan, JP; Seater, JJ; et al.+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE+NOV 2001::no title+Deaton, Angus.+Understanding Consumption+1992::A direct test of the permanent income hypothesis with an application to the US states+Dejuan, JP; Seater, JJ; Wirjanto, TS+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+DEC 2004::THE EXCESS SMOOTHNESS OF CONSUMPTION - IDENTIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION+FLAVIN, M+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1993::THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONSUMPTION TO CHANGING EXPECTATIONS ABOUT FUTURE INCOME+FLAVIN, MA+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1981::no title+Friedman, M.+A Theory of the Consumption Function+1957::TIME-SERIES MODELING AND INTERPRETATION+GRANGER, CWJ; MORRIS, MJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1976::STOCHASTIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE LIFE CYCLE PERMANENT INCOME HYPOTHESIS - THEORY AND EVIDENCE+HALL, RE+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1978::no title+KOTLIKOFF L+1492 NAT BUR EC RES+1984::TESTING THE NULL HYPOTHESIS OF STATIONARITY AGAINST THE ALTERNATIVE OF A UNIT-ROOT - HOW SURE ARE WE THAT ECONOMIC TIME-SERIES HAVE A UNIT-ROOT+KWIATKOWSKI, D; PHILLIPS, PCB; SCHMIDT, P; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT-DEC 1992::Critical Values for Co-integration Tests+MacKinnon, J.

We show that there is a substantial cross-country heterogeneity in reactions across 50 equity markets worldwide, with returns falling on average around 2.7% in response to a 100 basis point tightening of US monetary policy, but ranging from a zero response in some to a reaction of 5% or more in other markets. As to the determinants of the strength of transmission to individual countries, we test the relevance of their macroeconomic policies and the role of real and financial integration. We find that in particular the degree of global integration of countries - and not a country's bilateral integration with the United States - is a key determinant for the transmission process.","F36,F30,G15","INTERNATIONAL TRANSMISSION,BUSINESS CYCLES,EQUITY MARKETS,EXCHANGE-RATES,STOCK MARKETS,US SHOCKS,RETURNS,TIME,VOLATILITY","Ehrmann, Michael@European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany::Fratzscher, Marcel@European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany","Ehrmann, Michael@European Central Bank::Fratzscher, Marcel@European Central Bank",not exist,"INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS CYCLES+AHMED, S; ICKES, BW; WANG, P; et al.+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1993::Real-time price discovery in global stock, bond and foreign exchange markets+Andersen, Torben G.; Bollerslev, Tim; Diebold, Francis X.; et al.+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+NOV 2007::no title+*BANK INT SETTL+BIS PAP+2003::BUSINESS CYCLES AND THE EXCHANGE-RATE REGIME - SOME INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE+BAXTER, M; STOCKMAN, AC+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 1989::TIME-VARYING WORLD MARKET INTEGRATION+BEKAERT, G; HARVEY, CR+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUN 1995::What explains the stock market's reaction to Federal Reserve Policy?+Bernanke, BS; Kuttner, KN+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUN 2005::no title+BOMFIM A+J BANK FINANC+2001::Financial Openness and Growth: Short-run Gain, Long-run Pain?+Bussiere, Matthieu; Fratzscher, Marcel+REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+FEB 2008::Are European business cycles close enough to be just one?+Camacho, Maximo; Perez-Quiros, Gabriel; Saiz, Lorena+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+SEP-OCT 2006::Have individual stocks become more volatile?

Modelling Regime-Specific Stock Price Volatility,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2009.00563.x,DEC 2009,82,12,"Single-state generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models identify only one mechanism governing the response of volatility to market shocks, and the conditional higher moments are constant, unless modelled explicitly. So they neither capture state-dependent behaviour of volatility nor explain why the equity index skew persists into long-dated options. Markov switching (MS) GARCH models specify several volatility states with endogenous conditional skewness and kurtosis; of these the simplest to estimate is normal mixture (NM) GARCH, which has constant state probabilities. We introduce a state-dependent leverage effect to NM-GARCH and thereby explain the observed characteristics of equity index returns and implied volatility skews, without resorting to time-varying volatility risk premia. An empirical study on European equity indices identifies two-state asymmetric NM-GARCH as the best fit of the 15 models considered. During stable markets volatility behaviour is broadly similar across all indices, but the crash probability and the behaviour of returns and volatility during a crash depends on the index. The volatility mean-reversion and leverage effects during crash markets are quite different from those in the stable regime.","C32,G13","CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY,GARCH-MODELS,ASYMMETRIC VOLATILITY,MARKET VOLATILITY,RISK-AVERSION,OPTION PRICES,ARCH MODELS,RETURNS,STATIONARITY,INFERENCE","Alexander, Carol@Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, ICMA Ctr, Reading RG6 6BA, Berks, England::Lazar, Emese@Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, ICMA Ctr, Reading RG6 6BA, Berks, England","Alexander, Carol@University of Reading::Lazar, Emese@University of Reading","Lazar, Emese@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8761-0754","On the stationarity of Markov-switching Garch processes+Abramson, Ari; Cohen, Israel+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 2007::Nonparametric risk management and implied risk aversion+Ait-Sahalia, Y; Lo, AW+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 2000::Normal mixture GARCH(1,1): Applications to exchange rate modelling+Alexander, C; Lazar, E+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+APR 2006::no title+BAI X+MERTONS UTOPIA 1 EFF+2001::Kurtosis of GARCH and stochastic volatility models with non-normal innovations+Bai, XZ; Russell, JR; Tiao, GC+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2003::Stock return characteristics, Skew laws, and the differential pricing of individual equity options+Bakshi, G; Kapadia, N; Madan, D+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+SPR 2003::no title+BATES DS+ADV FUT OPT+1997::Empirical option pricing: a retrospection+Bates, DS+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP-OCT 2003::Post-'87 crash fears in the S&amp;P 500 futures option market+Bates, DS+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 2000::THE CRASH OF 87 - WAS IT EXPECTED - THE EVIDENCE FROM OPTIONS MARKETS+BATES, DS+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUL 1991::no title+BAUWENS L+0733 CIRPEE+2007::no title+BAUWENS L+200611 CORE+2006::Multivariate mixed normal conditional heteroskedasticity+Bauwens, L.; Hafner, C.

Capital Services Growth in the UK: 1950 to 2006,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2009.00568.x,DEC 2009,20,5,"This paper describes a capital services dataset for the United Kingdom developed for use in empirical work, and some of its key features. The estimates are consistent with National Accounts output estimates, making them ideal for use in growth-accounting or business-cycle analysis. The divergence between the volume of capital services and the volume of the capital stock after 1980 is highlighted. This divergence is driven by a shift in investment towards short-lived and more productive information and communication technology assets for which the flow of capital services is high. Standard capital stock measures understate growth in the productive input of capital, especially after 1990.","E22,O47",UNITED-KINGDOM,"Wallis, Gavin@UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England","Wallis, Gavin@University College London@University of London",not exist,"New measures of UK private sector software investment+Chamberlin, G.; Clayton, T.; Farooqui, S.+Economic &amp; Labour Market Review+2007::THE STOCK OF FIXED CAPITAL IN THE UNITED-KINGDOM IN 1961+DEAN, G+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-GENERAL+1964::The Measurement of Depreciation in the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts+Fraumeni, B.

Productivity and Trade Orientation in UK Manufacturing,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2009.00564.x,DEC 2009,42,6,"We show that improvements in aggregate productivity in UK manufacturing during the first years after the implementation of the Euro, by the UK's main trading partners in Europe, are determined by both market share reallocation and within-company productivity growth. Furthermore, we outline a structural methodology for estimating parameters of a production function linking the unobservable productivity to endogenous company-level trade orientation, investment and exit decisions. This allows us to back out consistent and unbiased estimates of productivity dynamics by trade orientation of companies within four-digit UK manufacturing industries using FAME data over the period 1994-2001. Our estimates of productivity dynamics indicate that improvements in aggregate productivity were mainly driven by market share reallocations away from inefficient and towards efficient exporting companies alongside productivity improvements within non-exporting companies.","F14,D24","EXPORT,ENTRY,FIRMS,EXIT,LIBERALIZATION,COLOMBIA,DYNAMICS,INPUTS,PLANTS,COSTS","Rizov, Marian@Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London N17 8HR, England@Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands@Burroughs, London NW4 4BT, England::Walsh, Patrick Paul@Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, UCD SPIRe & Geary Inst, Dublin 4, Ireland","Rizov, Marian@Middlesex University@Wageningen University & Research::Walsh, Patrick Paul@University College Dublin","Rizov, Marian@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8895-1980","Econometric tools for analyzing market outcomes+Ackerberg, D; Berry, S; Benkard, L<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Pakes, A</span>.+HDB ECONOMETRICS A+2007::Structural Identification of Production Functions+Ackerberg, D.

In empirical studies, this choice is motivated by stochastic singularity or collinearity problems associated with the covariance matrix of impulse response functions. Consequently, the asymptotic distribution cannot be used to test the economic model's fit. To circumvent this difficulty, we propose a simple simulation method to construct critical values for the test statistics. An empirical application with US data illustrates the proposed method.","C15,C32,E32",MONETARY-POLICY,"Feve, Patrick@Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ & IDEI, F-31000 Toulouse, France@IUF, F-31000 Toulouse, France@Banque France, DGEI DEMFI, F-75049 Paris 1, France::Matheron, Julien@Banque France, DGEI DEMS SEPS, F-75049 Paris 1, France::Sahuc, Jean-Guillaume@Banque France, DGEI DEMS SEPS, F-75049 Paris 1, France@Audencia Sch Management, Nantes, France","Feve, Patrick@Toulouse School of Economics@Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)@Universite de Toulouse@PSL Research University Paris (ComUE)@Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Matheron, Julien@Unknow::Sahuc, Jean-Guillaume@Audencia",not exist,"no title+ALTIG D+11034 NBER+2005::Estimation and control of an optimization-based model with sticky prices and wages+Amato, JD; Laubach, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+MAY 2003::Returns to scale in US production: Estimates and implications+Basu, S; Fernald, JG+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+APR 1997::Has monetary policy become more effective?+Boivin, Jean; Giannoni, Marc P.+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 2006::no title+CANOVA F+BACK SQUARE ON UNPUB+2006::Monetary policy shocks: What we have learned and to what end?+Christiano, L.

Moreover, productivity of entrants to exporting, but not that of non-exporters and exporters, increases in response to increases in foreign income, before entry but not after that.

The first model assumes that households update their expectations towards survey measures. In the second model, households update their expectations towards rational expectations (RE). While the literature has used these specifications indistinguishably, we argue that there are important differences. The two models imply different updating probabilities, and the data seem to prefer the second one. We then analyse the properties of both models in terms of mean expectations, median expectations, and a measure of disagreement among households. The model with periodical updates towards RE also seems to fit the data better along these dimensions.","D84,E31","INFLATION-EXPECTATIONS,PHILLIPS-CURVE,DYNAMICS","Nunes, Ricardo@Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA","Nunes, Ricardo@Federal Reserve System Board of Governors@Federal Reserve System - USA","nipe, cef@A-4218-2010","no title+ADAM KK+222 EUR CENTR BANK+2003::Are inflation expectations rational?+Andolfatto, David; Hendry, Scott; Moran, Kevin+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAR 2008::The theory of rationally heterogeneous expectations: Evidence from survey data on inflation expectations+Branch, WA+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JUL 2004::A simple recursive forecasting model+Branch, WA; Evans, GW+ECONOMICS LETTERS+MAY 2006::no title+CARRERO JJ+NUTRAFOODS+2004::Macroeconomic expectations of households and professional forecasters+Carroll, CD+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2003::no title+CROUSHORE D+9814 FED RES BANK PH+1998::&lt;IT&gt;Inflation expectations: theoretical models and empirical tests&lt;/IT&gt;+Curtin, R.+NAT BANK POL WORKSH+2006::Dynamic inconsistencies: Counterfactual implications of a class of rational-expectations models+Estrella, A; Fuhrer, JC+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 2002::European inflation dynamics+Gali, J; Gertler, M; Lopez-Salido, JD+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2001::Inflation dynamics: A structural econometric analysis+Gali, J; Gertler, M+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+OCT 1999::Estimates of the sticky-information Phillips curve for the United States+Khan, H; Zhu, ZH+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+FEB 2006::no title+Mankiw, N.G.; Reis, R.; Wolfers, J.+Disagreement about Inflation Expectations.

Simplified Implementation of the Heckman Estimator of the Dynamic Probit Model and a Comparison with Alternative Estimators*,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2009.00554.x,OCT 2009,36,64,"This paper presents a convenient shortcut method for implementing the Heckman estimator of the dynamic random effects probit model and other dynamic nonlinear panel data models using standard software. It then compares the estimators proposed by Heckman, Orme and Wooldridge, based on three alternative approximations, first in an empirical model for the probability of unemployment and then in a set of simulation experiments. The results indicate that none of the three estimators dominates the other two in all cases. In most cases, all three estimators display satisfactory performance, except when the number of time periods is very small.","C23,C25,C13,C51","LAGGED DEPENDENT-VARIABLES,PANEL-DATA MODELS,STATE DEPENDENCE,UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY,TIME-SERIES,UNEMPLOYMENT,EMPLOYMENT,HEALTH,FIRMS,UK","Arulampalam, Wiji@Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England@IZA, Bonn, Germany::Stewart, Mark B.@Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Arulampalam, Wiji@University of Warwick@IZA Institute Labor Economics::Stewart, Mark B.@University of Warwick","Stewart, Mark@A-9496-2008","Ownership of stocks and mutual funds: A panel data analysis+Alessie, R; Hochguertel, S; van Soest, A+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 2004::The Persistence of Welfare Participation+Andren, T.+Working Papers in Economics No. 266+2007::Practitioners' corner - A note on estimated coefficients in random effects probit models+Arulampalam, W+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1999::Unemployment persistence+Arulampalam, W; Booth, AL; Taylor, MP+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 2000::Sibling death clustering in India: state dependence versus unobserved heterogeneity+Arulampalam, Wiji; Bhalotra, Sonia+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2006::Luck, effort, and reward in an organizational hierarchy+Audas, R; Barmby, T; Treble, J+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+APR 2004::Hard times or great expectations?

The general state space formulation of the periodic model allows for exact maximum likelihood estimation, signal extraction and forecasting. The consequences for model-based seasonal adjustment are discussed. The new periodic model is applied to postwar monthly US unemployment series from which we identify a significant periodic stochastic cycle.

However, a block bootstrapped version of the test can remedy the size distortion when the time series length divided by the number of countries T/n is sufficiently large.

For this setting, we propose a new simple Wald test for conditional Sigma-convergence. According to our Monte Carlo simulations, this test performs well and its power is comparable with the available tests of unconditional convergence. We apply two versions of the test to conditional convergence in the size of European manufacturing firms.

A Semiparametric Analysis of the Term Structure of the US Interest Rates,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/j.1468-0084.2008.00546.x,AUG 2009,48,5,"The short end of the US$ term structure of interest rates is analysed allowing for the possibility of fractional integration and cointegration. This approach permits mean-reverting dynamics for the data and the existence of a common long run stochastic trend to be maintained simultaneously. We estimate the model for the period 1963-2006 and find it compatible with this structure. The restriction that the data are I(1) and the errors are I(0) is rejected, mainly because the latter still display long memory. This result is consistent with a model of monetary policy in which the Central Bank operates affecting contracts with short term maturity, and the impulses are transmitted to contracts with longer maturities and then to the final goals. However, the transmission of the impulses along the term structure cannot be modelled using the Expectations Hypothesis.","C22,E43","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,LONG-RANGE DEPENDENCE,TIME-SERIES,FRACTIONAL SYSTEMS,EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS,COINTEGRATION ANALYSIS,NONSTATIONARY,MEMORY,PARAMETER,MODELS","Iacone, Fabrizio@Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Iacone, Fabrizio@University of York - UK","Iacone, Fabrizio@P-5855-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2681-9036","A no-arbitrage vector autoregression of term structure dynamics with macroeconomic and latent variables+Ang, A;

Using Spanish panel data on income and consumption for the period 1987-96, we find noticeable differences across these groups in the evolution of income inequality, and in the relative importance of the transitory and permanent components of income variance. The evolution of inequality is mainly explained by movements in the transitory component for the self-employed and by the permanent component for the employees. Our results suggest that different policies should be implemented for each group.","D12,D31,D91,E21","EARNINGS,UNCERTAINTY,DYNAMICS,TRENDS,MEN,UK","Albarran, Pedro@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain::Carrasco, Raquel@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain::Martinez-Granado, Maite@Univ Basque Country, NAIDER, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain@Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain","Albarran, Pedro@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Carrasco, Raquel@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Martinez-Granado, Maite@University of Basque Country","Martinez-Granado, Maite@P-6173-2014::Carrasco, Raquel@H-5596-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2550-6350::Martinez-Granado, Maite@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0095-0893","no title+ALBARRAN P+0008 CTR EST MON FIN+2000::Dynamics and seasonality in quarterly panel data: An analysis of earnings mobility in Spain+Alvarez, J+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 2004::Earnings dynamics and inequality among Canadian men, 1976-1992: Evidence from longitudinal income tax records+Baker, M; Solon, G+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+APR 2003::no title+BLUNDELL R+AM ECON REV+2008::Consumption inequality and income uncertainty+Blundell, R; Preston, I+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1998::Household saving: Micro theories and micro facts+Browning, M; Lusardi, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+DEC 1996::The role of employer/employee interactions in labor market cycles: Evidence from the self-employed+Carrington, WJ; McCue, K; Pierce, B+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+OCT 1996::no title+CERVINI P+PERMANENT TRAN UNPUB+2006::La medicion de la desigualdad a traves de un modelo de eleccion intertemporal+Cutanda, A.+Hacienda Publica Espanola+2002::Intertemporal choice and inequality+Deaton, A.; Paxson, C.+Journal of Political Economy+1994::The evolution of individual male earnings in Great Britain: 1975-95+Dickens, R+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JAN 2000::no title+GUVENEN F+EMPIRICAL INVE UNPUB+2005::Does entrepreneurship pay?

The Impact of Degree Duration on Higher Education Participation: Evidence from a Large-scale Natural Experiment,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12231,OCT 2018,28,0,"This paper investigates the effects on enrolment, retention rate and on-time graduation of a nationwide Bologna Process reform introduced in Italy to establish BAs with a duration of three years, followed by optional second-tier degrees of two years, in place of single-tier degrees of four or five years. The analysis exploits exogenous delay of treatment conditions and the unique availability of microdata that cover the universe of the departments. We estimate that the reform boosted first-year enrolments by 14.5-17.3 percentage points, compared to a counterfactual status of no reform. This enrolment shift was due to participation gains rather than substitution effects, and it is likely to have persisted in the longer term. Moreover, no trade-off between increased participation and deteriorated retention and on-time graduation emerged.",,"TUITION FEES,DROP-OUT,ENROLLMENT,PROGRAMS,DEMAND","Bondonio, Daniele@Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Law & Polit Econ & Social Sci, Via Cavour 84, I-15121 Alessandria, Italy::Berton, Fabio@Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Stat, Lungo Dora Siena 100, I-10153 Turin, Italy","Bondonio, Daniele@University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro::Berton, Fabio@University of Turin",not exist,"Too much of a good thing?

The Effect of PhD Funding on Postdegree Research Career and Publication Productivity,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12232,OCT 2018,22,0,"This paper explores the extent to which PhD funding encourages postdegree research career and leads to publications. Using novel data on Italian PhD graduates, I find positive modest effects of funding both on pursuing a research career and on publication productivity within a few years after graduation. The results are robust to a battery of checks and different model specifications. I also provide evidence that funded students invest more in research-oriented activities and spend less time on outside (non-research) work during the PhD, thus highlighting mechanisms that potentially account for the effect of funding.",,"RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENT,ACHIEVEMENT EVIDENCE,STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT,COMPLETION,INCENTIVES,ECONOMICS,CONSEQUENCES,OUTCOMES,MARKET,RATES","Nistico, Roberto@Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy@Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy","Nistico, Roberto@University of Naples Federico II",not exist,"Long-term educational consequences of secondary school vouchers: Evidence from administrative records in Colombia+Angrist, J; Bettinger, E; Kremer, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2006::The Effects of High Stakes High School Achievement Awards: Evidence from a Randomized Trial+Angrist, Joshua; Lavy, Victor+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 2009::The impact of NSF support on basic research in economics+Arora, A.; Gambardella, A.+Annales d'Economie et des Statistiques+2005::What does performance in graduate school predict?

Uncertainty and the Great Recession,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12229,OCT 2018,23,0,"Has heightened uncertainty been a major contributor to the Great Recession and the slow recovery in the United States? To answer this question, we identify exogenous changes in six uncertainty proxies and quantify their contributions to GDP growth and the unemployment rate. The answer is no. In total we find that increased macroeconomic and financial uncertainty can explain up to 10% of the drop in GDP at the height of the recession and up to 0.6 percentage points of the increased unemployment rates in 2009 through 2011. Our calculations further suggest that only a minor part of the rise in popular uncertainty measures during the Great Recession was driven by exogenous uncertainty shocks.",,"MONETARY-POLICY,SHOCKS,IMPACT,DEMAND","Born, Benjamin@Univ Bonn, D-53113 Bonn, Germany@CEPR, D-53113 Bonn, Germany@CESifo, D-53113 Bonn, Germany::Breuer, Sebastian@German Council Econ Experts, Wiesbaden, Germany::Elstner, Steffen@RWI Essen, Essen, Germany","Born, Benjamin@Ifo Institut@University of Bonn::Breuer, Sebastian@Unknow::Elstner, Steffen@RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung",not exist,"Timevarying Business Volatility, Price Setting, and the Real Effects of Monetary Policy+Bachmann,, R.; Born,, B.; Elstner,, S.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Grimme,, C</span>.+CEPR Discussion Paper No. 9702+2013::Uncertainty and Economic Activity: Evidence from Business Survey Data+Bachmann, Ruediger; Elstner, Steffen; Sims, Eric R.+AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-MACROECONOMICS+APR 2013::Measuring Economic Policy Uncertainty+Baker, Scott R.; Bloom, Nicholas; Davis, Steven J.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2016::no title+Benati,, L.+Economic Policy Uncertainty and the Great Recession+2014::The Impact of Uncertainty Shocks+Bloom, Nicholas+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 2009::Fluctuations in Uncertainty+Bloom, Nicholas+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+SPR 2014::Policy risk and the business cycle+Born, Benjamin; Pfeifer, Johannes+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+NOV 2014::Uncertainty and Economic Activity: A Global Perspective+Cesa-Bianchi,, A.; Pesaran,, M.

Financial Constraints on German Firms after the Crisis: Evidence from Threshold Panel Estimation,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12206,OCT 2018,44,0,"This article studies the existence and magnitude of financial investment constraints in Germany between 2006 and 2012 with a special emphasis on small and medium-sized firms. The core contention is that the sensitivity of the investment rate to the cash flow rate is a function of a firm's financial position contributing to its access to external finance. The application of a nonlinear panel threshold model reveals that the marginal effect of the cash flow rate on the investment rate is almost twice as strong for high debt' firms compared to low debt' firms. This result holds for six out of seven balance sheet threshold variables. For a single specification, the results reveal a non-monotonic relationship between the cash flow rate and investment rate.

The Labour Market Effects of Increases in Social Insurance Premium: Evidence from Japan,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12226,OCT 2018,45,0,"Exploiting heterogeneous variations in labour cost increases due to Japan's 2003 social insurance premium reform as a natural experiment, we estimate the impacts of the increased social insurance premiums on employment, working hours and payroll costs. Using the difference-in-differences method with establishment fixed effects, we find that firms reduce the number of employees and increase average annual earnings from longer working hours in response to an exogenous increase in labour costs without productivity gains. Firms manage to pay for this increase in the average wage paid to the remaining workers by reducing the number of employees to keep total payroll costs unchanged. In contrast, since social insurance premiums are shared equally between employees and employers, firms pay the remaining half premiums that they are imposed with. Sub-sample analyses show that firms adhering to a labour hoarding policy did fire many workers taking advantage of the 2003 reform. This may indicate that the reform provided a good excuse to cut employment in firms that had been forced to comply with a labour hoarding policy even in an over-employment situation, which is more likely in sectors and countries where dismissals are rigorously regulated.",,"PAYROLL TAXES,WAGE,INSTITUTIONS,BONUS,EXPERIENCE,INEQUALITY,EMPLOYMENT,INCOME,BEARS,PAY","Kodama, Naomi@Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan@METI, Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, 11th Floor,1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan::Yokoyama, Izumi@Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan","Kodama, Naomi@Hitotsubashi University::Yokoyama, Izumi@Hitotsubashi University","Yokoyama, Izumi@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4661-2670","no title+Aaron,, H.

I discuss the practical (and testable) implications of these alternative assumptions, and show that weakening LI by LS might be empirically relevant.

"The Effects of Immigration on Household Services, Labour Supply and Fertility",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12225,AUG 2018,54,0,"Fertility and female labour force participation are no longer negatively correlated in developed countries. At the same time, increased immigration affects supply and prices of household services, which are relevant to fertility and employment decisions. This paper analyses the effect of immigration on labour supply and fertility of native women in the UK. Adopting an instrumental variable approach, I find that immigration increases female labour supply without affecting fertility. My results show that immigration increases the size of the childcare sector, and reduces its prices, suggesting that immigrants may ease the trade-off between working and child rearing among native women.",,"LOW-SKILLED IMMIGRATION,CHILD-CARE AVAILABILITY,DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES,FEMALE EMPLOYMENT,LOCATION CHOICES,MARRIED-WOMEN,IMPACT,DECISIONS,PARTICIPATION,INCENTIVES","Romiti, Agnese@IAB Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany","Romiti, Agnese@Unknow",not exist,"Changing fertility rates in developed countries.

Choosing Between Different Time-Varying Volatility Models for Structural Vector Autoregressive Analysis,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12238,AUG 2018,36,0,"The performance of information criteria and tests for residual heteroscedasticity for choosing between different models for time-varying volatility in the context of structural vector autoregressive analysis is investigated. Although it can be difficult to find the true volatility model with the selection criteria, using them is recommended because they can reduce the mean squared error of impulse response estimates substantially relative to a model that is chosen arbitrarily based on the personal preferences of a researcher. Heteroscedasticity tests are found to be useful tools for deciding whether time-varying volatility is present but do not discriminate well between different types of volatility changes.

Hodges-Lehmann Detection of Structural Shocks - An Analysis of Macroeconomic Dynamics in the Euro Area,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12234,AUG 2018,28,0,"Structural shocks in multivariate dynamic systems are hidden and often identified with reference to a priori economic reasoning. Based on a non-Gaussian framework of independent shocks, this work provides an approach to discriminate between alternative identifying assumptions on the basis of dependence diagnostics. Relying on principles of Hodges-Lehmann estimation, we suggest a decomposition of reduced form covariance matrices that yields implied least dependent (structural) shocks. A Monte Carlo study underlines the discriminatory strength of the proposed identification strategy.

On the Stability of Euro Area Money Demand and Its Implications for Monetary Policy,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12239,AUG 2018,69,0,"We employ a recent time-varying cointegration test to revisit the usefulness of long-run money demand equations for the ECB, addressing the issue of their instability by means of a model evaluation exercise. Building on the results, we make a twofold contribution. First, we propose a novel stable money demand equation relying on two crucial factors: a speculative motive, represented by domestic and foreign price-earnings ratios, and a precautionary motive, measured by changes in unemployment. Second, we use the model to derive relevant policy implications for the ECB, since excess liquidity looks more useful for forecasting stock market busts than future inflation. Overall, this evidence points to (i) a possible evolution of the monetary pillar in the direction of pursuing financial stability and (ii) the exclusion of a sudden liquidity-driven inflationary burst after the exit from the prolonged period of unconventional monetary measures.",,"TIME-VARYING COINTEGRATION,FINANCIAL STABILITY,BUSINESS-CYCLE,INFLATION,MODEL,COEFFICIENTS,INDICATORS,INFERENCE,VARIABLES,CREDIT","Barigozzi, Matteo@London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England::Conti, Antonio M.@Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Rome, Italy@Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium","Barigozzi, Matteo@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London::Conti, Antonio M.@Universite Libre de Bruxelles",not exist,"Quasi real time early warning indicators for costly asset price boom/bust cycles: A role for global liquidity+Alessi, Lucia; Detken, Carsten+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+SEP 2011::Money, financial stability and efficiency+Allen, Franklin; Carletti, Elena; Gale, Douglas+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY+JAN 2014::The Interaction between Capital Requirements and Monetary Policy+Angelini, Paolo; Neri, Stefano; Panetta, Fabio+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+SEP 2014::Guidances for National Authorities Operating the Counter-Cyclical Capital Buffer+no author+Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Working Paper No. 187+2010::Central bank misperceptions and the role of money in interest-rate rules+Beck, Guenter W.; Wieland, Volker+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+OCT 2008::International Evidence on Long-Run Money Demand+Benati,, L.; Lucas,, R.

Price Adjustment in Currency Unions: Another Dimension to the Endogeneity of the Optimum Currency Area Criteria?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12235,AUG 2018,18,0,"In a rational expectations model, wages and prices should respond more to shocks in currency unions than under adjustable pegs because of the absence of exchange rate adjustment. This is an aspect of the endogeneity of the optimum currency area criteria that has been largely ignored. Empirical evidence from three currency unions tends to suggest some degree of endogeneity of price flexibility, but the rate of adjustment is slow. Self-selection into currency unions by countries with naturally greater price flexibility does not appear to be a significant factor.",,"EURO AREA,CRISIS,MODEL","Bleaney, Michael@Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Yin, Lin@China Railway Party Sch, Econ Res Dept, Beijing, Peoples R China","Bleaney, Michael@University of Nottingham::Yin, Lin@Unknow",not exist,"RULES, DISCRETION AND REPUTATION IN A MODEL OF MONETARY-POLICY+BARRO, RJ; GORDON, DB+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+1983::Price Adjustment in Currency Unions+Bleaney,, M.

Deregulating Overtime Hours Restrictions on Women and its Effects on Female Employment: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Japan,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12221,AUG 2018,29,0,"This paper provides novel evidence on the effect of deregulating overtime hours restrictions on women by using the 1985 Amendments to the Labour Standards Act (LSA) in Japan as a natural experiment. The original LSA of 1947 prohibited women from working overtime exceeding two hours a day; six hours a week; and 150 hours a year. The 1985 Amendments exempted a variety of occupations and industries from such an overtime restriction on women. Applying a difference-in-difference model to census data, we find causal evidence pointing to the positive effect of this particular piece of labour market deregulation on the proportion of female employment. We then carry out a series of sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of our finding. Especially, we conduct a falsification test and an event study to show that our causal inference is not threatened by the differential pretreatment trends. Finally, we use quantile regressions and find that for jobs with more rapidly growing proportion of female employment, the effect of the exemption from the overtime work restriction on women is larger.",,"LABOR-MARKET INSTITUTIONS,AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION,MINIMUM-WAGES,WORK,LEGISLATION,IMPACT,LAW","Kato, Takao@Colgate Univ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA@IZA Bonn, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany@Rutgers State Univ, Sch Management & Labor Relat, 94 Rockafeller Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA@TCER Tokyo, Chiyoda Ku, Sankyo Main Bldg 703,1-7-10 Iidabashi, Tokyo 1020072, Japan@CJEB Columbia Business Sch, 2M9 Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA::Kodama, Naomi@Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan@METI, Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, 11th Floor,1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan","Kato, Takao@Rutgers State University New Brunswick@IZA Institute Labor Economics@Colgate University::Kodama, Naomi@Hitotsubashi University",not exist,"Equal Employment Opportunity Law and the gender wage gap in Japan: A cohort analysis+Abe, Yukiko+JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS+APR 2010::MINIMUM WAGES, LABOR MARKET INSTITUTIONS, AND FEMALE EMPLOYMENT: A CROSS-COUNTRY ANALYSIS+Addison, John T.; Ozturk, Orgul Demet+ILR REVIEW+OCT 2012::Parental leave reforms and the employment of new mothers: Quasi-experimental evidence from Japan+Asai, Yukiko+LABOUR ECONOMICS+OCT 2015::Outsourcing at will: The contribution of unjust dismissal doctrine to the growth of employment outsourcing+Autor, DH+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JAN 2003::Rat races and glass ceilings',+Bardsley,, P.; Sherstyuk,, K.+B.E.

Forecasting Macroeconomic Labour Market Flows: What Can We Learn from Micro-level Analysis?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12222,AUG 2018,26,0,"Forecasting labour market flows is important for budgeting and decision-making in government departments and public administration. Macroeconomic forecasts are normally obtained from time series data. In this article, we follow another approach that uses individual-level statistical analysis to predict the number of exits out of unemployment insurance claims. We present a comparative study of econometric, actuarial and statistical methodologies that base on different data structures. The results with records of the German unemployment insurance suggest that prediction based on individual-level statistical duration analysis constitutes an interesting alternative to aggregate data-based forecasting. In particular, forecasts of up to six months ahead are surprisingly precise and are found to be more precise than considered time series forecasts.",,"CHAIN-LADDER,UNEMPLOYMENT,INSURANCE,MODELS","Wilke, Ralf A.@Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark","Wilke, Ralf A.@Copenhagen Business School",not exist,"Micro-level stochastic loss reserving for general insurance+Antonio, Katrien; Plat, Richard+SCANDINAVIAN ACTUARIAL JOURNAL+2014::Bounds analysis of competing risks: a non-parametric evaluation of the effect of unemployment benefits on migration+Arntz, Melanie; Lo, Simon M.

Tests of Policy Interventions in DSGE Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12224,JUN 2018,20,0,"This paper considers tests of the effectiveness of a policy intervention, defined as a change in the parameters of a policy rule, in the context of a macroeconometric dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. We consider two types of intervention, first the standard case of a parameter change that does not alter the steady state, and second one that does alter the steady state, e.g. the target rate of inflation. We consider two types of test, one a multi-horizon test, where the postintervention policy horizon, H, is small and fixed, and a mean policy effect test where H is allowed to increase without bounds. The multi-horizon test requires Gaussian errors, but the mean policy effect test does not. It is shown that neither of these two tests are consistent, in the sense that the power of the tests does not tend to unity as H, unless the intervention alters the steady state. This follows directly from the fact that DSGE variables are measured as deviations from the steady state, and the effects of policy change on target variables decay exponentially fast. We investigate the size and power of the proposed mean effect test by simulating a standard three equation New Keynesian DSGE model. The simulation results are in line with our theoretical findings and show that in all applications the tests have the correct size; but unless the intervention alters the steady state, their power does not go to unity with H.",,MONETARY-POLICY,"Pesaran, M.

Multiple Testing for No Cointegration under Nonstationary Volatility,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12214,JUN 2018,68,0,"With cointegration tests often being oversized under time-varying error variance, it is possible, if not likely, to confuse error variance non-stationarity with cointegration. This paper takes an instrumental variable (IV) approach to establish individual-unit test statistics for no cointegration that are robust to variance non-stationarity. The sign of a fitted departure from long-run equilibrium is used as an instrument when estimating an error-correction model. The resulting IV-based test is shown to follow a chi-square limiting null distribution irrespective of the variance pattern of the data-generating process. In spite of this, the test proposed here has, unlike previous work relying on instrumental variables, competitive local power against sequences of local alternatives in 1/T-neighbourhoods of the null. The standard limiting null distribution motivates, using the single-unit tests in a multiple testing approach for cointegration in multi-country data sets by combining P-values from individual units. Simulations suggest good performance of the single-unit and multiple testing procedures under various plausible designs of cross-sectional correlation and cross-unit cointegration in the data. An application to the equilibrium relationship between short- and long-term interest rates illustrates the dramatic differences between results of robust and non-robust tests.",,"UNIT-ROOT TESTS,TERM STRUCTURE,PANEL COINTEGRATION,ERROR-CORRECTION,INTEREST-RATES,TIME-SERIES,EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS,BOOTSTRAP DETERMINATION,DEPENDENT PANELS,COMMON FACTORS","Demetrescu, Matei@Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, Olshausenstr 40-60, D-24118 Kiel, Germany::Hanck, Christoph@Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany","Demetrescu, Matei@University of Kiel::Hanck, Christoph@University of Duisburg Essen",not exist,"A panic attack on unit roots and cointegration+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2004::Testing panel cointegration with unobservable dynamic common factors that are correlated with the regressors+Bai, Jushan; Lluis Carrion-i-Silvestre, Josep+ECONOMETRICS JOURNAL+2013::Some cautions on the use of panel methods for integrated series of macroeconomic data+Banerjee, A.; Marcellino, M.; Osbat, C.+Econometrics Journal+2004::Testing for PPP: Should we use panel methods?+Banerjee, A; Marcellino, M; Osbat, C+EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS+MAY 2005::Error- correction mechanism tests for cointegration in a single- equation frame- work+Banerjee, A.; Dolado, J.

Confidence Sets for the Break Date in Cointegrating Regressions,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12223,JUN 2018,38,0,"In this paper, we propose constructing confidence sets for a break date in cointegrating regressions by inverting a test for the break location, which is obtained by maximizing the weighted average of power. It is found that the limiting distribution of the test depends on the number of I(1) regressors whose coefficients sustain structural change and the number of I(1) regressors whose coefficients are fixed throughout the sample. By Monte Carlo simulations, we then show that compared with a confidence interval developed by using the existing method based on the limiting distribution of the break point estimator under the assumption of the shrinking shift, the confidence set proposed in the present paper has a more accurate coverage rate, while the length of the confidence set is comparable. By using the method developed in this paper, we then investigate the cointegrating regressions of Russian macroeconomic variables with oil prices with a break.",,"MULTIPLE STRUCTURAL-CHANGES,OPTIMAL TESTS,CHANGE-POINT,TIME-SERIES,MODELS,LEADS,OIL,HYPOTHESIS,PARAMETER,SELECTION","Kurozumi, Eiji@Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan::Skrobotov, Anton@Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Inst Appl Econ Studies, Moscow, Russia@Innopolis Univ, Kazan, Russia","Kurozumi, Eiji@Hitotsubashi University::Skrobotov, Anton@Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration@Innopolis University",not exist,"Forecasting the Price of Oil+Alquist, Ron; Kilian, Lutz; Vigfusson, Robert J.+HANDBOOK OF ECONOMIC FORECASTING, VOL 2A+2013::OPTIMAL TESTS WHEN A NUISANCE PARAMETER IS PRESENT ONLY UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE+ANDREWS, DWK; PLOBERGER, W+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1994::TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::Testing for the null hypothesis of cointegration with a structural break+Arai, Yoichi; Kurozumi, Eiji+ECONOMETRIC REVIEWS+2007::Structural breaks in time series+Aue, Alexander; Horvath, Lajos+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+JAN 2013::Testing for and dating common breaks in multivariate time series+Bai, J; Lumsdaine, RL; Stock, JH+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1998::Estimation of a change point in multiple regression models+Bai, J+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1997::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::Cointegration tests in the presence of structural breaks+Campos, J; Ericsson, NR; Hendry, DF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 1996::Testing the null of cointegration with structural breaks+Carrion-I-Silvestre, Josep Lluis; Sanso, Andreu+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+OCT 2006::A comparison of alternative methods to construct confidence intervals for the estimate of a break date in linear regression models+Chang, Seong Yeon; Perron, Pierre+ECONOMETRIC REVIEWS+2018::Model selection criteria for the leads-and-lags cointegrating regression+Choi, In; Kurozumi, Eiji+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+AUG 2012::no title+Csorgo, M.; Horvath, L.+Limit Theorems in Change-Point Analysis+1997::Confidence sets for the date of a single break in linear time series regressions+Elliott, Graham; Mueller, Ulrich K.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 2007::Likelihood-ratio-based confidence sets for the timing of structural breaks+Eo, Yunjong; Morley, James+QUANTITATIVE ECONOMICS+JUL 2015::AN EMPIRICAL GROWTH MODEL FOR MAJOR OIL EXPORTERS+Esfahani, Hadi Salehi; Mohaddes, Kamiar; Pesaran, M.

Semiparametric Estimator for Binary-outcome Sample Selection: Prejudice Matters in Election,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12207,JUN 2018,55,0,"a semiparametric estimator for binary-outcome sample-selection models is proposed that imposes only single index assumptions on the selection and outcome equations without specifying the error term distribution. I adopt the idea in Lewbel (2000) using a special regressor' to transform the binary response Y so that the transformed Y becomes linear in the latent index, which then makes it possible to remove the selection correction term by differencing the transformed Y equation. There are various versions of the estimator, which perform differently trading off bias and variance. A simulation study is conducted, and then I apply the estimators to US presidential election data in 2008 and 2012 to assess the impact of racial prejudice on the elections, as a black candidate was involved for the first time ever in the US history.",,"DENSITY-WEIGHTED EXPECTATIONS,RANK CORRELATION ESTIMATOR,MODEL ESTIMATION,AVERSIVE RACISM,DISCRIMINATION,DECISIONS,OBAMA,BIAS,IDENTIFICATION,REGRESSION","Choi, Jin-Young@Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Econ & Business, Theodor W Adorno Pl 4, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany","Choi, Jin-Young@Goethe University Frankfurt",not exist,"SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF CENSORED SELECTION MODELS WITH A NONPARAMETRIC SELECTION MECHANISM+AHN, H; POWELL, JL+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1993::Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal?

Assessing the Empirical Relevance of Labour Frictions to Business Cycle Fluctuations,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12215,JUN 2018,47,0,"This paper describes a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model augmented with labour frictions, namely: indivisible labour, predetermined employment and adjustment costs. This improves the fit to the data as shown by a higher log marginal likelihood and closer match to key business cycle statistics. The labour frictions introduced are relevant for model dynamics and economic policy: the effect of total factor productivity shocks on most macroeconomic variables is substantially mitigated; fiscal policy leads to a greater crowding out of private sector activity and monetary policy has a lower impact on output. Labour frictions also provide a better match to impulse response functions from vector autoregressive models.",,"MONETARY-POLICY,TECHNOLOGY SHOCKS,KEYNESIAN MODEL,EQUILIBRIUM UNEMPLOYMENT,INFLATION DYNAMICS,SEARCH FRICTIONS,OVERTIME PAY,DSGE MODEL,MARKET,EMPLOYMENT","Madeira, Joao@Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Madeira, Joao@University of York - UK",not exist,"Unemployment and the business cycle+Alexopoulos, M+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAR 2004::Firm-Specific Capital, Nominal Rigidities and the Business Cycle+Altig,, D.; Christiano,, L.; Eichenbaum,, M.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Linde,, J</span>.+WORKING PAPER SERIES+2004::Labor Markets and Monetary Policy: A New Keynesian Model with Unemployment+Blanchard, Olivier; Gali, Jordi+AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-MACROECONOMICS+APR 2010::FISCAL EXPANSIONS, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION: THEORY AND EVIDENCE*+Brueckner, Markus; Pappa, Evi+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 2012::Non-stationary hours in a DSGE model+Chang, Yongsung; Doh, Taeyoung; Schorfheide, Frank+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+SEP 2007::Nominal rigidities and the dynamic effects of a shock to monetary policy+Christiano, LJ; Eichenbaum, M; Evans, CL+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+FEB 2005::Monetary policy rules and macroeconomic stability: Evidence and some theory+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2000::Fair wages in a New Keynesian model of the business cycle+Danthine, JP; Kurmann, A+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS+JAN 2004::The Labor Market in the Great Recession+Elsby,, M.; Hobijn,, B.; Sahin,, A.+NBER WORKING PAPERS+2010::Optimal monetary policy with staggered wage and price contracts+Erceg, CJ; Henderson, DW; Levin, AT+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+OCT 2000::Comparing dynamic equilibrium models to data: a Bayesian approach+Fernandez-Villaverde, J; Rubio-Ramirez, JF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2004::The Econometrics of DSGE Models+Fernandez-Villaverde, J.+NBER Working Papers 14677+2009::ROLE OF MONETARY POLICY+FRIEDMAN, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1968::Technology, employment, and the business cycle: Do technology shocks explain aggregate fluctuations?+Gali, J+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 1999::An Estimated Monetary DSGE Model with Unemployment and Staggered Nominal Wage Bargaining+Gertler, Mark; Sala, Luca; Trigari, Antonella+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+DEC 2008::Overtime, effort, and the propagation of business cycle shocks+Hall, GJ+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+AUG 1996::no title+Hamermesh, D.+Labor Demand+1993::Adjustment costs in factor demand+Hamermesh, DS; Pfann, GA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+SEP 1996::STRAIGHT TIME AND OVERTIME IN EQUILIBRIUM+HANSEN, GD; SARGENT, TJ+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAR-MAY 1988::News and Business Cycles in Open Economies+Jaimovich, Nir; Rebelo, Sergio+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+DEC 2008::BAYES FACTORS+KASS, RE; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::no title+Keynes, John Maynard.+The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money+1936::The quantitative analytics of the basic neomonetarist model+Kimball, MS+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+NOV 1995::Resuscitating Real Business Cycles+King,, R.; Rebelo,, S.+RCER WORKING PAPERS+2000::Do search frictions matter for inflation dynamics?+Krause, Michael U.; Lopez-Salido, David J.; Lubik, Thomas A.+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 2008::The (ir)relevance of real wage rigidity in the New Keynesian model with search frictions+Krause, Michael U.; Lubik, Thomas A.+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+APR 2007::Estimating a Search and Matching Model of Aggregate Labor Market+Lubik, T.

The empirical findings provide evidence for differences in the transmission of monetary policy shocks that mainly stem from heterogeneity in the responses of financial market quantities.",,"STRUCTURAL VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIONS,VARIABLE SELECTION,SIGN RESTRICTIONS,TURNING-POINTS,TIME-SERIES,TRANSMISSION,SHOCKS,IDENTIFICATION,FLUCTUATIONS,SHRINKAGE","Huber, Florian@Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria::Fischer, Manfred M.@Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria","Huber, Florian@Vienna University of Economics & Business::Fischer, Manfred M.@Vienna University of Economics & Business","Huber, Florian@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2896-7921","Sign Restrictions in Bayesian FAVARs with An Application to Monetary Policy Shocks+Ahmadi,, P.

Consequences of Linguistic Distance for Economic Growth,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12205,JUN 2018,38,0,"This paper advances a new country-level measure of ethno-linguistic diversity, making use of Greenberg's definition of diversity by synthesizing information on the share of different ethno-linguistic groups in a country's population and, more importantly, information on intergroup linguistic distances derived from a recently developed lexicostatistical approach. I show that this measure captures ethno-linguistic diversity at lower levels of linguistic aggregation. However, unlike the commonly used phylogenetic language tree approach, I found that these distance-weighted diversity measures continue to have a strong negative statistical association with economic growth that is not sensitive to the underlying resemblance function between ethno-linguistic groups.",,"ETHNIC DIVERSITY,LANGUAGE,CLASSIFICATION,WORLD","Goeren, Erkan@Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Econ, Sch Comp Sci Business Adm Econ & Law Fac 2, Bldg A5, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany","Goeren, Erkan@Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg",not exist,"The Role of Language in Shaping International Migration+Adsera, Alicia; Pytlikova, Mariola+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+AUG 2015::Fractionalization+Alesina, A; Devleeschauwer, A; Easterly, W; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH+JUN 2003::Ethnic diversity and economic performance+Alesina, A; La Ferrara, E+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE+SEP 2005::no title+[Anonymous].+CHIC ILL+2015::Adding typology to lexicostatistics: A combined approach to language classification+Bakker, Dik; Miller, Andre; Velupillai, Viveka<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Wichmann, Soren; Brown, Cecil H.; Brown, Pamela; Egorov, Dmitry; Mailhammer, Robert; Grant, Anthony; Holman, Eric W</span>.+Linguistic Typology+2009::no title+Banks, Aurthur.+Cross-national Time-series Data Archive+2011::A new data set of educational attainment in the world, 1950-2010+Barro, Robert J.; Lee, Jong Wha+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+SEP 2013::A Generalized Index of Fractionalization+Bossert, Walter; D'Ambrosio, Conchita; La Ferrara, Eliana+ECONOMICA+OCT 2011::Automatic classification of the world's languages: a description of the method and preliminary results+Brown, C.; Holman, E.; Wichmann, S.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Velupillai, V</span>.+Lang.

Migrant Networks and the Spread of Information,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12216,JUN 2018,65,0,"Diaspora networks provide information to future migrants, which affects their success in the host country. While the existing literature explains the effect of networks on the outcomes of migrants through the size of the migrant community, we show that the quality of the network is an equally important determinant. We argue that networks that are more integrated in the society of the host country can provide more accurate information to future migrants about job prospects. In a decision model with imperfect signalling, we show that migrants with access to a better network are more likely to make the right decision, that is, they migrate only if they gain. We test these predictions empirically using data on recent Mexican migrants to the United States. To instrument for the quality of networks, we exploit the settlement of immigrants who came during the Bracero program in the 1950s. The results are consistent with the model predictions, providing evidence that connections to a better integrated network lead to better outcomes after migration.",,"MEXICO-US MIGRATION,SOCIAL NETWORKS,SELF-SELECTION,UNITED-STATES,INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION,WEAK INSTRUMENTS,ETHNIC ENCLAVES,FOREIGN-BORN,LABOR-MARKET,IMMIGRANTS","Elsner, Benjamin@Inst Lab Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany::Narciso, Gaia@Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland::Thijssen, Jacco@Univ York, York Management Sch, York, N Yorkshire, England","Elsner, Benjamin@IZA Institute Labor Economics::Narciso, Gaia@Trinity College Dublin::Thijssen, Jacco@University of York - UK",not exist,"Spread of (mis)information in social networks+Acemoglu, Daron; Ozdaglar, Asuman; ParandehGheibi, Ali+GAMES AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR+NOV 2010::Bayesian Learning in Social Networks+Acemoglu, Daron; Dahleh, Munther A.; Lobel, Ilan; et al.+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+OCT 2011::The Determinants and the Selection of Mexico-US Migrants+Ambrosini, J.

Young Adults Living with their Parents and the Influence of Peers,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12198,JUN 2018,65,0,"This study examines the impact of peer behaviour on the living arrangements of young adults in the US using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. We achieve identification by exploiting the differences in the timing of leaving the parental home among peers, the individual-specific nature of the peer groups that are based on friendship nominations, and by including network and cohort fixed effects. Our results indicate that there are statistically significant peer effects on young adults' decisions to leave the parental home.

Biases and Strategic Behaviour in Performance Evaluation: The Case of the FIFA's best soccer player award,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12201,APR 2018,41,0,"In this paper, we study biases in performance evaluation by analysing votes for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award for best soccer player, the most prestigious award in the sport. Our findings suggest that similarity' biases are substantial, with jury members disproportionately voting for candidates from their own country, own national team, own continent and own league team. Further, we show that the impact of such biases on the total number of votes a candidate receives is fairly limited and hence is likely to affect the outcome of this competition only on rare occasions where the difference in quality between the leading candidates is small. Finally, analysing the incidence of strategic voting', we find jury members who vote for one leading candidate are more, rather than less, likely to also give points to his main competitor, as compared with neutral jury members. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of awards, elections and performance evaluation systems in general and for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award in particular.",,"SIMILARITY,ATTRACTION,INCENTIVES,ELECTIONS,AWARDS,FIRMS","Coupe, Tom@Kyiv Sch Econ, Kiev, Ukraine@Univ Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand::Gergaud, Olivier@KEDGE Business Sch, Talence, France@Sci Po, LIEPP, Paris, France::Noury, Abdul@New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Coupe, Tom@Kyiv School of Economics@University of Canterbury::Gergaud, Olivier@Kedge Business School@Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (SciencePo)@Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite-USPC (ComUE)::Noury, Abdul@Unknow",not exist,"Strategic voting in British elections+Alvarez, RM; Boehmke, FJ; Nagler, J+ELECTORAL STUDIES+MAR 2006::Per ongeluk Ongeldig Gestemd+[Anonymous].+Volkskrant+2011::Awards unbundled: Evidence from a natural field experiment+Ashraf, Nava; Bandiera, Oriana; Lee, Scott S.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR &amp; ORGANIZATION+APR 2014::FACIAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN VOTERS AND CANDIDATES CAUSES INFLUENCE+Bailenson, Jeremy N.; Iyengar, Shanto; Yee, Nick; et al.+PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY+2008::Voting systems and strategic manipulation: An experimental study+Bassi, Anna+JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL POLITICS+JAN 2015::no title+BEBCHUK, LUCIAN; FRIED, JESSE.+PAY WITHOUT PERFORMANCE: THE UNFULFILLED PROMISE OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION+2004::The Looks of a Winner: Beauty, Gender and Electoral Success+Berggren,, N.; Jordahl,, H.; Poutvaara,, P.+IZA Discussion Paper No. 2311+2006::Are CEOs rewarded for luck?

To Pool or Not to Pool: Revisited,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12220,APR 2018,10,0,"This paper provides a new comparative analysis of pooled least squares and fixed effects (FE) estimators of the slope coefficients in the case of panel data models when the time dimension (T) is fixed while the cross section dimension (N) is allowed to increase without bounds. The individual effects are allowed to be correlated with the regressors, and the comparison is carried out in terms of an exponent coefficient, , which measures the degree of pervasiveness of the FE in the panel. The use of allows us to distinguish between poolability of small N dimensional panels with large T from large N dimensional panels with small T. It is shown that the pooled estimator remains consistent so long as delta<1, and is asymptotically normally distributed if delta <1/2, for a fixed T and as N. It is further shown that when delta<1/2, the pooled estimator is more efficient than the FE estimator. We also propose a Hausman type diagnostic test of delta<1/2 as a simple test of poolability, and propose a pretest estimator that could be used in practice. Monte Carlo evidence supports the main theoretical findings and gives some indications of gains to be made from pooling when delta <1/2.",,PANEL-DATA,"Pesaran, M.

"TIPS and the VIX: Spillovers from Financial Panic to Breakeven Inflation in an Automated, Nonlinear Modeling Framework",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12218,APR 2018,40,0,"This paper examines the determinants of the breakeven inflation rate (BEI) on U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities. After controlling for several measures of liquidity, inflation expectations and inflation uncertainty; financial fear itself (proxied with the Volatility Index or VIX) remains a primary influence on BEI. To delve into the mechanism underlying this association, the VIX is decomposed, using intraday data, into conditional variance and the variance premium capturing risk aversion. Aside from the 2008 crisis, most of the effect emanated from the variance premium. Following the crisis, indicators of bank insolvency risk gain prominence as well. Lastly, an automated nonlinear model finds convex effects of variance, and diminishing returns to insolvency risk and liquidity.",,"BANK INSOLVENCY RISK,REAL INTEREST-RATES,Z-SCORE MEASURES,PREMIA,EXPECTATIONS,UNCERTAINTY,VOLATILITY,SELECTION,VARIANCE,PRICES","Stillwagon, Josh R.@Babson Coll, Econ Div, Inst New Econ Thinking, Program Imperfect Knowledge Econ IKE, Westgate Hall 313,231 Forest St, Babson Pk, MA 02457 USA","Stillwagon, Josh R.@Babson College",not exist,"The Term Structure of Inflation Expectations+Adrian,, T.; Wu,, H.

Data-Driven Identification Constraints for DSGE Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12217,APR 2018,28,0,"We propose imposing data-driven identification constraints to alleviate the multimodality problem arising in the estimation of poorly identified dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models under non-informative prior distributions. We also devise an iterative procedure based on the posterior density of the parameters for finding these constraints. An empirical application to the Smets and Wouters () model demonstrates the properties of the estimation method, and shows how the problem of multimodal posterior distributions caused by parameter redundancy is eliminated by identification constraints. Out-of-sample forecast comparisons as well as Bayes factors lend support to the constrained model.",,"MONTE-CARLO METHODS,SCORING RULES,PREDICTION,SIMULATION,INFERENCE,POSTERIOR","Lanne, Markku@Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland::Luoto, Jani@Unknow","Lanne, Markku@University of Helsinki::Luoto, Jani@Unknow","Lanne, Markku@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9397-2578","Forecasting performance of an open economy DSGE model+Adolfson, Malin; Linde, Jesper; Villani, Mattias+ECONOMETRIC REVIEWS+2007::Adaptive importance sampling in general mixture classes+Cappe, Olivier; Douc, Randal; Guillin, Arnaud; et al.+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+DEC 2008::Tailored randomized block MCMC methods with application to DSGE models+Chib, Siddhartha; Ramamurthy, Srikanth+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR 2010::Central limit theorem for sequential Monte Carlo methods and its application to bayesian inference+Chopin, N+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2004::no title+Creal, D.+Sequential Monte Carlo samplers for Bayesian DSGE models.+2007::Sequential Monte Carlo samplers+Del Moral, P; Doucet, A; Jasra, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::On adaptive resampling strategies for sequential Monte Carlo methods+Del Moral, Pierre; Doucet, Arnaud; Jasra, Ajay+BERNOULLI+FEB 2012::DSGE Model-Based Forecasting+Del Negro, Marco; Schorfheide, Frank+HANDBOOK OF ECONOMIC FORECASTING, VOL 2A+2013::ADAPTIVE SEQUENTIAL POSTERIOR SIMULATORS FOR MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS+Durham, Garland; Geweke, John+BAYESIAN MODEL COMPARISON+2014::no title+Everitt, B.

Nowcasting Indian GDP,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12219,APR 2018,34,0,"Nowcasting has become a useful tool for making timely predictions of gross domestic product (GDP) in a data-rich environment. However, in developing economies this is more challenging due to substantial revisions in GDP data and the limited availability of predictor variables. Taking India as a leading case, we use a dynamic factor model nowcasting method to analyse these two issues. Firstly, we propose to compare nowcasts of the first release of GDP to those of the final release to assess differences in their predictability. Secondly, we expand a standard set of predictors typically used for nowcasting GDP with nominal and international series, in order to proxy the variation in missing employment and service sector variables in India. We find that the factor model improves over several benchmarks, including bridge equations, but only for the final GDP release and not for the first release. Also, the nominal and international series improve predictions over and above real series. This suggests that future studies of nowcasting in developing economies which have similar issues of data revisions and availability as India should be careful in analysing first- vs. final-release GDP data, and may find that predictions are improved when additional variables from more timely international data sources are included.",,"DYNAMIC FACTOR MODELS,REAL-TIME,MONETARY-POLICY,BUSINESS-CYCLE,FORECASTS","Bragoli, Daniela@Univ Cattolica, Dept Math Financial Math & Econometr, Via Necchi 9, I-29100 Milan, Italy::Fosten, Jack@Univ East Anglia, Dept Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Bragoli, Daniela@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart::Fosten, Jack@University of East Anglia",not exist,"Data revisions are not well behaved+Aruoba, S.

Multiple Visits and Data Quality in Household Surveys,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12196,APR 2018,37,0,"In order to increase data quality some household surveys visit the respondent households several times to estimate one measure of consumption. For example, in Ghanaian Living Standards Measurement surveys, households are visited up to 10 times over a period of 1 month. I find strong evidence for conditioning effects as a result of this approach: In the Ghanaian data the estimated level of consumption is a function of the number of prior visits, with consumption being highest in the earlier survey visits. Telescoping (perceiving events as being more recent than they are) or seasonality (first-of-the-month effects) cannot explain the observed pattern. To study whether earlier or later survey visits are of higher quality, I employ a strategy based on Benford's law. Results suggest that the consumption data from earlier survey visits are of higher quality than data from later visits. The findings have implications for the value of additional visits in household surveys, and also shed light on possible measurement problems in high-frequency panels.

Mergers Along the Global Supply Chain: Information Technologies and Routine Tasks,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12165,APR 2018,57,0,"This paper empirically analyses how the adoption of Information Technologies (IT) has changed the organization of global supply chains. We focus on international mergers, which are a growing and important component of foreign direct investment. We use data on North-South mergers and acquisitions (M&As). We show that the effect of IT adoption on the number of vertical M&As is decreasing with the routine intensity of the industry. Our interpretation is that the IT revolution enabled new monitoring mechanisms. This allowed Northern headquarters to better monitor suppliers, especially those in less routine-intensive industries -which were harder to monitor before.",,"FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT,IMPERFECT CAPITAL-MARKETS,INTERNATIONAL-TRADE,INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS,PROPERTY-RIGHTS,FIRMS,ACQUISITIONS,OWNERSHIP,FLOWS,ORGANIZATION","Basco, Sergi@Univ Carlos III, Getafe, Spain::Mestieri, Marti@Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA","Basco, Sergi@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Mestieri, Marti@Northwestern University",not exist,"Unbundling institutions+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 2005::Intra-Industry Foreign Direct Investment+Alfaro, Laura; Charlton, Andrew+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2009::Fixed effects negative binomial regression models+Allison, P.

Solving Models with Jump Discontinuities in Policy Functions,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12203,APR 2018,38,0,"We compare global methods for solving models with jump discontinuities in the policy function. We find that differences between value function iteration (VFI) and other methods are economically significant and Euler equation errors fail to be a sufficient measure of accuracy in such models. VFI fails to accurately identify both the location and size of jump discontinuities, while the endogenous grid method (EGM) and the finite element method (FEM) are much better at approximating this class of models. We further show that combining VFI with a local interpolation step (VFI-INT) is sufficient to obtain accurate approximations. The combination of computational speed, relatively easy implementation and adaptability make VFI-INT especially suitable for approximating models with jump discontinuities in policy functions: while EGM is the fastest method, it is relatively complex to implement; implementation of VFI-INT is relatively straightforward and it is much faster than FEM.",,"AGGREGATE INVESTMENT DYNAMICS,ENDOGENOUS GRID METHOD,BUSINESS-CYCLE,DEFAULT RISK,TECHNOLOGY,ADJUSTMENT,NONCONVEXITIES,FLUCTUATIONS,ECONOMIES,GROWTH","Gortz, Christoph@Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England::Mirza, Afrasiab@Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Gortz, Christoph@University of Birmingham::Mirza, Afrasiab@University of Birmingham",not exist,"Balladurette and Juppette: A discrete analysis of scrapping subsidies+Adda, J; Cooper, R+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+AUG 2000::Default risk and income fluctuations in emerging economies+Arellano, Cristina+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2008::Envelope condition method with an application to default risk models+Arellano, Cristina; Maliar, Lilia; Maliar, Serguei; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+AUG 2016::Default and the Maturity Structure in Sovereign Bonds+Arellano, Cristina; Ramanarayanan, Ananth+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+APR 2012::Comparing solution methods for dynamic equilibrium economies+Aruoba, S.

Virtually No Effect? Different Uses of Classroom Computers and their Effect on Student Achievement,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12192,FEB 2018,0,0,"Most studies find little to no effect of classroom computers on student achievement. We suggest that this null effect may combine positive effects of computer uses without equivalently effective alternative traditional teaching practices and negative effects of uses that substitute more effective teaching practices. Our correlated random effects models exploit within-student between-subject variation in different computer uses in the international TIMSS test. We find positive effects of using computers to look up information and negative effects of using computers to practice skills, resulting in overall null effects. Effects are larger for students with high socioeconomic status and mostly confined to developed countries.",,,"Falck, Oliver@Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany::Mang, Constantin@Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany::Woessmann, Ludger@Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany","Falck, Oliver@Ifo Institut@University of Munich::Mang, Constantin@Ifo Institut@University of Munich::Woessmann, Ludger@Ifo Institut@University of Munich",not exist,
Macroeconomic Forecasting using Low-frequency Filters,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12194,FEB 2018,0,0,"We consider univariate low-frequency filters applicable in real-time as a macroeconomic forecasting method. This amounts to targeting only low frequency fluctuations of the time series of interest. We show through simulations that such approach is warranted and, using USdata, we confirmempirically that consistent gains in forecast accuracy can be obtained in comparison with a variety of other methods. There is an inherent arbitrariness in the choice of the cut-off defining low and high frequencies, which calls for a careful characterization of the implied optimal (for forecasting) degree of smoothing of the key macroeconomic indicatorswe analyse. We document interesting patterns that emerge: for most variables the optimal choice amounts to disregarding fluctuationswell belowthe standard business cycle cut-off of 32 quarters while generally increasing with the forecast horizon; for inflation and variables related to housing this cut-off lies around 32 quarters for all horizons, which is below the optimal level for federal government spending.",,,"Valle e Azevedo, Joao@Banco Portugal, Ave Almirante Reis 71,6th Floor, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal@Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal::Pereira, Ana@Banco Portugal, Ave Almirante Reis 71,6th Floor, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal@Inst Super Econ & Gestao, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal","Valle e Azevedo, Joao@Banco de Portugal@Universidade Nova de Lisboa::Pereira, Ana@Universidade de Lisboa@Banco de Portugal","Valle e Azevedo, Joao@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3538-3860",
Co-integration Rank Determination in Partial Systems Using Information Criteria,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12195,FEB 2018,48,0,"We investigate the asymptotic and finite sample properties of the most widely used information criteria for co-integration rank determination in ` partial' systems, i. e. in co-integrated vector autoregressive (VAR) models where a sub-set of variables of interest is modelled conditional on another sub-set of variables. The asymptotic properties of the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Hannan-Quinn information criterion (HQC) are established, and consistency of BIC and HQC is proved. Notably, the consistency of BIC and HQC is robust to violations of weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables with respect to the co-integration parameters. More precisely, BIC and HQC recover the true co-integration rank from the partial system analysis also when the conditional model does not convey all information about the co-integration parameters. This result opens up interesting possibilities for practitioners who can now determine the co-integration rank in partial systems without being concerned about the weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables. A Monte Carlo experiment based on a large dimensional data generating process shows that BIC and HQC applied in partial systems performreasonably well in small samples and comparatively better than ` traditional'methods for co-integration rank determination. We further show the usefulness of our approach and the benefits of the conditional system analysis in two empirical illustrations, both based on the estimation of VAR systems on US quarterly data. Overall, our analysis shows the gains of combining information criteria with partial system analysis.",,"STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT,BROAD-BAND,PUBLIC-SCHOOLS,INTERNET,INSTRUCTION,COMPUTERS,IMPACT,TECHNOLOGY,EDUCATION,TEACHERS","Cavaliere, Giuseppe@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40124 Bologna, Italy::De Angelis, Luca@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40124 Bologna, Italy::Fanelli, Luca@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40124 Bologna, Italy","Cavaliere, Giuseppe@University of Bologna::De Angelis, Luca@University of Bologna::Fanelli, Luca@University of Bologna",not exist,"ACCOUNTABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS: EVIDENCE FROM BOSTON'S CHARTERS AND PILOTS+Abdulkadiroglu, Atila; Angrist, Joshua D.; Dynarski, Susan M.; et al.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 2011::New Evidence on Class Size Effects: A Pupil Fixed Effects Approach+Altinok, Nadir; Kingdon, Geeta+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+APR 2012::New evidence on classroom computers and pupil learning+Angrist, J; Lavy, V+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+OCT 2002::Estimates of the returns to schooling from sibling data: Fathers, sons, and brothers+Ashenfelter, O; Zimmerman, DJ+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1997::The skill content of recent technological change: An empirical exploration+Autor, DH; Levy, F; Murnane, RJ+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2003::Remedying education: Evidence from two randomized experiments in India+Banerjee, Abhijit V.; Cole, Shawn; Duflo, Esther; et al.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 2007::The use and misuse of computers in education: evidence from a randomized experiment in Colombia+Barrera-Osorio, F; Linden, L.L.+Policy Research Working Paper, 4836+2009::Technology's Edge: The Educational Benefits of Computer-Aided Instruction+Barrow, Lisa; Markman, Lisa; Rouse, Cecilia Elena+AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-ECONOMIC POLICY+FEB 2009::Surfing alone?

Bayesian Inference in Spatial Sample Selection Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12187,FEB 2018,29,0,"In this study, we consider Bayesian methods for the estimation of a sample selection model with spatially correlated disturbance terms. We design a set of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms based on the method of data augmentation. The natural parameterization for the covariance structure of our model involves an unidentified parameter that complicates posterior analysis. The unidentified parameter - the variance of the disturbance term in the selection equation - is handled in different ways in these algorithms to achieve identification for other parameters. The Bayesian estimator based on these algorithms can account for the selection bias and the full covariance structure implied by the spatial correlation. We illustrate the implementation of these algorithms through a simulation study and an empirical application.",,"TIME-SERIES,REAL-TIME,INFORMATIONAL CONTENT,OUTPUT GROWTH,UNITED-STATES,FORECASTS,CYCLES","Dogan, Osman@Univ Illinois, Econ Program, Chicago, IL 60680 USA::Taspinar, Suleyman@CUNY, Queens Coll, Econ Program, New York, NY 10021 USA","Dogan, Osman@University of Illinois Chicago Hospital@University of Illinois Chicago@University of Illinois System::Taspinar, Suleyman@Queens College NY (CUNY)@City University of New York (CUNY) System",not exist,"NEW EUROCOIN: TRACKING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN REAL TIME+Altissimo, Filippo; Cristadoro, Riccardo; Forni, Mario; et al.+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 2010::Forecasting with Mixed-Frequency Data+Andreou, E.; Ghysels, E.; Kourtellos, A.+OXFORD HDB EC FORECA+2011::Do macro variables, asset markets, or surveys forecast inflation better?+Ang, Andrew; Bekaert, Geert; Wei, Min+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 2007::COMBINATION OF FORECASTS+BATES, JM; GRANGER, CWJ+OPERATIONAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY+1969::Measuring business cycles: Approximate band-pass filters for economic time series+Baxter, M; King, RG+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1999::Measuring the effects of monetary policy: A factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) approach+Bernanke, BS; Boivin, J; Eliasz, P+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2005::The band pass filter+Christiano, LJ; Fitzgerald, TJ+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2003::Pooling of forecasts+Clements, M.; Hendry, D.+Econometrics Journal+2004::no title+Clements, M.; Hendry, D.

Key to our approach is the vector moving average representation of the half-vectorized 'squared' multivariate GARCH process of the popular BEKK model. In an empirical application to a four-dimensional system of broad asset classes (equity, fixed income, foreign exchange and commodities), we illustrate the new spillover indices at various levels of (dis) aggregation.

In this paper, we see what the frequency implies for the behaviour of price-setters in terms of the cross-sectional distribution average of price-spell durations across firms. We derive a lower bound for the mean duration of price-spells averaged across firms. We use the UK CPI data at the aggregate and sectoral level and find that the actual mean is about twice the theoretical minimum consistent with the observed frequency. We construct hypothetical Bernoulli-Calvo distributions from the frequency data which we find can result in similar impulse responses to the estimated hazards when used in the Smets-Wouters (2003) model.",,"INFLATION PERSISTENCE,SETTING BEHAVIOR,BUSINESS-CYCLE,MICRO-EVIDENCE,STICKY PRICES,RIGIDITY,MODELS,CONTRACTS,TAYLOR,WAGE","Dixon, Huw David@Cardiff Business Sch, Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales::Tian, Kun@Univ Xiangtan, Xiangtan, Peoples R China@Cardiff Univ, Ctr Price & Inflat, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales","Dixon, Huw David@Cardiff University::Tian, Kun@Xiangtan University@Cardiff University",not exist,"PRICE SETTING WITH MENU COST FOR MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS+Alvarez, Fernando;

Bargaining and Wage Rigidity in a Matching Model for the US,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12186,DEC 2017,43,0,"This paper uses robust econometric methods to assess previous empirical results for the Mortensen and Pissarides () matching model. Assuming all wages are negotiated each period is inconsistent with the history dependence in US wages, even allowing for heterogeneous match productivities, time to build vacancies and credible bargaining. Flexible wages for job changers, with rigid wages for job stayers, allows the model to capture this history dependence and is not inconsistent with parameter calibrations in the literature. Such wage rigidity affects only the timing of wage payments over the duration of matches; conclusions about other characteristics are unaffected by it.",,"STRUCTURAL ECONOMETRIC-ANALYSIS,EQUILIBRIUM UNEMPLOYMENT,INFLATION DYNAMICS,BUSINESS-CYCLE,LABOR-MARKET,WEAK IDENTIFICATION,GENERALIZED-METHOD,CYCLICAL BEHAVIOR,SAMPLE PROPERTIES,SEARCH FRICTIONS","Malcomson, James M.@Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England::Mavroeidis, Sophocles@Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England@Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England","Malcomson, James M.@University of Oxford::Mavroeidis, Sophocles@University of Oxford",not exist,"Testing with many weak instruments+Andrews, Donald W.

The returns are substantial and differ considerably by gender. The results imply that the unequal valuation of volunteer experience by gender is more important in explaining the gender earnings gap than is the unequal valuation of part-time paid work experience. The results also indicate negative selection into unpaid work. In a simple model of optimal volunteering, negative selection implies that a lower cost of volunteering would produce both an expanded and higher-skilled pool of volunteers, and greater societal benefits from volunteer work.",,"INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES,MARKET,INCOME,DISCRIMINATION,CONFLICT,RAINFALL,WOMEN","Cozzi, Guido@Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ, St Gallen, Switzerland::Mantovan, Noemi@Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales::Sauer, Robert M.@Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England","Cozzi, Guido@University of St Gallen::Mantovan, Noemi@Bangor University::Sauer, Robert M.@Royal Holloway University London@University of London",not exist,"IMPURE ALTRUISM AND DONATIONS TO PUBLIC-GOODS - A THEORY OF WARM-GLOW GIVING+ANDREONI, J+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JUN 1990::Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::The interpretation of instrumental variables estimators in simultaneous equations models with an application to the demand for fish+Angrist, JD; Graddy, K; Imbens, GW+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 2000::Charitable giving, income, and taxes: An analysis of panel data+Auten, GE; Sieg, H; Clotfelter, CT+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 2002::""The Big Society,"" Public Expenditure, and Volunteering+Bartels, Koen P.

Low Wage Returns to Schooling in a Developing Country: Evidence from a Major Policy Reform in Turkey,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12174,DEC 2017,42,1,"In this paper, we estimate returns to schooling for young men and women in Turkey using the exogenous and substantial variation in schooling across birth cohorts brought about by the 1997 reform of compulsory schooling within a fuzzy regression discontinuity design. We estimate that the return from an extra year of schooling is about 7-8% for women and an imprecisely estimated 2-2.5% for men. The low level of the estimates for men contrasts starkly with those estimated for other developing countries. We identify several reasons why returns to schooling are low for men and why they are higher for women in our context. In particular, the policy alters the schooling distributions of men and women differently, thus the average causal effect puts a higher weight on the causal effect of schooling at higher grade levels for women than for men.",,"REGRESSION-DISCONTINUITY DESIGN,EDUCATION,INSTRUMENTS,IDENTIFICATION,COLLEGE,AVERAGE,WEAK","Aydemir, Abdurrahman@Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Orhanli, Tuzla, Turkey::Kirdar, Murat G.@Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey","Aydemir, Abdurrahman@Sabanci University::Kirdar, Murat G.@Bogazici University",not exist,"How large are human-capital externalities?

"Is the Quarter of Birth Endogenous? New Evidence from Taiwan, the US, and Indonesia",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12175,DEC 2017,33,0,"Recent evidence based on US data suggests that the quarter or month of birth (QOB or MOB) may be endogenous, since family characteristics can explain up to 50% of the effects of QOB on the education outcomes and earnings of adult males. In this study, based on a sample of one million Taiwanese siblings, we examine university admission at age 18 as our outcome variable and find that at school entry, the oldest (September born) children are 31-38% more likely to be admitted into university at age 18 than the youngest (August born) children, indicating strong seasonality in university admission. The inclusion of controls for family background is found to explain only a small portion of these effects, particularly for males. Given that such results are at odds with the recent US evidence, we revisit the US Census data and find that when racial differences are properly controlled for in the estimation, even a rich set of family characteristics is capable of explaining only a minor proportion of the QOB effects. Furthermore, using data from the US and Indonesia, we find that seasonal temperature variation is unlikely to be an important contributor to the US-Taiwan disparity. Our findings imply that the validity of using QOB or MOB as an instrumental variable may be dependent on the population being studied and the sample selected.",,"SCHOOL-ENTRY,INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES,EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT,AGE,OUTCOMES,EARNINGS,POLICIES,RETURNS","Fan, Elliott@Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan::Liu, Jin-Tan@Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan::Chen, Yen-Chien@Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou, Taiwan","Fan, Elliott@National Taiwan University::Liu, Jin-Tan@National Taiwan University::Chen, Yen-Chien@National Chi Nan University",not exist,"THE EFFECT OF AGE AT SCHOOL ENTRY ON EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT - AN APPLICATION OF INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES WITH MOMENTS FROM 2 SAMPLES+ANGRIST, JD; KRUEGER, AB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::DOES COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AFFECT SCHOOLING AND EARNINGS+ANGRIST, JD; KRUEGER, AB+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 1991::Using Unemployment Rates as Instruments to Estimate Returns to Schooling+Arkes, Jeremy+SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JAN 2010::School Entry, Educational Attainment, and Quarter of Birth: A Cautionary Tale of a Local Average Treatment Effect+Barua, Rashmi; Lang, Kevin+JOURNAL OF HUMAN CAPITAL+FAL 2016::School-Entry Policies and Skill Accumulation Across Directly and Indirectly Affected Individuals+Bedard, Kelly; Dhuey, Elizabeth+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SUM 2012::The persistence of early childhood maturity: International evidence of long-run age effects+Bedard, Kelly; Dhuey, Elizabeth+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2006::TOO YOUNG TO LEAVE THE NEST?

Inflation Target Credibility: Do the Financial Markets Find the Targets Believable?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12181,DEC 2017,24,1,"We investigate the credibility of inflation targeting (IT) central banks (CBs) by estimating perceived inflation targets of the financial markets. We calculate financial markets' beliefs about the inflation targets of 24 IT countries. Then, we analyse whether the financial markets' beliefs about inflation targets match the announced targets. We conclude that the perceived upper bound of the inflation target is significantly higher than the announced one in many countries. Additionally, the perceived target band is narrower and asymmetric around the mid-point of the target for most CBs. We examine the implications of these findings and find that IT CBs are more likely to miss their targets when the perceptions of the financial markets are higher than the announced IT targets. These results indicate that IT CBs should pay attention to the perceptions of the announced targets when implementing policy actions.",,,"Tas, Bedri Kamil Onur@TOBB ETU, Dept Econ, Sogutozu Cad 43, Ankara, Turkey::Peker, Mustafa Cagri@Energy Market Regulatory Board, Ankara, Turkey","Tas, Bedri Kamil Onur@TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University::Peker, Mustafa Cagri@Unknow",not exist,"Hedging inflation with individual US stocks: A long-run portfolio analysis+Bampinas, Georgios; Panagiotidis, Theodore+NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE+JUL 2016::Under What Conditions Can Inflation Targeting Be Adopted?

On the Identification of Interdependence and Contagion of Financial Crises,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12188,DEC 2017,45,0,"In this paper we propose a new framework for modelling heteroskedastic structural vector autoregressions. The identification of the structural parameters is obtained by exploiting the heteroskedasticity in the data naturally arising during crisis periods. More precisely, we provide identification conditions when heteroskedasticity and traditional restrictions on the parameters are jointly considered. Although the framework is general enough to find potential applications in many empirical economic fields, it proves to be well suited for distinguishing between interdependence and contagion in the literature related to the transmission of financial crises. This methodology is used to investigate the relationships between sovereign bond yields for some highly indebted EU countries.",,"SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS,MONETARY-POLICY,VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIONS,STOCK MARKETS,VOLATILITY,MODELS,SHOCKS,TRANSMISSION,PRICES,RISK","Bacchiocchi, Emanuele@Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy","Bacchiocchi, Emanuele@University of Milan",not exist,"no title+Amisano, G.; Giannini, C.+TOPICS STRUCTURAL VA+1997::Sovereign rating news and financial marketsspillovers: Evidence from the European debt crisis+Arezki, R.; Candelon, B.; Sy, A.+IMF Working Paper 11/ 68+2011::International crises, instability periods and contagion: the case of the ERM+Bacchiocchi, E.; Bevilacqua, M.+Int Rev.

Control Function Approach for Partly Ordered Endogenous Treatments: Military Rank Premium in Wage,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12199,DEC 2017,0,1,"In treatment effect analysis, there are many cases where the treatment of interest is ordered (e.g. general-education years or medicine doses) and the control treatment is not zero, but a different type of treatment (a vocational training or a surgery). We develop an approach to find effects of partly ordered treatments, while correcting for possible treatment endogeneity with nearly parametric control functions. We use this control function approach, along with its supplementary version, to estimate effects of military ranks (ordered treatments) on wage relative to non-veteran status (control treatment) with the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study data. In our empirical analysis, the military rank effects differ much: officer has large positive effects, but enlisted ranks have small or no effects.",,,"Ju, Young-Min@Univ Southern Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA::Lee, Myoung-Jae@Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 02841, South Korea","Ju, Young-Min@University of Southern California::Lee, Myoung-Jae@Korea University",not exist,
Financial Depth and the Asymmetric Impact of Monetary Policy,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12160,DEC 2017,0,0,This paper investigates the importance of financial depth in evaluating the asymmetric impact of monetary policy on real output over the course of the US business cycle. We show that monetary policy has a significant impact on output growth during recessions. We also show that financial deepening plays an important role by dampening the effects of monetary policy shocks in recessions. The results are robust to the use of alternative financial depth and monetary policy shock measures as well as to two different sample periods.,,,"Caglayan, Mustafa@Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Social Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland::Kocaaslan, Ozge Kandemir@Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Beytepe Yerleskesi, Cankaya Ankara, Turkey::Mouratidis, Kostas@Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England","Caglayan, Mustafa@Heriot Watt University::Kocaaslan, Ozge Kandemir@Hacettepe University::Mouratidis, Kostas@University of Sheffield",not exist,
"Land Market Restrictions, Women's Labour Force Participation and Wages in a Rural Economy",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12159,OCT 2017,27,0,"We analyse the effects of land market restrictions on the rural labour market outcomes for women. The existing literature emphasizes two mechanisms through which land restrictions can affect economic outcomes: collateral value of land, and (in)security of property rights. Our analysis focuses on an alternative mechanism where land restrictions increase costs of migration out of villages. Testable prediction of collateral channel is that wages remain unchanged, but the effects on labour force participation are ambiguous. Insecurity of property rights in land reduces labour force participation, but leaves wages undisturbed. In contrast, if land restrictions work primarily through higher migration costs, labour force participation increases, while wages decline. For identification, we exploit a natural experiment in Sri Lanka where historical malaria played a unique role in land policy. We provide robust evidence of a positive effect of land restrictions on women's labour force participation, but a negative effect on female wages. The empirical results thus contradict a collateral or insecure property rights effect, but supports migration costs as the primary mechanism.",,"PROPERTY-RIGHTS,INVESTMENT,HETEROSCEDASTICITY,BANGLADESH,SELECTION,CHINA","Emran, M.

Most economics research is, however, observational and specification searches may often result in estimates that are biased and inconsistent, for example, due to omitted-variable biases. We show that if the authors of primary studies search for statistically significant estimates in observational research, meta-regression models tend to make false-positive findings of genuine empirical effects. More research is needed to better understand how meta-regression models need to be specified to help identifying genuine empirical effects in observational research.",,"PUBLICATION SELECTION,MINIMUM-WAGE,METAANALYSIS,BIAS,SCIENCE,ECONOMETRICS,JOURNALS,FACTS","Bruns, Stephan B.@Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Bruns, Stephan B.@University of Gottingen",not exist,"The effect of globalization on capital taxation: What have we learned after 20 years of empirical studies?+Adam, Antonis; Kammas, Pantelis; Lagou, Athina+JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS+MAR 2013::The synthesis of regression slopes in meta-analysis+Becker, Betsy Jane; Wu, Meng-Jia+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2007::Education and Economic Growth: A Meta-Regression Analysis+Benos, Nikos; Zotou, Stefania+WORLD DEVELOPMENT+DEC 2014::Star Wars: The Empirics Strike Back+Brodeur, Abel; Le, Mathias; Sangnier, Marc; et al.+AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-APPLIED ECONOMICS+JAN 2016::Meta-Granger Causality Testing+Bruns, S.

Do Smaller Classes Always Improve Students' Long-run Outcomes?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12161,OCT 2017,82,0,"We exploit the strict class size rule in Norway and matched individual and school register information for 1982-2011 to estimate long-run causal effects on income and educational attainment. Contrary to recent evidence from the US and Sweden, we do not find any significant average effect on long-run outcomes of reduced class size. We further use the large register data set and quasi-experimental strategy to estimate whether the class size effect depends on external conditions facing students and schools, such as teacher quality, extent of upper secondary school choice, school district size, local fiscal constraints and labour market conditions. Overall, we find that the class size effect does not depend on these factors measured at the school district level. The absence of class size effects on long-run outcomes in Norway is consistent with earlier findings for short-run outcomes, using comparable data and empirical strategies.",,"SCHOOL-DISTRICT SIZE,TEACHERS UNIONS,PUBLIC-SECTOR,EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT,SCHOLASTIC ACHIEVEMENT,EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE,PROPERTY TAXATION,PROJECT STAR,EARLY GRADES,REFORM","Falch, Torberg@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway::Sandsor, Astrid Marie Jorde@Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Postboks 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway::Strom, Bjarne@Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Falch, Torberg@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)::Sandsor, Astrid Marie Jorde@University of Oslo::Strom, Bjarne@Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)",not exist,"The impact of local funding on the technical efficiency of Oklahoma schools+Adkins, LC; Moomaw, RL+ECONOMICS LETTERS+OCT 2003::New Evidence on Class Size Effects: A Pupil Fixed Effects Approach+Altinok, Nadir; Kingdon, Geeta+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+APR 2012::Employer learning and statistical discrimination+Altonji, JG; Pierret, CR+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2001::Do you want your child to have a certified teacher?+Andersson, Christian; Johansson, Per; Waldenstrom, Nina+ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW+FEB 2011::In a Small Moment: Class Size and Moral Hazard in the Mezzogiorno+Angrist, J.

The Sorting of Female Careers after First Birth: A Competing Risks Analysis of Maternity Leave Duration,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12158,OCT 2017,43,0,"A number of contributions have found evidence that motherhood is a critical life event for women's employment careers. This study presents a detailed analysis for the duration of maternity leave in which young mothers can make a transition into different types of employment, unemployment as well as the next birth. We provide a comprehensive picture of the sorting mechanisms that lead to the differentiation of women's employment careers after birth. Our empirical evidence is derived from large-linked administrative individual labour market data from Germany for a period of three decades. We obtain unprecedented insights into how women's skills, the quality of the previous job match, firm level characteristics, labour market conditions and leave legislation are related to the length of maternity duration. Expansionary leave policies, e.g. are found to be a key factor for the rising share of women who have their second child out of inactivity.",,"LABOR-MARKET,WAGE PENALTY,PARENTAL LEAVE,WOMENS CAREERS,CHILD-CARE,WORK,EMPLOYMENT,MOTHERHOOD,FAMILY,PAID","Arntz, Melanie@ZEW Mannheim, L7-1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany@Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Wirtschaftswissensch, Bergheimer Str 58, DE-69115 Heidelberg, Germany::Dlugosz, Stephan@ZEW Mannheim, L7-1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany::Wilke, Ralf A.@ZEW Mannheim, L7-1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany@Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark","Arntz, Melanie@Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW)@Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg::Dlugosz, Stephan@Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW)::Wilke, Ralf A.@Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW)@Copenhagen Business School",not exist,"Dynamic discrete choice structural models: A survey+Aguirregabiria, Victor; Mira, Pedro+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 2010::An international comparison and assessment of maternity leave legislation+Alewell, D.; Pull, K.+Comparative Labor Law &amp; Policy Journal+2001::The motherhood wage penalty revisited: Experience, heterogeneity, work effort, and work-schedule flexibility+Anderson, DJ; Binder, M; Krause, K+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+JAN 2003::Children and their parents' labor supply: Evidence from exogenous variation in family size+Angrist, JD; Evans, WN+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1998::no title+BAUM C+LABOUR+2002::The effect of state maternity leave legislation and the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act on employment and wages+Baum, CL+LABOUR ECONOMICS+OCT 2003::Life course transitions and housework: Marriage, parenthood, and time on housework+Baxter, Janeen; Hewitt, Belinda; Haynes, Michele+JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY+MAY 2008::Establishment-level wage effects of entering motherhood+Beblo, Miriam; Bender, Stefan; Wolf, Elke+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+APR 2009::COVARIANCE ANALYSIS OF CENSORED SURVIVAL DATA+BRESLOW, N+BIOMETRICS+1974::The wage penalty for motherhood+Budig, MJ; England, P+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW+APR 2001::Work and Wage Dynamics around Childbirth+Ejrnaes, Mette; Kunze, Astrid+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+2013::A proportional hazards model for the subdistribution of a competing risk+Fine, JP; Gray, RJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1999::Imputation Rules to Improve the Education Variable in the IAB Employment Subsample+Fitzenberger, B.; Osikominu, A.; Volter, R.+Schmollers Jahrbuch: Journal of Applied Social Science Studies+2006::Return-to-job during and after parental leave+Fitzenberger, Bernd; Steffes, Susanne; Strittmatter, Anthony+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT+APR 27 2016::Causal effects on employment after first birth - A dynamic treatment approach+Fitzenberger, Bernd; Sommerfeld, Katrin; Steffes, Susanne+LABOUR ECONOMICS+DEC 2013::Determinants of mothers's re-entry in the labour market in full or part time+Frodermann, Corinna; Mueller, Dana; Abraham, Martin+KOLNER ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE UND SOZIALPSYCHOLOGIE+DEC 2013::MOTHERHOOD, LABOR FORCE BEHAVIOR, AND WOMEN'S CAREERS: AN EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE WAGE PENALTY FOR MOTHERHOOD IN BRITAIN, GERMANY, AND THE UNITED STATES+Gangl, Markus; Ziefle, Andrea+DEMOGRAPHY+MAY 2009::First-time parents' postpartum changes in employment, childcare, and housework responsibilities+Gjerdingen, DK; Center, BA+SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH+MAR 2005::Women's labor force transitions in connection with childbirth: A panel data comparison between Germany, Sweden and Great Britain+Gustafsson, SS; Wetzels, CMMP; Vlasblom, JD; et al.+JOURNAL OF POPULATION ECONOMICS+AUG 1996::Employment after motherhood: a European comparison+Gutierrez-Domenech, M+LABOUR ECONOMICS+FEB 2005::Who benefits from paid family leave?

Life-Cycle Consumption and Children: Evidence from a Structural Estimation,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12170,OCT 2017,45,0,"I estimate by maximum likelihood a dynamic model of optimal intertemporal allocation of consumption in the presence of children using high-quality Danish longitudinal data. The number and age of all children can affect the marginal utility of consumption while income uncertainty, credit constraints and postretirement motives also influence household behaviour. While I estimate that children have a surprisingly small effect on the marginal utility of non-durable consumption, data simulated from the estimated model replicates similar correlations between log consumption growth and changing household composition as found in the Danish data and typically found in UK and US data. To reconcile the results with existing studies, I illustrate how ignoring precautionary motives increases the estimated importance of children. The results indicate that precautionary motives might play a larger role than children in explaining the observed consumption age profile.",,"EULER EQUATIONS,INCOME,INSURANCE,EXPENDITURES,OPTIMIZATION,CONSTRAINTS,ALLOCATION,SAVINGS,MODELS,CHOICE","Jorgensen, Thomas H.@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark","Jorgensen, Thomas H.@University of Copenhagen","Hogholm Jorgensen, Thomas@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2570-9772","Comments on ""Convergence Properties of the Likelihood of Computed Dynamic Models""+Ackerberg, Daniel; Geweke, John; Hahn, Jinyong+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2009::The career costs of children+Adda, J.; Dustmann, C.; Stevens, K.+Journal of Political Economy.+no time::Euler Equation Estimation on Micro Data+Alan, S.; Atalay, K.; Crossley, T.

The identification of the parameters benefits from a major tax reform in the data period. We uncover large differences in behavioural responses. In particular, we find differences in labour supply responses between households with and without children that are much bigger than suggested by previous studies that had to pool these household types in the estimation of preferences.

Testing for Flexible Nonlinear Trends with an Integrated or Stationary Noise Component,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12169,OCT 2017,31,0,"This paper proposes a new test for the presence of a nonlinear deterministic trend approximated by a Fourier expansion in a univariate time series for which there is no prior knowledge as to whether the noise component is stationary or contains an autoregressive unit root. Our approach builds on the work of Perron and Yabu () and is based on a Feasible Generalized Least Squares procedure that uses a super-efficient estimator of the sum of the autoregressive coefficients when =1. The resulting Wald test statistic asymptotically follows a chi-square distribution in both the I(0) and I(1) cases.

Direct Estimation of Equivalence Scales and More Evidence on Independence of Base,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12166,OCT 2017,52,1,"We explore a direct approach to estimating household equivalence scales from income satisfaction data. Our method differs from previous approaches to using satisfaction data for this purpose in that it can be used to directly fit and evaluate closed-form and non-parametric equivalence scales of any desired form. Its flexibility makes it easy to consider specific aspects such as income dependence or more specific information on household composition (such as whether household members live in a partner relationship). We estimate and evaluate a number of scales used in the literature. If the equivalence scale is assumed to be independent of income and to depend only on household size, we do not reject the validity of the widely used square-root scale at conventional significance levels. We also test GESE and GAESE restrictions (Donaldson and Pendakur, 2003, 2006) and investigate in detail to what extent household economies of scale depend on income. Our results suggest that the income dependence differs fundamentally across household types (rising economies of scale for family' households, falling economies of scale for multi-adult households without children and no income dependence for other households).",,"PANEL-DATA,INCOME,WELFARE,UTILITY,IDENTIFICATION,SATISFACTION,EXPENDITURE,CONSUMPTION,DEPENDENCE,ECONOMIES","Biewen, Martin@Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany::Juhasz, Andos@Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany","Biewen, Martin@Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen::Juhasz, Andos@Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen",not exist,"Income distribution in OECD countries+Atkinson, A.

"Ethnic Fractionalization, Governance and Loan Defaults in Africa",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12152,AUG 2017,16,1,We present a theoretical model of an imperfectly competitive loans market that is suitable for emerging economies in Africa. The model allows for variation in both the level of contract enforcement (the quality of governance) and the degree of market segmentation (the level of ethnic fractionalization). The model predicts a specific form of nonlinearity in the effects of these variables on loan default. Empirical analysis using African panel data for 110 individual banks in 28 countries over 2000-08 provides strong evidence for these predictions. Our results have important implications for the conditions under which policy reform will enhance financial development.,,"CREDIT MARKETS,INFORMATION,COMPETITION,FINANCE","Andrianova, Svetlana@Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England::Baltagi, Badi H.@Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England@Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 110 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA::Demetriades, Panicos@Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England::Fielding, David@Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand","Andrianova, Svetlana@University of Leicester::Baltagi, Badi H.@Syracuse University@University of Leicester::Demetriades, Panicos@University of Leicester::Fielding, David@University of Otago",not exist,"Are Borders Barriers?

On Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Dynamic Panel Data Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12156,AUG 2017,31,0,"We analyse the finite sample properties of maximum likelihood estimators for dynamic panel data models. In particular, we consider transformed maximum likelihood (TML) and random effects maximum likelihood (RML) estimation. We show that TML and RML estimators are solutions to a cubic first-order condition in the autoregressive parameter. Furthermore, in finite samples both likelihood estimators might lead to a negative estimate of the variance of the individual-specific effects. We consider different approaches taking into account the non-negativity restriction for the variance. We show that these approaches may lead to a solution different from the unique global unconstrained maximum. In an extensive Monte Carlo study we find that this issue is non-negligible for small values of T and that different approaches might lead to different finite sample properties. Furthermore, we find that the Likelihood Ratio statistic provides size control in small samples, albeit with low power due to the flatness of the log-likelihood function. We illustrate these issues modelling US state level unemployment dynamics.",,"POOLING CROSS-SECTION,TIME-SERIES DATA,INITIAL CONDITIONS,COMPONENTS MODELS,INFERENCE","Bun, Maurice J.

Quantile Aggregation of Density Forecasts,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12163,AUG 2017,34,0,"Quantile aggregation (or 'Vincentization') is a simple and intuitive way of combining probability distributions, originally proposed by S.B. Vincent in 1912. In certain cases, such as under Gaussianity, the Vincentized distribution belongs to the same family as that of the individual distributions and it can be obtained by averaging the individual parameters. This article compares the properties of quantile aggregation with those of the forecast combination schemes normally adopted in the econometric forecasting literature, based on linear or logarithmic averages of the individual densities. Analytical results and Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the properties of quantile aggregation are between those of the linear and the logarithmic pool. Larger differences among the combination schemes occur when there are biases in the individual forecasts: in that case quantile aggregation seems preferable on the whole. The practical usefulness of Vincentization is illustrated empirically in the context of linear forecasting models for Italian GDP and quantile predictions of euro area inflation.",,"COMBINING DENSITY,INFLATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,COMBINATION,PREDICTION","Busetti, Fabio@Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy","Busetti, Fabio@Unknow",not exist,"Comparing density forecasts via weighted likelihood ratio tests+Amisano, Gianni; Giacomini, Raffaella+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 2007::COMBINATION OF FORECASTS+BATES, JM; GRANGER, CWJ+OPERATIONAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY+1969::Time-varying combinations of predictive densities using nonlinear filtering+Billio, Monica; Casarin, Roberto; Ravazzolo, Francesco; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+DEC 2013::The Inflation Report projections: understanding the fan chart+Britton, E.; Fisher, P.; Whitley, J.+Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin+1998::On the Conditional Distribution of Euro Area Inflation Fore-casts+Busetti, F.; Caivano, M.; Rodano, L.+Bank of ItalyWorking Papers No+2015::The Macroeconomic Impact of the Sovereign Debt Crisis: A Counterfactual Analysis for the Italian Economy+Busetti, F.; Cova, P.+Occasional Papers No+2013::Optimal prediction under asymmetric loss+Christoffersen, PF; Diebold, FX+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+DEC 1997::PREDICTIVE DENSITY EVALUATION+Corradi, Valentina; Swanson, Norman R.+HANDBOOK OF ECONOMIC FORECASTING: VOL 1+2006::Bootstrap conditional distribution tests in the presence of dynamic misspecification+Corradi, Valentina; Swanson, Norman R.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+AUG 2006::Dynamic prediction pools: An investigation of financial frictions and forecasting performance+Del Negro, Marco; Hasegawa, Raiden B.; Schorfheide, Frank+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2016::Evaluating density forecasts with applications to financial risk management+Diebold, FX; Gunther, TA; Tay, AS+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+NOV 1998::The geometric combination of Bayesian forecasting models+Faria, A.

Measuring Business Cycles Intra-Synchronization in US: A Regime-switching Interdependence Framework,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12157,AUG 2017,45,0,"This paper proposes a Markov-switching framework to endogenously identify periods where economies are more likely to (i) synchronously enter recessionary and expansionary phases, and (ii) follow independent business cycles. The reliability of the framework is validated with simulated data in Monte Carlo experiments. The framework is applied to assess the time-varying intra-country synchronization in the US. The main results report substantial changes over time in the cyclical affiliation patterns of US states, and show that the more similar the economic structures of states, the higher the correlation between their business cycles. A synchronization-based network analysis discloses a change in the propagation pattern of aggregate contractionary shocks across states, suggesting that the US has become more internally synchronized since the early 1990s.",,"AGGREGATE FLUCTUATIONS,EURO-AREA,NONLINEARITY,RECESSIONS,PERMANENT,ORIGINS,MODELS,PHASES,STATES,WORLD","Leiva-Leon, Danilo@Banco Espana, DG Econ & Res, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain","Leiva-Leon, Danilo@Unknow",not exist,"The Network Origins of Aggregate Fluctuations+Acemoglu, Daron; Carvalho, Vasco M.; Ozdaglar, Asuman; et al.+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2012::BAYES INFERENCE VIA GIBBS SAMPLING OF AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES SUBJECT TO MARKOV MEAN AND VARIANCE SHIFTS+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1993::Business Cycle Analysis with Multivariate Markov Switching Models+Anas, J.; Billio, M.; Ferrara, L.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Lo Duca, M</span>.+Working Papers+2007::Dating business cycles: A methodological contribution with an application to the Euro area+Artis, M; Marcellino, M; Proietti, T+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+SEP 2004::CONDITIONAL MARKOV CHAIN AND ITS APPLICATION IN ECONOMIC TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+Bai, Jushan; Wang, Peng+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+AUG 2011::A useful tool for forecasting the Euro-area business cycle phases+Bengoechea, Pilar; Camacho, Maximo; Perez-Quiros, Gabriel+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING+2006::A check on the robustness of Hamilton's Markov Switching model approach to the economic analysis of the business cycle+Boldin, M.

The Macroeconomic Effects of Shocks to Large Banks' Capital,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12162,AUG 2017,52,0,We propose a simple approach to quantifying the macroeconomic effects of shocks to large banks' leverage. We first estimate a standard dynamic model of leverage targeting at the bank level and use it to derive an aggregate measure of the economic capital buffer of large US bank holding corporations. We then evaluate the response of key macro variables to a shock to this aggregate bank capital buffer using standard monetary VAR models. We find that shocks to the capital of large US banks explain a substantial share of the variance of credit to firms and real activity.,,"PANEL-DATA MODELS,CREDIT CRUNCH,LENDING CHANNEL,MONETARY-POLICY,BUSINESS-CYCLE,EURO AREA,FLUCTUATIONS,BEHAVIOR,MARKETS,SPREADS","Mesonnier, Jean-Stephane@Banque France, F-75001 Paris, France::Stevanovic, Dalibor@CIRANO, UQAM, 405 Rue St Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H2L 2C4, Canada@CIRPEE, 405 Rue St Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H2L 2C4, Canada@ESG UQAM, 405 Rue St Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H2L 2C4, Canada","Mesonnier, Jean-Stephane@Unknow::Stevanovic, Dalibor@University of Quebec@University of Montreal@University of Quebec Montreal",not exist,"no title+Adrian, T.; Moench, E.; Shin, H.

Moreover, the UK premium has continued to rise despite the financial crisis. We show that earnings increase faster with value added in certain sub-sectors of finance, compared to the general economy, providing evidence of profit-sharing in these sub-sectors.

The econometric analysis exploits a new data set on intangible investment (INTAN-Invest) in conjunction with EUKLEMS productivity estimates for 10 EU member states from 1998 to 2007. We find that (a) the output elasticity of intangible capital depends upon ICT intensity, consistent with complementarities between ICT and intangible capital; (b) non-R&D intangible capital has a higher estimated output elasticity than its factor share, as does (c) an index of labour composition.

Size Matters: The Effect of the Size of Ethnic Groups on Development,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12145,JUN 2017,101,1,"The share of ethnic groups is one of the most important features of African politics. It affects civil wars, representation in government positions, distributive and allocative policies. In this paper, we use the partition of ethnic groups as a natural experiment in order to estimate the effect of the share of these ethnic groups on development. We show that larger groups have an advantage in terms of development and that the partition in itself does not matter for development. This result is explained by the fact that the partition matters only when the resulting groups are relatively small, since their lack of political representation may weaken support for institutions, may bias policies and the provision of ethnic/regional public goods.",,"REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGNS,PUBLIC-GOODS,AFRICA,INSTITUTIONS,STATES,FRACTIONALIZATION,CONFLICT,NETWORKS,POLITICS,GROWTH","Dimico, Arcangelo@Queens Univ Belfast, Management Sch, 185 Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland","Dimico, Arcangelo@Queens University Belfast",not exist,"The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S; Robinson, JA+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2001::Politics and economics in weak and strong states+Acemoglu, D+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+OCT 2005::Unbundling institutions+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 2005::Reversal of fortune: Geography and institutions in the making of the modern world income distribution+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S; Robinson, JA+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2002::Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth+Acemoglu, D.; Johnson, S.; Robinson, J.

Determinants of Relative Sectoral Prices: The Role of Demographic Change,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12149,JUN 2017,59,0,"Demographic change raises demand for non-tradable old-age related services relative to tradable commodities. This demand shift increases the relative price of non-tradables and thereby causes real exchange rates to appreciate. We claim that the change in demand affects prices via imperfect intersectoral factor mobility. Using a sample of 15 OECD countries, we estimate a robust increase of relative prices. According to our main estimate, up to one fifth of the average increase in relative prices between 1970 and 2009 can be attributed to population ageing. Further findings confirm the relevance of imperfect factor mobility: Countries with more rigid labour markets experience stronger price effects.",,"REAL EXCHANGE-RATE,PURCHASING-POWER PARITY,PANEL-DATA,HETEROGENEOUS PANELS,NONTRADED GOODS,LONG-RUN,LABOR,RATES,PRODUCTIVITY,REAPPRAISAL","Groneck, Max@Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden@Netspar, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden::Kaufmann, Christoph@Univ Cologne, CMR, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Groneck, Max@Stockholm School of Economics::Kaufmann, Christoph@University of Cologne",not exist,"The role of demography in the long-run Yen/USD real exchange rate appreciation+Aloy, Marcel; Gente, Karine+JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS+DEC 2009::Forecasting real exchange rate trends using age structure data - the case of Sweden+Andersson, A; Osterholm, P+APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS+APR 15 2005::O  sterholm, P.: Population age structure and real exchange rate in the OECD+Andersson, A.+Int.

Impact of Changes in Consumer Preferences on Sectoral Labour Reallocation: Evidence from the Italian Economy,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12179,JUN 2017,33,1,"This study empirically investigates the impact of changes in consumer preferences on labour reallocation across the Italian economic sectors. For this purpose, coherent sectoral time series of consumer preferences and labour units are constructed from Italian national accounts and consumption expenditure data. In line with recent firm-level evidence, empirical findings indicate a positive and significant effect of preference changes on labour reallocation.

Monetary Policy and Macroprudential Policy: New Evidence from a World Panel of Countries,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12182,JUN 2017,49,1,"The event of the recent financial crisis raises the question of whether policy makers could have done more or something different to prevent the build-up of financial imbalances. This paper contributes to the field of regulatory impact by tackling the debate on whether central banks should lean against the wind', while in case the response is positive, how macroprudential policies should be combined with monetary policy. Using an augmented Taylor rule and a sample of 127 global economies, the results provide evidence on the importance of macroprudential issues for the implementation of an effective monetary policy. They also document that the type of adopted macroprudential instrument has a substantial effect on such effectiveness, with this policy mix being less integrated' when the monetary rule aims at primarily safeguarding inflation stability.

A Cautionary Tale About Control Variables in IV Estimation,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12177,JUN 2017,33,0,"Many instrumental variable (IV) regressions include control variables to justify (conditional) independence of the instrument and the potential outcomes. The plausibility of conditional IV independence crucially depends on the timing when the control variables are determined. This paper works through different IV models and discusses the (conditions for the) satisfaction of conditional IV independence depending on whether the control variables are measured prior to or after instrument assignment. To illustrate the identification issues, we consider the Vietnam War draft risk as instrument either for veteran status or education to evaluate the effects of these variables on labour market and health outcomes. Our empirical analysis based on the Young Men in High School and Beyond' survey suggests that commonly used conditional IV strategies to estimate the impact of draft induced military service or education may be severely biased due to the use of improper controls.",,"DRAFT LOTTERY,MILITARY SERVICE,VIETNAM-ERA,SELECTION BIAS,HEALTH,CAUSAL,WAR,EDUCATION,VETERANS,COLLEGE","Deuchert, Eva@Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, Bd Perolles 90, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland::Huber, Martin@Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, Bd Perolles 90, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland","Deuchert, Eva@University of Fribourg::Huber, Martin@University of Fribourg",not exist,"LIFETIME EARNINGS AND THE VIETNAM ERA DRAFT LOTTERY - EVIDENCE FROM SOCIAL-SECURITY ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS+ANGRIST, JD+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1990::no title+Angrist, JD; Krueger, AB.+Estimating the Payoff to Schooling Using the Vietnam-Era Draft Lottery+1992::THE DRAFT LOTTERY AND VOLUNTARY ENLISTMENT IN THE VIETNAM ERA+ANGRIST, JD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1991::Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricists Companion+Angrist, JD; Pischke, JS+MOSTLY HARMLESS ECONOMETRICS: AN EMPIRICISTS COMPANION+2009::Schooling and the Vietnam-Era GI Bill: Evidence from the Draft Lottery+Angrist, Joshua D.; Chen, Stacey H.+AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-APPLIED ECONOMICS+APR 2011::Did Vietnam veterans get sicker in the 1990s?

Identification Based on Difference-in-Differences Approaches with Multiple Treatments,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12178,JUN 2017,16,2,"This paper discusses identification based on difference-in-differences (DiD) approaches with multiple treatments. It shows that an appropriate adaptation of the common trend assumption underlying the DiD strategy for the comparison of two treatments restricts the possibility of effect heterogeneity for at least one of the treatments. The required assumption of effect homogeneity is likely to be violated because of non-random assignment to treatment based on both observables and unobservables. However, this paper shows that, under certain conditions, the DiD estimate comparing two treatments identifies a lower bound in absolute values on the average treatment effect on the treated compared to the unobserved non-treatment state, even if effect homogeneity is violated. This is possible if the treatments have ordered treatment effects, that is, in expectation, the effects of both treatments compared to no treatment have the same sign, and one treatment has a stronger effect than the other treatment on the respective recipients. Such assumptions are plausible if treatments are ordered or vary in intensity.",,"PROPENSITY SCORE,CHILD-CARE,EMPLOYMENT,INDONESIA","Fricke, Hans@Stanford Univ, Ctr Educ Policy Anal, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Fricke, Hans@Stanford University",not exist,"Semiparametric difference-in-differences estimators+Abadie, A+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JAN 2005::The impact of minimum wages on employment in a low-income country: A quasi-natural experiment in Indonesia+Alatas, Vivi; Cameron, Lisa A.+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+JAN 2008::2-STAGE LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATION OF AVERAGE CAUSAL EFFECTS IN MODELS WITH VARIABLE TREATMENT INTENSITY+ANGRIST, JD; IMBENS, GW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::Fuzzy differences-in-differences+De Chaisemartin, C.; D'Haultfoeuille, X.+ArXiv: 1510.01757+2015::Schooling and labor market consequences of school construction in Indonesia: Evidence from an unusual policy experiment+Duflo, E+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 2001::Can't buy mommy's love?

Partial Structural Break Identification,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12153,APR 2017,17,0,"We propose an extension of the existing information criterion-based structural break identification approaches. The extended approach helps identify both pure structural change (break) and partial structural change (break). A pure structural change refers to the case when breaks occur simultaneously in all parameters of regression equation, whereas a partial structural change happens when breaks occur in some parameters only. Our approach consistently outperforms other well-known approaches. We also extend the simulation studies of Bai and Perron (2006) and Hall, Osborn and Sakkas (2013) by including more general cases. This provides more comprehensive results and reveals the cases where the existing identification approaches lose power, which should be kept in mind when applying them.",,"INFORMATION CRITERION,CHANGE MODELS,CHANGE-POINT,INSTABILITY","Han, Chulwoo@Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England::Taamouti, Abderrahim@Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England","Han, Chulwoo@Durham University::Taamouti, Abderrahim@Durham University",not exist,"no title+Akaike, H.+Information theory and an extension of the 2nd maximum likelihood principle+1973::TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::no title+BAI J+ANN ECON FINANC+2000::Multiple structural change models: a simulation study+Bai, J.; Perron, P.+Econometric theory and practice: Frontiers of analysis and applied research+2006::Computation and analysis of multiple structural change models+Bai, J; Perron, P+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 2003::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::Detection of structural breaks in a time-varying heteroskedastic regression model+Chen, Cathy W.

Pricing in the Norwegian Interbank Market - the Effects of Liquidity and Implicit Government Support,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12147,APR 2017,53,0,"We investigate the effects of central bank liquidity and possible implicit government guarantees against default on Norwegian overnight interbank interest rates. We conduct an econometric study of these interest rates over the period 2006-09, which includes the sharp fall in interbank trading during the financial crisis. Our findings suggest relatively lower funding costs for banks of systemic importance, particularly for banks with many and valuable linkages to other banks. Moreover, interest rates are found to depend not only on overall liquidity in the interbank market, but on its distribution among banks as well. There is also evidence of stronger effects on interest rates of systemic importance, creditworthiness and liquidity demand and supply factors during the financial crisis.",,"FEDERAL-FUNDS MARKET,RISK,BANKING,COMPETITION,FIRMS,SIZE","Akram, Q.

Information Frictions in Uncertain Regulatory Environments: Evidence from US Commercial Banks,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12143,APR 2017,54,1,"Information frictions between firms and regulators are typically seen as a means by which firms evade enforcement. In contrast, we argue that information frictions between firms and regulators can reduce the efficiency of firms' compliance efforts when the interpretation of regulatory standards is uncertain. We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in distance between firms and their regulators to demonstrate this for a panel of community banks in the US. We find that banks located at greater distance from regulatory field offices face significantly higher administrative costs, at a rate of 20% of administrative costs per hour of travel time. These differences do not come with reduced compliance, are not driven by endogenous regulator choice, and are stable over time. Further, the costs borne by distant firms are negatively related to the scale of the jurisdiction in which they operate, suggesting that information spillovers between firms limit uncertainty about regulatory expectations.",,"TACIT KNOWLEDGE,INVESTMENT,GEOGRAPHY,ENFORCEMENT,SPILLOVERS,INNOVATION,NETWORKS,INDUSTRY,IMPACT,FIRMS","Wilson, Kristin@Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Campus Box 3490,McColl 4612, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA::Veuger, Stan@Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Econ Policy Studies, 1150 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA","Wilson, Kristin@University of North Carolina@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill::Veuger, Stan@Unknow","Veuger, Stan@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0775-2232","Inconsistent regulators: evidence from banking+Agarwal, S.; Lucca, D.; Seru, A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Trebbi, F</span>.+The Quarterly Journal of Economics+2014::Networking off Madison Avenue+Arzaghi, Mohammad; Henderson, J.

"Consumer Search Ability, Price Dispersion and the Digital Divide",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12151,APR 2017,33,3,"The 'digital divide' in online activities is believed to arise from differences in Internet access, but this paper advances an alternative explanation that is related to consumer search ability. It argues that this leads to greater price dispersion, causing some consumers to be discriminated against. It analyses price data for the UK Internet motor insurance market, collecting data on 32,255 prices for 110 sub-markets, where differences in price dispersion across these by age, occupation and sex of the driver are argued to reflect differences in search ability. Allowing for price dispersion to also depend on the insurance risk, it finds greater price dispersion for consumers with weaker search abilities, i.e. older, unemployed, retired or female consumers. As this is not explained by alternative hypotheses, the paper concludes that improved Internet access alone will not close the 'digital divide'. The implication is that policymakers should address the online search abilities of individuals as well as Internet access.",,"INTERNET,FIRMS,MODEL","McDonald, Stephen@Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Econ, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England::Wren, Colin@Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Econ, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England","McDonald, Stephen@Newcastle University - UK::Wren, Colin@Newcastle University - UK",not exist,"How to Deal with Sovereign Funds+[Anonymous].+Financial Times+22 October 2007::THE ECONOMIC-IMPLICATIONS OF LEARNING BY DOING+ARROW, KJ+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+1962::Price dispersion in the small and in the large: Evidence from an internet price comparison site+Baye, MR; Morgan, J; Scholten, P+JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS+DEC 2004::Price dispersion on the Internet: Good firms and bad firms+Baylis, K; Perloff, JM+REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION+NOV 2002::Does the Internet make markets more competitive?

Labour Costs and the Size of Government,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12140,APR 2017,47,1,"Given inelastic demand for labour-intensive public services, the size of government depends positively on labour costs. OECD data exhibit a strong statistical association between government size and the business-sector labour share of income. When the labour share is instrumented with measures of technological change, institutional variation and predetermined data it continues to positively impact government size. In contrast, transfer spending is unaffected by the labour share. The evidence is consistent with the idea that the recent decline in the labour share has contributed to the slowdown in the growth of government witnessed in much of the post-war era.",,"PANEL-DATA MODELS,GROWTH,EXPENDITURE,BIAS,US","Facchini, Francois@Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, MSE, Paris, France::Melki, Mickael@Fribourg Univ, Dept Econ, Blvd Perolles 90, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland::Pickering, Andrew@Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Facchini, Francois@heSam Universite@Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne::Melki, Mickael@Unknow::Pickering, Andrew@University of York - UK","Facchini, Francois@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9471-0385::Pickering, Andrew@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1545-2192","no title+Adolph, Wagner.+Grundlegung der Politischen Oekonomie+1893::Privatization and the Decline of Labour's Share: International Evidence from Network Industries+Azmat, Ghazala; Manning, Alan; Van Reenen, John+ECONOMICA+JUL 2012::Human capital and growth+Barro, RJ+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 2001::MACROECONOMICS OF UNBALANCED GROWTH: THE ANATOMY OF URBAN CRISIS+Baumol, William J.+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1967::Explaining Movements in the Labor Share+Bentolila, S.; Saint-Paul, G.+Contributions to Macroeconomics+2003::Political Competition, Policy and Growth: Theory and Evidence from the US+Besley, Timothy; Persson, Torsten; Sturm, Daniel M.+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+OCT 2010::THE CAUSES OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE GROWTH - A SURVEY OF THE UNITED-STATES EVIDENCE+BORCHERDING, TE+JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS+DEC 1985::Growth in the real size of government since 1970+Borcherding, Thomas E.; Ferris, J.

System-Equation ADL Test for Threshold Cointegration with an Application to the Term Structure of Interest Rates,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12123,FEB 2017,26,1,"This paper proposes a new system-equation test for threshold cointegration based on a threshold vector autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) model. The new test can be applied when the cointegrating vector is unknown and when weak exogeneity fails. The asymptotic null distribution of the new test is derived, critical values are tabulated and finite-sample properties are examined. In particular, the new test is shown to have good size, so the bootstrap is not required. The new test is illustrated using the long-term and short-term interest rates. We show that the system-equation model can shed light on both asymmetric adjustment speeds and asymmetric adjustment roles. The latter is unavailable in the single-equation testing strategy.",,"ERROR-CORRECTION MODELS,NUISANCE PARAMETER,UNIT-ROOT,HYPOTHESIS,VECTOR,POWER,EQUILIBRIUM,ADJUSTMENT,INFERENCE,NULL","Li, Jing@Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Li, Jing@Miami University",not exist,"OPTIMAL TESTS WHEN A NUISANCE PARAMETER IS PRESENT ONLY UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE+ANDREWS, DWK; PLOBERGER, W+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1994::Threshold cointegration+Balke, NS; Fomby, TB+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+AUG 1997::EXPLORING EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONSHIPS IN ECONOMETRICS THROUGH STATIC MODELS - SOME MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE+BANERJEE, A; DOLADO, JJ; HENDRY, DF; et al.+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1986::TESTING FOR AN UNSTABLE ROOT IN CONDITIONAL AND STRUCTURAL ERROR-CORRECTION MODELS+BOSWIJK, HP+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1994::Threshold autoregression with a unit root+Caner, M; Hansen, BE+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2001::HYPOTHESIS-TESTING WHEN A NUISANCE PARAMETER IS PRESENT ONLY UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE+DAVIES, RB+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1987::HYPOTHESIS TESTING WHEN A NUISANCE PARAMETER IS PRESENT ONLY UNDER ALTERNATIVE+DAVIES, RB+BIOMETRIKA+1977::Cointegration and threshold adjustment+Enders, W; Siklos, PL+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 2001::EXCHANGE-RATES AND TRADED GOODS PRICES+GIOVANNINI, A+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+FEB 1988::no title+Hamilton, J.

A Spatial Duration Analysis,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12136,FEB 2017,38,1,"The spatial survival models typically impose frailties, which characterize unobserved heterogeneity, to be spatially correlated. However, the spatial effect may not only exist in the unobserved errors, but it can also be present in the baseline hazards and the dependent variables. A new spatial survival model with these three possible spatial correlation structures is explored and used to investigate the implementation of value-added tax (VAT) in 99 countries over the period 1970-2009. Estimation is performed by a Bayesian approach through the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The estimation results suggest the presence of a significant spatial correlation among the VAT introductions of neighbouring countries.",,"SURVIVAL-DATA,REGRESSION-MODELS,MONTE-CARLO,LIFE-TABLES,FRAILTY,DISTRIBUTIONS,COMPETITION,MORTALITY","Cizek, Pavel@Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & OR, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands::Lei, Jinghua@Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China::Ligthart, Jenny E.@Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & OR, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands","Cizek, Pavel@Tilburg University::Lei, Jinghua@Renmin University of China::Ligthart, Jenny E.@Tilburg University",not exist,"Openness, country size and government+Alesina, A; Wacziarg, R+JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS+SEP 1998::FISCAL PRESSURE, TAX COMPETITION, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF STATE LOTTERIES+ALM, J; MCKEE, M; SKIDMORE, M+NATIONAL TAX JOURNAL+DEC 1993::Frailty modeling for spatially correlated survival data, with application to infant mortality in Minnesota+Banerjee, S; Wall, MM; Carlin, BP+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2003::Dynamic survival models with spatial frailty+Bastos, Leonardo Soares; Gamerman, Dani+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 2006::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::INCUMBENT BEHAVIOR - VOTE-SEEKING, TAX-SETTING, AND YARDSTICK COMPETITION+BESLEY, T; CASE, A+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 1995::no title+Brockmeyer, A.+Does IMF Conditionality Work?

We also present evidence that indexation to past inflation has decrease as inflation stabilizes at lower levels. In addition, our results suggest that wage rigidity is not linked to the institutional environment at the macroeconomic level.

We consider these issues together for UK data, the National Child Development Study and British Cohort Study, for the first time. When all three biases are considered, our best estimate of lifetime intergenerational economic persistence in the UK is 0.43 for children born in 1970.

Mismatch and the Forecasting Performance of Matching Functions,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12142,FEB 2017,34,1,"This paper investigates the role of structural imbalance between job seekers and job openings for the forecasting performance of a labour market matching function. Starting from a Cobb-Douglas matching function with constant returns to scale (CRS) in each frictional micro market shows that on the aggregate level, a measure of mismatch is a crucial ingredient of the matching function and hence should not be ignored for forecasting hiring figures. Consequently, we allow the matching process to depend on the level of regional, qualificatory and occupational mismatch between unemployed and vacancies. In pseudo out-of-sample tests that account for the nested model environment, we find that forecasting models enhanced by a measure of mismatch significantly outperform their benchmark counterparts for all forecast horizons ranging between one month and a year. This is especially pronounced during and in the aftermath of the Great Recession where a low level of mismatch improved the possibility of unemployed to find a job again. The results show that imposing CRS helps improve forecast accuracy compared to unrestricted models.",,"LABOR-MARKET,PREDICTIVE ACCURACY,NESTED MODELS,TIME-SERIES,UNEMPLOYMENT,SEARCH,TESTS","Hutter, Christian@Inst Employment Res, Weddigenstr 20-22, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany::Weber, Enzo@Inst Employment Res, Weddigenstr 20-22, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany@Univ Regensburg, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany","Hutter, Christian@Unknow::Weber, Enzo@University of Regensburg",not exist,"Labor Market Heterogeneity and the Aggregate Matching Function+Barnichon, Regis; Figura, Andrew+AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-MACROECONOMICS+OCT 2015::The Ins and Outs of Forecasting Unemployment: Using Labor Force Flows to Forecast the Labor Market+Barnichon, Regis; Nekarda, Christopher J.+BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY+FAL 2012::Mismatch unemployment.

Quasi-Experimental Evidence on the Effects of Health Information on Preventive Behaviour in Europe,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12134,DEC 2016,62,1,"We investigate the effect of information on preventive decisions in a quasi-experimental setting arising from the implementation of local breast cancer screening programmes in Europe. To identify the causal effect of invitation on preventive uptake, we link administrative public data on regional screening policies to individual data from the Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and exploit regional variation in the availability of screening policies and in age eligibility criteria. We find home invitation increases mammography uptakes by around 24%. Significant effects are found when at least 50% of the population is reached by the invitation letter.

Household Shocks and Education Investments in Madagascar,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12129,DEC 2016,32,2,"This paper investigates the impact of exogenous shocks to household income, assets and labour supply on children's school attendance in Madagascar. The analysis uses a unique data set with 10 years of recall data on school attendance and household shocks. We find that the probability of a child dropping out of school increases significantly when the household experiences an illness, death or asset shock. We propose a test to distinguish whether the impact of shocks on school attendance can be attributed to credit constraints, labour market rigidities, or a combination of the two.

Global Engagement and Returns Volatility,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12150,DEC 2016,54,1,"This paper finds that a greater reliance on foreign market sales increases the volatility of firms' stock returns, using high-frequency data for publicly listed Japanese manufacturing firms over the period 2000-10. The two margins of global engagement we consider, namely, exports and sales via foreign affiliates (horizontal foreign direct investment), have both a positive and economically significant effect on firm-level volatility. We find, however, that increasing the intensity of sales through foreign affiliates has a stronger effect on volatility than a similar change in export intensity. We also uncover evidence consistent with the notion that firms' need to use external finance to cover the substantial costs involved in reaching foreign consumers can be an important channel through which firms' participation in international markets increases their exposure to economic uncertainty.",,"STOCK RETURNS,HETEROGENEOUS FIRMS,INTERNATIONAL-TRADE,INDIVIDUAL STOCKS,UNCERTAINTY,INVESTMENT,EXPORTS,RISK,TIME,FLUCTUATIONS","Girma, Sourafel@Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, GEP, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England@Univ Nottingham, CFCM, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Lancheros, Sandra@Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Kenworth Bldg, Leeds LS6 1AN, W Yorkshire, England::Riano, Alejandro@Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, GEP, CFCM, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England@Univ Nottingham, CESifo, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Girma, Sourafel@University of Nottingham::Lancheros, Sandra@University of Leeds::Riano, Alejandro@University of Nottingham","Riano, Alejandro@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8824-4055::Girma, Sourafel@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5815-1619","Stock Returns and Volatility: Pricing the Short-Run and Long-Run Components of Market Risk+Adrian, Tobias; Rosenberg, Joshua+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+DEC 2008::Exports and Financial Shocks+Amiti, Mary; Weinstein, David E.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2011::The distribution of realized stock return volatility+Andersen, TG; Bollerslev, T; Diebold, FX; et al.+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+JUL 2001::Multinational firms and the structure of international trade+Antras, P; Yeaple, SR.+HDB INT EC+2014::Financial Markets and Fluctuations in Uncertainty+Arellano, C.; Bai, Y.; Kehoe, P.+Meeting Papers No. 896+2011::Uncertainty and Economic Activity: Evidence from Business Survey Data+Bachmann, Ruediger; Elstner, Steffen; Sims, Eric R.+AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-MACROECONOMICS+APR 2013::Stock prices, news, and economic fluctuations+Beaudry, Paul; Portier, Franck+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 2006::Firms in international trade+Bernard, Andrew B.; Jensen, J.

Using individual-level data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), we decompose differences in employment status transition rates between upswings and downturns into explained and unexplained parts. We find that the duration of unemployment contributes to explaining unemployment outflows to employment and observe that its initially positive contribution turns negative in deep recessions.

We disentangle permanent and transitory components of all series determining the BC and its position. Cointegration and identification are addressed. The German curve is an ideal illustration as reforms of the institutional setting and the Great Recession were accompanied by a remarkable labour market development. We find an extraordinary increase in trend matching efficiency after the reforms, which testifies to a permanent improvement. Matching efficiency accounts for about half of the BC inward shift.

The Credibility of Hong Kong's Currency Board System: Looking Through the Prism of MS-VAR Models with Time-Varying Transition Probabilities,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12148,DEC 2016,39,0,This paper employs a Markov regime-switching VAR model to describe and analyse the time-varying credibility of Hong Kong's currency board system. The endogenously estimated discrete regime shifts are made dependent on macroeconomic fundamentals. This enables us to determine which changes in macroeconomic variables can trigger switches between the low and high credibility regimes. We carry out extensive testing to search for the most appropriate specification of the Markov regime-switching model. We find strong evidence of regime switching behaviour that portrays the time-varying nature of credibility in the historical data.,,"MONETARY-POLICY,BUSINESS-CYCLE,SWITCHING APPROACH,SHOCKS,VOLATILITY,ECONOMICS,REGIMES,IMPACT","Blagov, Boris@Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany::Funke, Michael@Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany@CESifo Munich, D-81679 Munich, Germany","Blagov, Boris@University of Hamburg::Funke, Michael@Ifo Institut@University of Hamburg",not exist,"NON-LINEARITIES IN THE RELATION BETWEEN THE EXCHANGE RATE AND ITS FUNDAMENTALS+Altavilla, Carlo; De Grauwe, Paul+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE &amp; ECONOMICS+JAN 2010::Bayesian analysis of DSGE models+An, Sungbae; Schorfheide, Frank+ECONOMETRIC REVIEWS+2007::Predictive bayesian model selection+Ando, T.+Am.

A Note on the Regularized Approach to Biased 2SLS Estimation with Weak Instruments,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12144,DEC 2016,19,0,"The presence of weak instruments is translated into a nearly singular problem in a control function representation. Therefore, the L2-norm type of regularization is proposed to implement the 2SLS estimation for addressing the weak instrument problem. The L2-norm regularization with a regularized parameter O(n) allows us to obtain the Rothenberg (1984) type of higher-order approximation of the 2SLS estimator in the weak instrument asymptotic framework. The proposed regularized parameter yields the regularized concentration parameter O(n), which is used as a standardized factor in the higher-order approximation. We also show that the proposed L2-norm regularization consequently reduces the finite sample bias. A number of existing estimators that address finite sample bias in the presence of weak instruments, especially Fuller's limited information maximum likelihood estimator, are compared with our proposed estimator in a simple Monte Carlo exercise.",,"VARIABLES ESTIMATION,APPROXIMATIONS,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE","Kim, Namhyun@Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Rennes Dr, Exeter, Devon, England::Pohlmeier, Winfried@Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Kim, Namhyun@University of Exeter::Pohlmeier, Winfried@University of Konstanz",not exist,"ESTIMATION OF THE PARAMETERS OF A SINGLE EQUATION IN A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS+ANDERSON, TW; RUBIN, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1949::Jackknife instrumental variables estimation+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Krueger, AB+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1999::A solution to the weak instrument bias in 2SLS estimation: Indirect inference with stochastic approximation+Arel-Bundock, Vincent+ECONOMICS LETTERS+SEP 2013::ALTERNATIVE APPROXIMATIONS TO THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATORS+BEKKER, PA+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1994::Small sample properties of LIML and jackknife IV estimators: Experiments with weak instruments+Blomquist, S; Dahlberg, M+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1999::PROBLEMS WITH INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES ESTIMATION WHEN THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE INSTRUMENTS AND THE ENDOGENOUS EXPLANATORY VARIABLE IS WEAK+BOUND, J; JAEGER, DA; BAKER, RM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::A comparison of bias approximations for the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator+Bun, Maurice J.

A Method for Working with Sign Restrictions in Structural Equation Modelling,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12137,OCT 2016,23,1,The paper sets out a method for handling sign restrictions in systems of simultaneous equations which are only partially identified. These sign restrictions might apply to either structural equation parameters or functions of them such as impulse responses. Initially a range of values for the unidentified parameters are generated and then the role of sign restrictions is to narrow the range. It is simple to apply and can be handled in packages such as EViews and Stata. Examples are given of how to implement it in a number of cases where there are both parametric and sign restrictions.,,"AGNOSTIC IDENTIFICATION,VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIONS,MONETARY-POLICY,DISTURBANCES,FLUCTUATIONS","Ouliaris, Sam@Int Monetary Fund, Inst Capac Dev, Washington, DC 20431 USA::Pagan, Adrian@Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Modelling, Melbourne, Vic, Australia@Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Ouliaris, Sam@International Monetary Fund::Pagan, Adrian@University of Melbourne@University of Sydney",not exist,"no title+Amisano, G.; Giannini, C.+TOPICS STRUCTURAL VA+1997::no title+Arias, J.

Misspecification and Expectations Correction in New Keynesian DSGE Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12126,OCT 2016,70,0,"This paper focuses on the dynamic misspecification that characterizes the class of small-scale New Keynesian models currently used in monetary and business cycle analysis, and provides a remedy for the typical difficulties these models have in accounting for the rich contemporaneous and dynamic correlation structure of the data. We suggest using a statistical model for the data as a device through which it is possible to adapt the econometric specification of the New Keynesian model such that the risk of omitting important propagation mechanisms is kept under control. A pseudo-structural form is built from the baseline system of Euler equations by forcing the state vector of the system to have the same dimension as the state vector characterizing the statistical model. The pseudo-structural formgives rise to a set of cross-equation restrictions that do not penalize the autocorrelation structure and persistence of the data. Standard estimation and evaluation methods can be used. We provide an empirical illustration based on USA quarterly data and a small-scale monetary New Keynesian model.",,"GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM-MODELS,QUASI-RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS,MONETARY-POLICY RULES,MACROECONOMIC STABILITY,STICKY INFORMATION,PHILLIPS-CURVE,INFERENCE,REPRESENTATIONS,IDENTIFICATION,INDETERMINACY","Angelini, Giovanni@Univ Bologna, Sch Econ Management & Stat, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy::Fanelli, Luca@Univ Bologna, Sch Econ Management & Stat, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy","Angelini, Giovanni@University of Bologna::Fanelli, Luca@University of Bologna","ANGELINI, GIOVANNI@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3000-9885","Bayesian analysis of DSGE models+An, Sungbae; Schorfheide, Frank+ECONOMETRIC REVIEWS+2007::How to Maximize the Likelihood Function for a DSGE Model+Andreasen, Martin Moller+COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS+FEB 2010::Maximum likelihood inference in weakly identified dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models+Andrews, Isaiah; Mikusheva, Anna+QUANTITATIVE ECONOMICS+MAR 2015::Frequentist Evaluation of Small DSGE Models+Bardsen, Gunnar; Fanelli, Luca+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 3 2015::VAR Analysis and the Great Moderation+Benati, Luca; Surico, Paolo+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 2009::Factor analysis in a model with rational expectations+Beyer, Andreas; Farmer, Roger E.

Do Good Institutions Promote Countercyclical Macroeconomic Policies?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12132,OCT 2016,44,4,"The literature has argued that developing countries are unable to adopt countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies due to financial imperfections and unfavourable political-economy conditions. Using a world sample of up to 112 industrial and developing countries for 1984-2008, we find that the level of institutional quality plays a key role in countries' ability and willingness to implement countercyclical macroeconomic policies. Countries with strong (weak) institutions adopt countercyclical (procyclical) macroeconomic policies, reflected in extended monetary policy and fiscal policy rules. The threshold levels of institutional quality at which policies are acyclical are found to be similar for monetary and fiscal policy.",,"FISCAL-POLICY,DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES,BUSINESS CYCLES,MONETARY-POLICY,LATIN-AMERICA,PROCYCLICALITY,VOLATILITY,QUALITY,RULES","Calderon, Cesar@World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA::Duncan, Roberto@Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, Bentley Annex 349, Athens, OH 45701 USA::Schmidt-Hebbel, Klaus@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile","Calderon, Cesar@The World Bank::Duncan, Roberto@Ohio University::Schmidt-Hebbel, Klaus@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile",not exist,"Institutional causes, macroeconomic symptoms: volatility, crises and growth+Acemoglu, D; Johnson, S; Robinson, J; et al.+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+JAN 2003::Why is fiscal policy often procyclical?+Alesina, Alberto; Campante, Filipe R.; Tabellini, Guido+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION+SEP 2008::no title+ARELLANO M+THE REVIEW OF ECONOM+1991::Measuring business cycles: Approximate band-pass filters for economic time series+Baxter, M; King, RG+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1999::Financial openness and the Chinese growth experience+Bekaert, C.; Harvey, R.; Lundblad, C.+China's Financial Transition at a Cross- Roads+2007::no title+Braun, M.+Why is Fiscal Policy Procyclical in Developing Countries?+2001::Macroeconomic policies and performance in Latin America+Calderon, C; Schmidt-Hebbel, K+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+DEC 2003::The role of credibility in the cyclical properties of macroeconomic policies in emerging economies+Calderon, U; Duncan, R; Schmidt-Hebbel, K+REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS+2004::no title+CALVO GA+REFORMING INT MONETA+2000::Optimal simple rules for the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy+Chadha, Jagjit S.; Nolan, Charles+JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS+DEC 2007::Didier T+De la Torre, A.; Calderon, C.; Pienknagura, S.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Cordella, T.; Aedo, C.; Walker, I</span>.+LAC's Long- Term Growth: Made in China?+2011::Institutional quality, the cyclicality of monetary policy and macroeconomic volatility+Duncan, Roberto+JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS+MAR 2014::On graduation from fiscal procyclicality+Frankel, Jeffrey A.; Vegh, Carlos A.; Vuletin, Guillermo+JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS+JAN 2013::no title+GALI J+ECON POLICY+2003::Fiscal policy in Latin America+Gavin, M; Perotti, R+NBER MACROECONOMICS ANNUAL 1997+1997::Fiscal policy and private saving in Latin America in good times and bad+Gavin, M.; Perotti, R.+Promoting Savings in Latin America+1997::no title+Hausmann, R.; Stein, E.+Searching for the Right Budgetary Institutions for a Volatile Region+1996::Postwar US business cycles: An empirical investigation+Hodrick, RJ; Prescott, EC+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+FEB 1997::Monetary policies for developing countries: The role of institutional quality+Huang, Haizhou; Wei, Shang-Jin+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+SEP 2006::Procyclical Fiscal Policy: Truth or Fiction?+Ilzetzki, E.; Vegh, C.

Macroeconomic Uncertainty and Oil Price Volatility,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12124,OCT 2016,48,4,"This paper shows that higher macroeconomic uncertainty causes higher oil price volatility. Regimes of low and high uncertainty are identified in a threshold VAR model in which the effects of structural oil demand and supply shocks are estimated. The results show that higher macroeconomic uncertainty, as measured by global industrial production volatility, significantly increases the sensitivity of oil prices to shocks in oil demand and supply. This occurs as uncertainty lowers the price elasticity of oil demand and supply. The difference in the estimated oil price elasticities is economically meaningful as the price impact of a similar change in oil production might double when it hits the economy in uncertain times. As such, varying uncertainty can explain why oil price volatility is typically higher during periods such as financial crises and recessions, and why oil price volatility changes over time more generally.",,"ECONOMIC-ACTIVITY,SUPPLY SHOCKS,INVESTMENT,MARKET,IRREVERSIBILITY,DEMAND,DYNAMICS","Van Robays, Ine@European Cent Bank, Sonnemanstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany","Van Robays, Ine@European Central Bank",not exist,"Optimal capital policy with irreversible investment+Arrow, K.+Value, capital, and growth, papers in honour of Sir John Hicks+1968::Credit and economic activity: Credit regimes and nonlinear propagation of shocks+Balke, NS+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 2000::Do we really know that oil caused the great stagflation?

Social Capital and Economic Growth in Europe: Nonlinear Trends and Heterogeneous Regional Effects,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12131,OCT 2016,76,1,"Most of the literature focused on the social capital-growth nexus has followed the one-size-fits-all approach, neglecting that regional disparities might modify this relationship. This article analyses the role of two social capital indicators on the growth of 237 European regions in the period 1995-2007 by implementing non-parametric regression, which relaxes the linearity assumption and allows the data to give the underlying functional form. The results show that social capital effects on growth are nonlinear. Parameter heterogeneity could also be examined, showing heterogenous effects across regions and over time. In particular, social capital is mostly negative in regions from Eastern and Central Europe during the first years of transition from socialism to market economies.

An IV Test for a Unit Root in Generally Trending and Correlated Panels,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12141,OCT 2016,20,0,"This paper proposes an IV-based panel unit root test that is general enough to accommodate general error serial and cross-section dependence, and a potentially nonlinear deterministic trend function. These allowances make the new test one of the most general around. It is also very simple to implement. Indeed, the IV statistic is asymptotically invariant to not only to all nuisance parameters characterizing the dependence of the errors and the true trend function, but also the deterministic specification of the fitted test regression.",,"RECURSIVE MEAN ADJUSTMENT,CROSS-SECTION DEPENDENCE,FACTOR MODELS","Westerlund, Joakim@Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden@Deakin Univ, Ctr Financial Econometr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Westerlund, Joakim@Deakin University@Lund University",not exist,"Inference withWeak Instruments+Andrews, D.

Our strategy follows the literature that tests the constraints imposed by optimality on the evolution of individual consumption. The introduction of habits and envy places additional restrictions on the evolution of the optimal consumption path. We use a unique data set to test these restrictions. Our estimates suggest that, if one defines utility over consumption services, a large fraction of these services is relative, with one third of the weight placed in the consumption of the reference group and another third placed in the agent's past consumption.",,"LIFE-CYCLE MODEL,RELATIVE INCOME,CONSUMPTION EXTERNALITIES,CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION,BUSINESS-CYCLE,ASSET PRICES,GROWTH,PERSISTENCE,JONESES,NEIGHBORS","Alvarez-Cuadrado, Francisco@McGill Univ, 855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada::Maria Casado, Jose@Banco Espana, Madrid 28014, Spain::Maria Labeaga, Jose@UNED, Madrid 28040, Spain","Alvarez-Cuadrado, Francisco@McGill University::Maria Casado, Jose@Unknow::Maria Labeaga, Jose@Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED)",not exist,"ASSET PRICES UNDER HABIT FORMATION AND CATCHING UP WITH THE JONESES+ABEL, AB+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAY 1990::THE FAIR WAGE-EFFORT HYPOTHESIS AND UNEMPLOYMENT+AKERLOF, GA; YELLEN, YL+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1990::Aspirations, habit formation, and bequest motive+Alonso-Carrera, Jaime; Caballe, Jordi; Raurich, Xavier+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+APR 2007::How much do we care about absolute versus relative income and consumption?+Alpizar, F; Carlsson, F; Johansson-Stenman, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR &amp; ORGANIZATION+MAR 2005::HOUSEHOLD CHOICES IN EQUILIBRIUM+ALTUG, S; MILLER, RA+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1990::The relative income hypothesis+Alvarez-Cuadrado, Francisco; Ngo Van Long+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+SEP 2011::Envy and Inequality+Alvarez-Cuadrado, Francisco; Ngo Van Long+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+2012::Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricists Companion+Angrist, JD; Pischke, JS+MOSTLY HARMLESS ECONOMETRICS: AN EMPIRICISTS COMPANION+2009::The Perils of Peer Effects+Angrist, Joshua.+NBER working paper 19774+2013::ANOTHER LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+ARELLANO, M; BOVER, O+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1995::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::Conspicuous Consumption, Inconspicuous Leisure*+Arrow, Kenneth J.; Dasgupta, Partha S.+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+NOV 2009::Chapter 11 Consumption+ATTANASIO, O.

Is There Catch-Up Growth? Evidence from Three Continents,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12117,AUG 2016,58,1,"The ability to correct deficiencies in early childhood malnutrition, what is known as catch-up growth, has widespread consequences for economic and social development. While clinical evidence of catch-up has been observed, less clear is the ability to correct for chronic malnutrition found in impoverished environments in the absence of extensive and focused interventions. This paper investigates whether nutritional status at early age affects nutritional status a few years later among children, using panel data from China, South Africa and Nicaragua. The key research question is the extent to which state dependence in linear growth exists among young children, and what family and community level factors mediate state dependency. The answer to this question is crucial for public policy due to the long-term economic consequences of poor childhood nutrition. Results show strong but not perfect persistence in nutritional status across all countries, indicating that catch-up growth is possible though unobserved household behaviours tend to worsen the possibility of catch-up growth. Public policy that can influence these behaviours, especially when children are under 24 months old, can significantly alter nutrition outcomes in South Africa and Nicaragua.",,"CHILD HEALTH PRODUCTION,PANEL-DATA MODELS,INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES,LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS,DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES,NUTRITIONAL-STATUS,DETERMINANTS,CONSEQUENCES,MALNUTRITION,REGRESSION","Handa, Sudhanshu@Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, CB 3435 Abernathy Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA@UNICEF Off Res Innocenti, I-50122 Florence, Italy::Peterman, Amber@UNICEF Off Res Innocenti, I-50122 Florence, Italy","Handa, Sudhanshu@University of North Carolina@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill::Peterman, Amber@Unknow",not exist,"Filipino children exhibit catch-up growth from age 2-12 years+Adair, L.

Productivity Spillovers Across Countries and Industries: New Evidence From OECD Countries,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12122,AUG 2016,49,3,"This paper uses a translog approach to estimate intra- and inter-industry productivity spillovers transmitted through input-output linkages, distinguishing R&D and other (remainder) spillovers. For a panel of 12 OECD countries and 15 manufacturing industries from 1995-2005, first, we find that the estimated elasticity with respect to own' R&D amounts to 0.25 on average (which would be estimated to be lower if R&D were assumed to be additively separable from other inputs). Second, there are sizeable intra-industry and relatively small inter-industry R&D spillovers. Third, there are significant remainder spillovers, which are mainly of the intra-industry type and substantially amplify idiosyncratic technology shocks.",,"RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT,SPATIAL AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS,FIRM-LEVEL EVIDENCE,UNITED-STATES,PLANT-LEVEL,TECHNOLOGY,GROWTH,TRADE,INVESTMENT,PANEL","Badinger, Harald@Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria::Egger, Peter@Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Econ, KOF, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Badinger, Harald@Vienna University of Economics & Business::Egger, Peter@ETH Zurich",not exist,"Do domestic firms benefit from direct foreign investment?

We provide more systematic empirical evidence than available hitherto for OECD countries, obtaining strong evidence that reallocating total spending towards infrastructure and education is positive for long-run output levels. Reallocating spending towards social welfare (and away from all other expenditure categories pro-rata) may be associated with modest negative effects on output in the long run.",,"DYNAMIC HETEROGENEOUS PANELS,ENDOGENOUS GROWTH-MODEL,FISCAL-POLICY,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,OECD COUNTRIES,PUBLIC-EXPENDITURE,ERROR-CORRECTION,TERM GROWTH,CONVERGENCE,COINTEGRATION","Gemmell, Norman@Victoria Univ Wellington, Victoria Business Sch, Wellington, New Zealand::Kneller, Richard@Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England::Sanz, Ismael@Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain","Gemmell, Norman@Victoria University Wellington::Kneller, Richard@University of Nottingham::Sanz, Ismael@Universidad Rey Juan Carlos","Kneller, Richard@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4542-5358","Can a government enhance long-run growth by changing the composition of public expenditure?+Acosta-Ormaechea, S; Morozumi, A.+IMF Working Paper, No. WP/13/162.+2013::Fiscal deficits and growth in developing countries+Adam, CS; Bevan, DL+JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS+APR 2005::Fiscal composition and long-term growth+Afonso, Antonio; Jalles, Joao Tovar+APPLIED ECONOMICS+JAN 22 2014::no title+Agenor, P.-R.+Public capital, growth and welfare+2012::no title+Agenor, P.

Students leaving primary for secondary school experience a big change in their peer group and these changes vary randomly from cohort to cohort. We exploit this variation to identify the effect of new peers on student achievement. We show that peer quality on entry to secondary school has a significant effect on students' subsequent achievement at age 14. The effect sizes are relatively small and are linked to peers' family background and early age achievements.",,"AFFECT STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT,SOCIAL INTERACTIONS,MATTER,INCENTIVES,BEHAVIOR,OUTCOMES,SMOKING","Gibbons, Stephen@London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England@London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England::Telhaj, Shqiponja@London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England@Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England","Gibbons, Stephen@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London::Telhaj, Shqiponja@London School Economics & Political Science@University of Sussex@University of London","Gibbons, Stephen@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2871-8562","Peers, schools, and adolescent cigarette smoking+Alexander, C; Piazza, M; Mekos, D; et al.+JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH+JUL 2001::Selection on observed and unobserved variables: Assessing the effectiveness of Catholic schools+Altonji, JG; Elder, TE; Taber, CR+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+FEB 2005::Peer Effects in European Primary Schools: Evidence from the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study+Ammermueller, Andreas; Pischke, Joern-Steffen+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JUL 2009::The influence of peer interactions on sexually oriented joke telling+Angelone, DJ; Hirschman, R; Suniga, S; et al.+SEX ROLES+FEB 2005::Does school integration generate peer effects?

To What Extent Does the Interest Burden Affect Firm Survival? Evidence from a Panel of UK Firms during the Recent Financial Crisis,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12120,AUG 2016,44,4,"Using a panel of mainly unquoted UK firms over the period 2000-09, we document a significant effect of changes in the interest burden from debt-servicing on firm survival. The effect is found to be stronger during the recent financial crisis compared with more tranquil periods. Furthermore, the survival chances of bank-dependent, younger, and non-exporting firms are most affected by changes in the interest burden, especially during the crisis. Our results are robust to using different estimation methods and different interest burden measures They suggest that one way for policymakers to mitigate the effects of financial crises by limiting firm failures would be to prevent financing costs from rising, especially for those firms more likely to face liquidity constraints.",,"MONETARY-POLICY,INVENTORY INVESTMENT,GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT,CREDIT CHANNEL,MICRO DATA,CONSTRAINTS,PRESSURE","Guariglia, Alessandra@Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England::Spaliara, Marina-Eliza@Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Dept Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland::Tsoukas, Serafeim@Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Dept Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Guariglia, Alessandra@University of Birmingham::Spaliara, Marina-Eliza@University of Glasgow::Tsoukas, Serafeim@University of Glasgow",not exist,"Corporate liquidity management: A conceptual framework and survey+Almeida, H.; Campello, M.; Cuhna, I.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Weisbach, M</span>.+Working paper 19502+2013::Foreign acquisition, plant survival, and employment growth+Bandick, Roger; Goerg, Holger+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE+MAY 2010::no title+no author+Inflation Report+2012::no title+no author+Trends in Lending+2009::Understanding the weakness of bank lending+Bell, V.; Young, G.+Quarterly Bulletin+2010::Financial pressure, monetary policy effects and inventories: Firm-level evidence from a market-based and a bank-based financial system+Benito, A+ECONOMICA+MAY 2005::The impact of the financial crisis on supply+Benito, A.; Nelss, K.; Price, S.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rachel, K</span>.+Quarterly Bulletin+2010::Financial pressure and balance sheet adjustment by firms+Benito, Andrew; Young, Garry+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+OCT 2007::The financial accelerator and the flight to quality+Bernanke, B; Gertler, M; Gilchrist, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1996::INSIDE THE BLACK-BOX - THE CREDIT CHANNEL OF MONETARY-POLICY TRANSMISSION+BERNANKE, BS; GERTLER, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+FAL 1995::Financial constraints, global engagement, and firm survival in the United Kingdom: Evidence from micro data+Bridges, Sarah; Guariglia, Alessandra+SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+SEP 2008::Company Accounts Based Modelling of Business Failures and the Implications for Financial Stability+Bunn, P.; Redwood, V.+Bank of England Working Paper No 210+2003::Small Firms in the Credit Crisis: Evidence from the UK Survey of SME Finances+Fraser, S.+ESRC grant no.

We find that inequality in earnings among employees has risen fairly steadily since 1978, but other factors that caused income inequality to rise before 1991 have since gone into reverse. Inequality in investment and pension income has fallen since 1991, as has inequality between those with and without employment. Furthermore, certain household types - notably the elderly and those with young children - which had relatively low incomes in the period to 1991 have seen their incomes converge with others.",,"COMPLEX SURVEY DATA,VARIANCE-ESTIMATION,EARNINGS,TAX","Brewer, Mike@Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England::Wren-Lewis, Liam@Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France","Brewer, Mike@University of Essex::Wren-Lewis, Liam@Paris School of Economics","Wren-Lewis, Liam@L-6316-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3739-5328::Brewer, Mike@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0759-0384","no title+Adam, S; Browne, J.+Redistribution, work incentives and thirty years of UK tax and benefit reform, IFS Working Paper 10/24+2010::The Distribution of Top Earnings in the UK since the Second World War+Atkinson, A.

Credit constraints have a negative relationship with dropout, especially on lower achieving high school graduates. Credit constrained students with strong high school achievement are 13-15% more (less) likely to graduate (be slow finishers) relative to otherwise similar students who are potentially or unlikely constrained. Using competing risk analysis, we find dropout is most likely in the first year of study and falls over time for all students. After 3 years of study, the risk of dropout increases for students who are constrained suggesting constraints may eventually bind on these students.",,"BORROWING CONSTRAINTS,COLLEGE COMPLETION,EDUCATION,DURATION,DECISION,STUDENTS,ABILITY,MODELS,SCHOOL,UK","Cardak, Buly A.@La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia::Vecci, Joe@Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Cardak, Buly A.@La Trobe University::Vecci, Joe@Monash University","Cardak, Buly@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1323-5055","Discrete-time methods for the analysis of event histories+Allison, P.

These are the CADF and CIPS test statistics, which are amongst the most popular test statistics in the literature. One feature of these statistics is that their limiting distributions are highly non-standard, making for relatively complicated implementation.

A Simple Panel Unit-Root Test with Smooth Breaks in the Presence of a Multifactor Error Structure,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12109,JUN 2016,34,6,"This paper extends the cross-sectionally augmented panel unit-root test (CIPS) developed by Pesaran etal. (2013, Journal of Econometrics, Vol. 175, pp. 94-115) to allow for smoothing structural changes in deterministic terms modelled by a Fourier function. The proposed statistic is called the break augmented CIPS (BCIPS) statistic.

A Note on the Identification of Dynamic Economic Models with Generalized Shock Processes,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12115,JUN 2016,26,0,"Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models with generalized shock processes, such as shock processes which follow a vector autoregression (VAR), have been an active area of research in recent years. Unfortunately, the structural parameters governing DSGE models are not identified when the driving process behind the model follows an unrestricted VAR. This finding implies that parameter estimates derived from recent attempts to estimate DSGE models with generalized driving processes should be treated with caution, and that there always exists a tradeoff between identification and the risk of model misspecification. However, these results also make it easier to address the issue of model misspecification by making it computationally easier to check the validity of cross-equation restrictions.",,"DSGE MODELS,EQUILIBRIUM-MODELS,FRICTIONS,VARS","Reicher, Claire A.@Inst Weltwirtschaft, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany","Reicher, Claire A.@Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW)",not exist,"Bayesian analysis of DSGE models+An, Sungbae; Schorfheide, Frank+ECONOMETRIC REVIEWS+2007::News shocks and business cycles+Barsky, Robert B.; Sims, Eric R.+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+APR 2011::Back to square one: Identification issues in DSGE models+Canova, Fabio; Sala, Luca+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 2009::Business cycle accounting+Chari, V.

Regression-Kink Approach for Wage Effect on Male Work Hours,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12112,JUN 2016,20,0,"In finding the effect of after-tax wage rate on work hours, the main difficulty is the endogeneity of after-tax wage rate that equals one minus average tax rate' times wage rate. To overcome this endogeneity problem, we take advantage of jumps in the marginal income tax rate, which is a regression discontinuity (RD) idea. This RD, in turn, makes the average income tax rate kink-continuous', which is a regression kink (RK) idea. We provide a simple economic model resulting in the RD and RK features, explain how to implement RK in practice, and then apply our methods to Korean male data. Our main RK-based labour supply elasticity estimate 7.16% turned out to be insignificant with t-value 1.52, but it is much larger than most estimates in the literature. This may be attributed to, among other things, the facts that the RK instrument is unique, that RK identifies only the local elasticity at the kink point and that RK requires large data as regression derivatives are estimated.",,"DISCONTINUITY DESIGNS,LABOR,ELASTICITIES,TAXES","Kim, Young-sook@Korean Womens Dev Inst, Seoul 122707, South Korea::Lee, Myoung-jae@Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea","Kim, Young-sook@Unknow::Lee, Myoung-jae@Korea University",not exist,"[not available]+ALTONJI JG+J POLITICAL EC+1986::Alternative Approaches to Evaluation in Empirical Microeconomics+Blundell, Richard; Dias, Monica Costa+JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES+SUM 2009::Labor supply: A review of alternative approaches+Blundell, Richard; Thomas, MaCurdy.+HDB LABOR EC A+1999::EFFECT OF TAXATION ON LABOR SUPPLY - EVALUATING THE GARY NEGATIVE INCOME-TAX EXPERIMENT+BURTLESS, G; HAUSMAN, JA+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1978::no title+Cahuc, Pierre; Carcillo, Stephane; Zylberberg, Andre.+Labor Economics+2014::Nonlinear policy rules and the identification and estimation of causal effects in a generalized regression kink design+Card,, D.; Lee,, D.; Pei,, Z.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Weber,, A</span>.+NBER Working Paper No . 18564+2012::The labor-supply elasticity and borrowing constraints: Why estimates are biased+Domeij, D; Floden, M+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS+APR 2006::Taxes and Labor Supply.+Hausman, J.+HDB PUBLIC EC+1985::Labor Supply+Hausman, J.

We take careful account of prices, demographics, labour supply and health. Demand for consumer electronics rises with age, while the demand for household appliances is flat. These findings contrast with the well documented decline in non-durable consumption at older ages, and suggest that studies that estimate the overall discount rate from nondurable consumption may underestimate consumer patience and the savings required to fund retirement.

The Effect of Import Competition on Firm Productivity and Innovation: Does the Distance to Technology Frontier Matter?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12110,APR 2016,53,3,"How does foreign competition affect growth and innovation in China? Using our unique measures of proximity of Chinese firms and industries to the world technology frontier, we find that despite vast sectoral heterogeneity, Chinese manufacturing industries have undergone rapid technological upgrading over the period of 2000-06. The distance to the world production frontier of firms and industries plays an important role in shaping the nexus between the competition pressure from foreign imports and domestic firms' growth and innovation behaviour. Our results support the theoretical predictions of Aghion etal. (2005, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, pp. 701-728) that import competition stimulates the domestic firms' productivity growth and R&D expenditure if firms and their industries are close to the world frontier, but discourages such incentives for laggard firms and industries. The two forces highlighted by the model operate for imports under the ordinary-trade regime, for collective and private firms, and for imports originated from high-income countries. Our findings are robust after controlling the influence of foreign investment, the reverse causality of regressors and the short-term business cycle fluctuations.",,"FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT,US MANUFACTURING PLANTS,TRADE LIBERALIZATION,LEVEL PRODUCTIVITY,UPGRADING EVIDENCE,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,CHINA,SPILLOVERS,INDUSTRIES,SELECTION","Ding, Sai@Univ Glasgow, Dept Econ, Adam Smith Business Sch, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland::Sun, Puyang@Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Jiang, Wei@Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China","Ding, Sai@University of Glasgow::Sun, Puyang@Nankai University::Jiang, Wei@Nankai University",not exist,"Distance to frontier, selection, and economic growth+Acemoglu, D; Aghion, P; Zilibotti, F+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION+MAR 2006::Directed technical change+Acemoglu, D+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+OCT 2002::Competition and innovation: An inverted-U relationship+Aghion, P; Bloom, N; Blundell, R; et al.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 2005::THE EFFECTS OF ENTRY ON INCUMBENT INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY+Aghion, Philippe; Blundell, Richard; Griffith, Rachel; et al.+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2009::The role of intermediaries in facilitating trade+Ahn, JaeBin; Khandelwal, Amit K.; Wei, Shang-Jin+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+MAY 2011::Trade liberalization, intermediate inputs, and productivity: Evidence from Indonesia+Amiti, Mary; Konings, Jozef+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 2007::IMPORT COMPETITION AND QUALITY UPGRADING+Amiti, Mary; Khandelwal, Amit K.+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 2013::R&amp;D Investment, Exporting, and Productivity Dynamics+Aw, Bee Yan; Roberts, Mark J.; Xu, Daniel Yi+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2011::Cross-Country Differences in Productivity: The Role of Allocation and Selection+Bartelsman, Eric; Haltiwanger, John; Scarpetta, Stefano+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+FEB 2013::How do Different Exporters React to Exchange Rate Changes?+Berman, Nicolas; Martin, Philippe; Mayer, Thierry+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2012::Survival of the best fit: Exposure to low-wage countries and the (uneven) growth of US manufacturing plants+Bernard, AB; Jensen, JB; Schott, PK+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+JAN 2006::Welfare gains from Foreign Direct Investment through technology transfer to local suppliers+Blalock, Garrick; Gertler, Paul J.+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS+MAR 2008::Trapped Factors and China's Impact on Global Growth+Bloom, N.+CEP Discussion Paper No 1261+2014::Trade Induced Technical Change?

Gaps between scores of black and white children remain constant, narrow, or disappear entirely as children grow older, depending upon the measure and the family structure. Income elasticities are higher for children of black families, and there are differences in elasticities with respect to parents' educational levels. The effects of fathers' and mothers' educational levels differ. Between children of two-parent families and mother-only families, there is a gap that is at least as important as the racial gap.",,"CHILD-DEVELOPMENT,PREMARKET FACTORS","Creel, Michael@Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Edifici B, E-08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain::Farell, Montserrat@Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Edifici B, E-08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain","Creel, Michael@Autonomous University of Barcelona::Farell, Montserrat@Autonomous University of Barcelona","Creel, Michael@K-2178-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0944-8405","Can flexible non-linear modeling tell us anything new about educational productivity?+Baker, BD+ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW+FEB 2001::PRODUCTION OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND LIFE CYCLE OF EARNINGS+BENPORATH, Y+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+1967::The effect of income on child development+Blau, DM+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 1999::no title+no author+NLS HDB 2001+2001::no title+Cameron, A; Trived, P.+Microeconometrics+2005::Labor market discrimination and racial differences in premarket factors+Carneiro, P; Heckman, JJ; Masterov, DV+JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; ECONOMICS+APR 2005::GLOBAL PROPERTIES OF FLEXIBLE FUNCTIONAL FORMS+CAVES, DW; CHRISTENSEN, LR+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1980::Modified Hausman tests for inefficient estimators+Creel, M.+Applied Economics+2004::Understanding the black-white test score gap in the first two years of school+Fryer, J.; Roland, G.; Levitt, S.

The Effect of Bar Hours Regulation on Worker Absence",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12106,APR 2016,35,0,"The regulation of alcohol availability has the potential to influence worker productivity. This paper uses legislative changes in bar opening hours to provide a potential quasi-natural experiment of the effect of alcohol availability on working effort, focusing on worker absenteeism. We examine two recent policy changes, one in England/Wales and one in Spain that increased and decreased opening hours respectively. We demonstrate a robust positive causal link between opening hours and absenteeism, although short-lived for Spain. The effect is long lasting for the UK where we provide evidence which suggests that increased alcohol consumption is a key mechanism.",,"EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION,ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION,SALES RESTRICTIONS,TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS,SICKNESS ABSENCE,LABOR-MARKET,HEALTH,IMPACT,CRIME,ABSENTEEISM","Green, Colin P.@Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England::Paniagua, Maria Navarro@Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England","Green, Colin P.@Lancaster University::Paniagua, Maria Navarro@Lancaster University","Green, Colin@K-3966-2012::Navarro Paniagua, Maria@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4855-0135::Green, Colin@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6156-4676","The economic costs of conflict: A case study of the Basque Country+Abadie, A; Gardeazabal, J+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 2003::Alcohol and Global Health 2 Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies and programmes to reduce the harm caused by alcohol+Anderson, Peter; Chisholm, Dan; Fuhr, Daniela C.+LANCET+JUN-JUL 2009::Luck, effort, and reward in an organizational hierarchy+Audas, R; Barmby, T; Treble, J+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+APR 2004::Outsourcing at will: The contribution of unjust dismissal doctrine to the growth of employment outsourcing+Autor, DH+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JAN 2003::Measuring positive externalities from unobservable victim precaution: An empirical analysis of Lojack+Ayres, I; Levitt, SD+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 1998::ALCOHOL USE AND THE LABOR MARKET IN URUGUAY+Balsa, Ana I.; French, Michael T.+HEALTH ECONOMICS+JUL 2010::Sickness absence: An international comparison+Barmby, TA; Ercolani, MG; Treble, JG+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JUN 2002::WORKER ABSENTEEISM - AN ANALYSIS USING MICRODATA+BARMBY, TA; ORME, CD; TREBLE, JG+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+MAR 1991::Do consumers exploit precommitment opportunities?

Domestic Violence and Football in Glasgow: Are Reference Points Relevant?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12105,FEB 2016,18,0,"A growing body of evidence suggests that people exhibit loss aversion - the displeasure from suffering a loss is larger than the pleasure enjoyed from an equivalent-sized gain - and that expectations are important in determining what is perceived as a loss. Recent research suggests that disappointing results in sporting fixtures relative to prematch expectations play an important role in triggering domestic violence (Card and Dahl, 2011), consistent with the idea of loss aversion around expectations-based reference points. This paper seeks to investigate whether such behaviour is exhibited by football fans in Glasgow by looking at the relationship between match outcomes relative to expectations and levels of domestic violence using a data set that contains every domestic violence incident in Glasgow over a period of more than eight years. Whilst we find that when the 'Old-Firm' Glasgow rivals Celtic and Rangers play there are large increases in domestic violence (regardless of the outcome of the match), in other matches disappointing results relative to expectations are not linked to increased domestic violence, except when those matches occur at the very end of the season where the title is still being contended.",,"DISAPPOINTMENT,FRUSTRATION,UNCERTAINTY,DECISION,AVERSION,CRIME","Dickson, Alex@Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland::Jennings, Colin@Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England::Koop, Gary@Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland","Dickson, Alex@University of Strathclyde::Jennings, Colin@Kings College London@University of London::Koop, Gary@University of Strathclyde","Jennings, Colin@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5554-3825","The economic impact of regular season sporting competitions: the Glasgow old firm football spectators as sports tourists.+Allan, G.; Dunlop, S.; Swales, K.+Journal of Sport Tourism+2007::DISAPPOINTMENT IN DECISION-MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY+BELL, DE+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+1985::FAMILY VIOLENCE AND FOOTBALL: THE EFFECT OF UNEXPECTED EMOTIONAL CUES ON VIOLENT BEHAVIOR+Card, David; Dahl, Gordon B.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2011::Impelling and inhibiting forces in the perpetration of intimate partner violence+Finkel, Eli J.+REVIEW OF GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY+JUN 2007::Televised NFL games, the family, and domestic violence+Gantz, W.; Wang, Z.; Bradley, S.

AnAnalysis of Consumer Response to Corruption: Italy's Calciopoli Scandal,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12094,FEB 2016,25,4,"The Calciopoli episode affecting Italian football in the 2005-6 season serves as an opportunity for an empirical investigation into consumer (fan) behavior, following league-imposed punishments on clubs whose officials were found guilty of corrupt practices. Using a difference-in-differences estimation method, we find that home attendances for convicted teams fell by around 16%, relative to those clubs not subject to punishment. We show further that the fall in attendances resulted in non-trivial gate revenue reductions.

We then present a real business cycle model with a financial sector to investigate how the dynamics of macroeconomic aggregates and balance sheet variables of the US banks are influenced by empirically disciplined shocks to bank networth. Both calibrated and estimated versions of the model show that these financial shocks are important not only for explaining the dynamics of financial flows but also for the dynamics of macroeconomic variables. We find that the recent deterioration in aggregate net worth of the US banking sector contributed significantly to the 2007-09 recession.",,"MONETARY-POLICY,AGENCY COSTS,FRICTIONS","Mimir, Yasin@Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Istanbul Sch Cent Banking, Fener KalamIs Cad AtlIhan Sok 30-A KadIkoy, Istanbul, Turkey","Mimir, Yasin@Ministry of National Education - Turkey",not exist,"Liquidity and leverage+Adrian, T.; Shin, H.

Opt Out or Top Up?

We specify a joint model for public and private specialist visits counts, allowing for different degrees of endogenous supplementary insurance coverage. We find evidence of opting out: richer and wealthier individuals consume more private services and concomitantly reduce those services publicly provided through selection into for-profit VHI.

The Impact of Trade Liberalization on Micro Enterprises: Do Banks Matter? Evidence from Indian Manufacturing,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12082,DEC 2015,38,0,"This paper looks at the impact of trade liberalization on micro enterprises with differential access to banks. I use Indian data on rural micro enterprises employing less than ten workers in the manufacturing sector to find that trade liberalization, measured by a fall in the tariff, is associated with a larger increase or a smaller decrease in output, capital-labour ratio and labour productivity in districts with a larger number of bank branches per capita. Evidence is consistent with strong complementarities between trade liberalization effects, and the economic dynamism and access to financial intermediation associated with greater bank presence in the enterprise's location. The study underscores that trade liberalization can be beneficial to micro entrepreneurs under certain conditions and emphasizes reallocation resulting from trade liberalization. The study hence highlights the role for development policy in exploiting gains from trade.",,"PRODUCTIVITY,INDUSTRIES,SECTOR,REALLOCATIONS","Sundaram, Asha@Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa","Sundaram, Asha@University of Cape Town","Sundaram, Asha@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1864-8019","Technical efficiency of small-and medium-scale enterprises: evidence from a survey of enterprises in Tanzania+Admassie, A; Matambalya, F.A.S.T.+East.

"Identification in Structural Vector Autoregressive Models with Structural Changes, with an Application to US Monetary Policy",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12092,DEC 2015,47,4,"A growing line of research makes use of structural changes and different volatility regimes found in the data in a constructive manner to improve the identification of structural parameters in structural vector autoregressions (SVARs). A standard assumption made in the literature is that the reduced form unconditional error covariance matrix varies while the structural parameters remain constant. Under this hypothesis, it is possible to identify the SVAR without needing to resort to additional restrictions. With macroeconomic data, the assumption that the transmission mechanism of the shocks does not vary across volatility regimes is debatable. We derive novel necessary and sufficient rank conditions for local identification of SVARs, where both the error covariance matrix and the structural parameters are allowed to change across volatility regimes. Our approach generalizes the existing literature on identification through changes in volatility' to a broader framework and opens up interesting possibilities for practitioners. An empirical illustration focuses on a small monetary policy SVAR of the US economy and suggests that monetary policy has become more effective at stabilizing the economy since the 1980s.",,"PRICE PUZZLE,VOLATILITY,HETEROSCEDASTICITY,STABILITY,SHOCKS","Bacchiocchi, Emanuele@Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy::Fanelli, Luca@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy@Univ Bologna, Sch Econ Management & Stat, Bologna, Italy","Bacchiocchi, Emanuele@University of Milan::Fanelli, Luca@University of Bologna",not exist,"no title+Amisano, G.; Giannini, C.+TOPICS STRUCTURAL VA+1997::Gimme a Break!

Confidence Bands for Impulse Responses: Bonferroni vs. Wald,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12114,DEC 2015,25,4,"In impulse response analysis estimation uncertainty is typically displayed by constructing bands around estimated impulse response functions. If they are based on the joint asymptotic distribution possibly constructed with bootstrap methods in a frequentist framework, often individual confidence intervals are simply connected to obtain the bands. Such bands are known to be too narrow and have a joint coverage probability lower than the desired one. If instead the Wald statistic is used and the joint bootstrap distribution of the impulse response coefficient estimators is taken into account and mapped into the band, it is shown that such a band is typically rather conservative. It is argued that, by using the Bonferroni method, a band can often be obtained which is smaller than the Wald band.",,"BOOTSTRAP PREDICTION REGIONS,REJECTIVE MULTIPLE TEST,VECTOR AUTOREGRESSION","Luetkepohl, Helmut@DIW Berlin, D-10177 Berlin, Germany@Free Univ Berlin, D-10177 Berlin, Germany::Staszewska-Bystrova, Anna@Univ Lodz, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland::Winker, Peter@Univ Giessen, D-35390 Giessen, Germany","Luetkepohl, Helmut@Free University of Berlin@DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung::Staszewska-Bystrova, Anna@University of Lodz::Winker, Peter@Justus Liebig University Giessen","Winker, Peter@D-1389-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3412-4207::Staszewska-Bystrova, Anna@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3941-4986","Asymptotic results for generalized Wald tests+Andrews, D.

Labour Demand Adjustment: Does Foreign Ownership Matter?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12097,DEC 2015,36,0,"This paper examines whether multinationals differ in their employment adjustment from domestic companies, using a panel of 5,544 Belgian firms observed between 1998 and 2005. More precisely, we estimate labour adjustment costs by worker and firm types. We propose a new flexible specification that takes into account the role of firm size in adjustment costs. Our results indicate that adjusting white-collar employment is around half as costly for multinational firms (MNFs) as for domestic firms of the same size. The remaining differential in adjustment costs between MNFs and domestic firms might result, among other things, from multinationals' stronger bargaining power.",,"PANEL-DATA MODELS,FOOTLOOSE MULTINATIONALS,COSTS,FIRMS,DYNAMICS","Dhyne, Emmanuel@Natl Bank Belgium, Res Dept, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium@UMons, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium::Fuss, Catherine@Natl Bank Belgium, Res Dept, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium@Univ Libre Bruxelles, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium::Mathieu, Claude@Univ Paris Est Creteil, ERUDITE, F-94010 Creteil, France","Dhyne, Emmanuel@Unknow::Fuss, Catherine@Universite Libre de Bruxelles::Mathieu, Claude@University of Paris-Est Creteil",not exist,"The costs of hiring and separations+Abowd, JM; Kramarz, F+LABOUR ECONOMICS+OCT 2003::The effect of globalization on union bargaining and price-cost margins of firms+Abraham, Filip; Konings, Jozef; Vanormelingen, Stijn+REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS+APR 2009::Structural Identification of Production Functions+Ackerberg, D.

The Low-Pay No-Pay Cycle: Are There Systematic Differences across Demographic Groups?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12084,DEC 2015,22,3,"We investigate transitions between unemployment, low-paid employment and higher-paid employment using dynamic panel data methods applied to household panel data. We find state dependence in both unemployment and low-paid employment and evidence of a low-pay no-pay cycle. However, we also find significant differences in effects across population subgroups. Typically, the young and better-educated face lower penalties from unemployment and low-paid employment. Further, low-paid employment is preferable to unemployment for women regardless of their demographic characteristics, but for men who have only completed secondary schooling, low-paid employment actually decreases the chances of entering higher-paid employment by more than does unemployment.",,"TRANSITION-PROBABILITIES,UNEMPLOYMENT DYNAMICS,LABOR-MARKET,EMPLOYMENT,HETEROGENEITY,DEPENDENCE,MOBILITY,MODELS","Fok, Yin King@Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia::Scutella, Rosanna@Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia::Wilkins, Roger@Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Fok, Yin King@University of Melbourne::Scutella, Rosanna@University of Melbourne::Wilkins, Roger@University of Melbourne",not exist,"Interaction terms in logit and probit models+Ai, CR; Norton, EC+ECONOMICS LETTERS+JUL 2003::The Wooldridge Method for the Initial Values Problem is Simple: What About Performance?+Akay, A.+IZA Discussion Paper No. 3943+2009::Unemployment persistence+Arulampalam, W; Booth, AL; Taylor, MP+OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES+JAN 2000::Low-Paid Employment and Unemployment Dynamics in Australia+Buddelmeyer, Hielke; Lee, Wang-Sheng; Wooden, Mark+ECONOMIC RECORD+MAR 2010::Estimating low pay transition probabilities accounting for endogenous selection mechanisms+Cappellari, Lorenzo; Jenkins, Stephen P.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2008::TRANSITIONS BETWEEN UNEMPLOYMENT AND LOW PAY+Cappellari, Lorenzo; Jenkins, Stephen P.+WORK, EARNINGS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATION+2008::Teenage unemployment: permanent scars or temporary blemishes+Ellwood, D.+The youth labor market problem: its nature causes and consequences+1982::Mobility in the urban labor market: A panel data analysis for Mexico+Gong, XD; Van Soest, A; Villagomez, E+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+OCT 2004::The Incidental Parameters Problem and the Problem of Initial Conditions in Estimating aDiscrete Time-Discrete Data Stochastic Process+HECKMAN, J.+Structural Analysis of Discrete Data With Econometric Applications+1981::Dynamic relationships in the Australian labour market heterogeneity and state dependence+Knights, S; Harris, MN; Loundes, J+ECONOMIC RECORD+SEP 2002::A THEORY OF SIGNALING DURING JOB SEARCH, EMPLOYMENT EFFICIENCY, AND STIGMATISED JOBS+MCCORMICK, B+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1990::Low-Wage Jobs-Stepping Stones or Just Bad Signals?+Mosthaf, A.+Discussion Paper No. 11/2011+2011::Low-wage Employment versus Unemployment: Which One Provides Better Prospects for Women?+Mosthaf, A.; Schank, T.; Schnabel, C.+IZA Discussion Paper No. 4611+2009::POOLING OF TIME-SERIES AND CROSS-SECTION DATA+MUNDLAK, Y+ECONOMETRICA+1978::no title+no author+OECD Economic Surveys: Australia 2010+2010::THE WAGE MOBILITY OF MINIMUM-WAGE WORKERS+SMITH, RE; VAVRICHEK, B+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+OCT 1992::The interrelated dynamics of unemployment and low-wage employment+Stewart, Mark B.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+APR-MAY 2007::Low pay dynamics and transition probabilities+Stewart, MB; Swaffield, JK+ECONOMICA+FEB 1999::From No Pay to Low Pay and Back Again?

On the Practice of Lagging Variables to Avoid Simultaneity,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12088,DEC 2015,15,28,"A common practice in applied economics research consists of replacing a suspected simultaneously determined explanatory variable with its lagged value. This note demonstrates that this practice does not enable one to avoid simultaneity bias. The associated estimates are still inconsistent, and hypothesis testing is invalid. An alternative is to use lagged values of the endogenous variable in instrumental variable estimation. However, this is only an effective estimation strategy if the lagged values do not themselves belong in the respective estimating equation, and if they are sufficiently correlated with the simultaneously determined explanatory variable.","Simultaneity,Reverse causality,Lagged variables","PERFORMANCE,GROWTH","Reed, William Robert@Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand","Reed, William Robert@University of Canterbury","Reed, W.

Inflation perceptions and expectations in Sweden - Are media reports the missing link?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12078,OCT 2015,27,7,"We analyze the interrelation between consumers' quantitative inflation perceptions and expectations as well as actual inflation rates in Sweden. The role of media reports about inflation is emphasized. Structural vector error correction models show stable cointegration between actual, perceived and expected inflation. Impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions suggest strong interaction between perceived and expected inflation, with a lesser role for actual inflation. Media effects are generally small, but imply an asymmetric reaction of inflation expectations and perceptions to news on increasing vs. decreasing inflation. Thus, to anchor inflation expectations, central banks should explore better communication channels to inform consumers about actual inflation.",,INFORMATION,"Draeger, Lena@Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Draeger, Lena@University of Hamburg",not exist,"Public attitudes to inflation and interest rates+Benford, J.; Driver, R.+Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin+2008::The epidemiology of macroeconomic expectations+Carroll, C.+NBER Working Paper 8695+2001::Rational Inattention, Inflation Developments and Perceptions after the Euro Cash Changeover+EHRMANN, M.+ECB Working Paper, No. 588+2006::no title+FORSELLS M+163 ECB+2002::INVESTIGATING CAUSAL RELATIONS BY ECONOMETRIC MODELS AND CROSS-SPECTRAL METHODS+GRANGER, CWJ+ECONOMETRICA+1969::Consumer adaptation strategies: from Austrian shilling to the Euro+Hofmann, E.; Kirchler, E.; Kamleitner, B.+Journal of Consumer Policy+2007::ARE PERCEPTIONS OF INFLATION RATIONAL - SOME EVIDENCE FOR SWEDEN+JONUNG, L; LAIDLER, D+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1988::PERCEIVED AND EXPECTED RATES OF INFLATION IN SWEDEN+JONUNG, L+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1981::Macroeconomic Literacy, Numeracy and the Implications for Monetary Policy+Kelly, Roger; Blanchflower, David G.+Bank of England working paper+April  2008::no title+Kirchgassner, G; Wolters, J.+INTRO MODERN TIME SE+2008::The Euro Cash Changeover, Inflation Perceptions and the Media+Lamla, M.

Understanding Price Stickiness: Firm-level Evidence on Price Adjustment Lags and Their Asymmetries,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12083,OCT 2015,62,0,"We study the speed of price reactions to positive and negative demand and cost shocks. Our findings suggest that price adjustment lags vary in line with the predictions of optimal price setting models. Moreover, we find that the firms' reactions are asymmetric, and that these asymmetries cannot be fully explained by any single theoretical model of asymmetric price adjustment. Overall, these results suggest that the reaction to monetary policy shocks may depend on which firms or sectors are particularly affected by them and, therefore, that richer models are needed to fully understand the effects of monetary policy.",,"MONETARY-POLICY,STICKY PRICES,CONSUMER SEARCH,PHILLIPS-CURVE,MENU COSTS,EURO AREA,US,INFLATION,FACTS,FREQUENCY","Dias, Daniel A.@Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@CEMAPRE, Urbana, IL 61801 USA::Marques, Carlos Robalo@Banco Portugal, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal::Martins, Fernando@Univ Lisbon, ISEG, Banco Portugal, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lusiada Lisboa, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal::Silva, J.

The Route to Take-up: Evidence from the UK Pension Credit Reform,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12080,OCT 2015,55,0,"Viable routes to increase the take-up of cash transfer programs include raising the financial incentive to claim and reducing claiming barriers. Older people's response to both is evaluated exploiting the introduction of Pension Credit in the UK. The reform involved improved application assistance, simplified claiming procedure, extended recertification interval, less intrusive reporting requirements and outreach campaigning; also, the cash entitlement was increased for a subgroup of pensioners. The behavioral response is identified using Family Resources Survey data. Results support the effectiveness of financial incentives, while no effect is found in the case of reducing barriers policies when unaccompanied by financial incentives.",,"MEANS-TESTED BENEFITS,FOOD STAMP PROGRAM,DETERMINING PARTICIPATION,WELFARE-REFORM,INCOME SUPPORT,ELIGIBILITY,ECONOMY,MODEL,BIAS,SSI","Zantomio, Francesca@Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy","Zantomio, Francesca@Universita Ca Foscari Venezia",not exist,"no title+no author+The impact of Pension Credit on those receiving it+2004::Unemployment insurance takeup rates and the after-tax value of benefits+Anderson, PM; Meyer, BD+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1997::The economics of welfare participation and welfare stigma: A review+Andrade, Carlos.+Public Finance and Management+2002::DETERMINING PARTICIPATION IN INCOME-TESTED SOCIAL PROGRAMS+ASHENFELTER, O+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::Why are welfare caseloads falling?

Bootstrap Co-integration Rank Testing: The Effect of Bias-Correcting Parameter Estimates,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12090,OCT 2015,21,2,Bootstrap-based methods for bias-correcting the first-stage parameter estimates used in some recently developed bootstrap implementations of co-integration rank tests are investigated. The procedure constructs estimates of the bias in the original parameter estimates by using the average bias in the corresponding parameter estimates taken across a large number of auxiliary bootstrap replications. A number of possible implementations of this procedure are discussed and concrete recommendations made on the basis of finite sample performance evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation methods. The results show that bootstrap-based bias-correction methods can significantly improve the small sample performance of the bootstrap co-integration rank tests.,,"VAR MODELS,INFERENCE","Cavaliere, Giuseppe@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy::Taylor, A.

As is well known, in such case the OLS estimator is T-consistent, whereas it is root NT-consistent when there is no endogeneity. Other estimators can be employed, such as the FM-OLS, that are root NT-consistent irrespective of whether exogeneity is present or not. Using the difference between the former and the latter estimator, we construct a test statistic which diverges at a rate root NT under the null of endogeneity, whilst it is bounded under the alternative of exogeneity, and employ a randomization approach to carry out the test. Monte Carlo evidence shows that the test has the correct size and good power.",,"UNIT-ROOT TESTS,REGRESSION,POWER","Trapani, Lorenzo@City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England","Trapani, Lorenzo@Unknow","Trapani, Lorenzo@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3425-2786","Panel cointegration with global stochastic trends+Bai, Jushan; Kao, Chihwa; Ng, Serena+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 2009::NONPARAMETRIC NONSTATIONARITY TESTS+Bandi, Federico M.; Corradi, Valentina+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+FEB 2014::A parametric approach to the estimation of cointegration vectors in panel data+Breitung, J+ECONOMETRIC REVIEWS+2005::no title+Caporale, G.

It is shown, both analytically and through Monte Carlo simulations, that the presence of complex (near) unit roots can severely bias the size properties of these tests. Given the popularity of these tests with applied researchers and their routine presence in most econometric software packages, the results presented in this paper suggest that practitioners should treat the outcomes of these tests with some caution when applied to data which display a strong cyclical component.",,"COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION,TIME-SERIES REGRESSION,UNIT-ROOT TESTS,MODELS,REAL","Del Barrio Castro, Tomas@Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma De Mallorca, Spain::Rodrigues, Paulo M.

We find a large negative wage effect of working part-time (PT), which differs by motherhood status and contract type. We also find that working PT involves lower returns to experience than standard full-time employment and thus a substantial negative wage effect accumulates over time for those employed PT. Finally, our simulations reveal that working PT also raises the probability of working under a fixed-term contract.",,"WAGE DIFFERENTIALS,LABOR-MARKET,EMPLOYMENT,TEMPORARY,SENIORITY,MOBILITY,WOMEN","Fernandez-Kranz, Daniel@IE Business Sch, D-47057 Duisburg, Nrw, Germany::Paul, Marie@Univ Duisburg Essen, Ruhr Grad Sch Econ, D-45128 Essen, Nrw, Germany::Rodriguez-Planas, Nuria@CUNY Queens Coll, Queens, NY 11367 USA@IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany","Fernandez-Kranz, Daniel@Unknow::Paul, Marie@University of Duisburg Essen::Rodriguez-Planas, Nuria@City University of New York (CUNY) System@IZA Institute Labor Economics",not exist,"The effect of part-time work on wages: Evidence from the social security rules+Aaronson, D; French, E+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+APR 2004::Wage growth implications of fixed-term employment: An analysis by contract duration and job mobility+Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina; Serrano-Padial, Ricardo+LABOUR ECONOMICS+OCT 2007::Simplified Implementation of the Heckman Estimator of the Dynamic Probit Model and a Comparison with Alternative Estimators*+Arulampalam, Wiji; Stewart, Mark B.+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+OCT 2009::MEASURING STATE DEPENDENCE IN INDIVIDUAL POVERTY HISTORIES WHEN THERE IS FEEDBACK TO EMPLOYMENT STATUS AND HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION+Biewen, Martin+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+NOV-DEC 2009::The perverse effects of partial labour market reform: Fixed-term contracts in France+Blanchard, O; Landier, A+ECONOMIC JOURNAL+JUN 2002::Labour market dynamics and part-time work+Blank, R.+Research in Labour Economics+1998::TEMPORARY CONTRACTS AND WORK-FAMILY BALANCE IN A DUAL LABOR MARKET+Bonet, Rocio; Cruz, Cristina; Fernandez Kranz, Daniel; et al.+ILR REVIEW+JAN 2013::Temporary Jobs : Stepping Stones or Dead Ends?+BOOTH, A.; FRANCESCONI, M.; FRANK, J.+Economic Journal Features, Symposium on Temporary Work+2002::Back-to-front down under?

Returns to Skills and the Distribution of Wages: Spain 1995-2010,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12077,AUG 2015,31,5,"In contrast to the pattern observed in other developed countries, the Spanish wage distribution compressed between 1995 and 2006 and became more disperse afterwards, so that in 2010 wage inequality was roughly similar to 1995. In this paper, we analyze the role of supply and demand factors when accounting for these facts. We start by decomposing observed wage changes into changes in the composition of the labour force and changes in the returns of workers' and jobs' characteristics. The results indicate that the compression of the wage distribution between 1995 and 2006 is largely explained by changes in returns, and particularly, by a decrease in the returns to education. We show that both the increase in the supply of high-skilled workers and the increasing weight of low-skilled occupations are related to the decreasing trend in the skill premium over this period. In contrast, the widening of the wage distribution after 2006 is largely explained by an increase in the relative demand for high-skilled workers generating an increase in the school premium.",,"QUANTILE REGRESSION,LABOR-MARKET,DECOMPOSITION,POLARIZATION,IMMIGRATION,INEQUALITY,SWEDEN","Carrasco, Raquel@Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid 28903, Spain::Jimeno, Juan F.@Banco Espana, Madrid 28014, Spain::Carolina Ortega, A.@Univ Nacl Tucuman, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina","Carrasco, Raquel@Universidad Carlos III de Madrid::Jimeno, Juan F.@Unknow::Carolina Ortega, A.@Universidad Nacional de Tucuman","Carrasco, Raquel@H-5596-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2550-6350","Is there a glass ceiling in Sweden?+Albrecht, J; Bjorklund, A; Vroman, S+JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS+JAN 2003::UNIONIZATION AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE WAGE DISTRIBUTION IN SWEDEN: 1968 TO 2000+Albrecht, James; Bjorklund, Anders; Woman, Susan+INDUSTRIAL &amp; LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW+OCT 2011::Macroeconomic adjustment under loose financing conditions in the construction sector'+Arce, O.; Campa, J.

Using Compulsory Mobility to Identify School Quality and Peer Effects,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12076,AUG 2015,25,2,"Education production functions that feature school and student fixed effects are identified using students' school mobility. However, student mobility is driven by factors like parents' labour market shocks and divorce. Movers experience large achievement drops, are more often minority and free meal students, and sort endogenously into peer groups and school types.

It uses a benchmark dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model enriched with labour market frictions and investment-specific technological progress that enables a novel identification scheme based on sign restrictions on a SVAR with time-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility. Key findings are: (i) the volatility in job finding and separation rates has declined over time, while their correlation varies across time; (ii) the job finding rate plays an important role for unemployment, and the two series are strongly negatively correlated over the sample period; (iii) the magnitude of the response of labour market variables to technology shocks varies across the sample period.",,"STRUCTURAL VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIONS,STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY MODELS,LONG-RUN RESTRICTIONS,TECHNOLOGY SHOCKS,MONETARY-POLICY,EMPLOYMENT,FRICTIONS,US","Mumtaz, Haroon@Queen Mary Univ, London E1 4NS, England::Zanetti, Francesco@Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England","Mumtaz, Haroon@Queen Mary University London@University of London::Zanetti, Francesco@University of Oxford",not exist,"Evolving US monetary policy and the decline of inflation predictability+Benati, Luca; Surico, Paolo+JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION+APR-MAY 2008::Deviance information criterion for comparing stochastic volatility models+Berg, A; Meyer, R; Yu, J+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2004::Business cycle measurement with some theory+Canova, Fabio; Paustian, Matthias+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+MAY 2011::ON GIBBS SAMPLING FOR STATE-SPACE MODELS+CARTER, CK; KOHN, R+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1994::Are structural VARs with long-run restrictions useful in developing business cycle theory?+Chari, V.

Why Do African Banks Lend So Little?,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12067,JUN 2015,28,7,"We put forward a plausible explanation of African banking sector under-development in the form of a bad credit market equilibrium. Using an appropriately modified Industrial Organization model of banking, we show that the root of the problem could be unchecked moral hazard (strategic loan defaults) or adverse selection (a lack of good projects). Applying a dynamic panel estimator to a large sample of African banks, we show that loan defaults are a major factor inhibiting bank lending when institutional quality is low. We also find that once a threshold level of institutional quality has been reached, improvements in the default rate or institutional quality do not matter.

Forecasting GDP over the Business Cycle in a Multi-Frequency and Data-Rich Environment,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12069,JUN 2015,36,0,"This paper merges two specifications recently developed in the forecasting literature: the MS-MIDAS model (Guerin and Marcellino, 2013) and the factor-MIDAS model (Marcellino and Schumacher, 2010). The MS-factor MIDAS model that we introduce incorporates the information provided by a large data set consisting of mixed frequency variables and captures regime-switching behaviours.

Assuming that intellectual collaboration is exogenously determined, prior studies found a negative relationship between co-authorship and productivity. I examine a panel data on economists publishing from 1970 to 2011 to test the causal effect of intellectual collaboration on intellectual output. As characteristics of the individual and her opportunity set are endogenously related to both collaboration and productivity, I instrument the amount of co-authorship by the common research interest between an author and her potential co-authors. After controlling for endogenous co-authorship formation, unobservable heterogeneity and time varying factors, the effect of intellectual collaboration on individual performance becomes positive.",,"RESEARCH COLLABORATION,SOCIAL NETWORKS,ECONOMICS,IMPACT,QUALITY,OUTPUT,SPECIFICATION,SCIENTISTS,MODELS","Ductor, Lorenzo@Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Auckland, New Zealand","Ductor, Lorenzo@Massey University",not exist,"Co-authorship in management and organizational studies: An empirical and network analysis+Acedo, FJ; Barroso, C; Casanueva, C; et al.+JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES+JUL 2006::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::SUPERSTAR EXTINCTION+Azoulay, Pierre; Zivin, Joshua S.

By exploring microdata for Spain, including data on innovation and trade, we find a robust relationship between imports, exports and innovation. The results suggest that firms learn primarily from import links, which enable them to innovate and to dress up' for starting to export.

Equilibrium Unemployment Dynamics in a Panel of OECD Countries,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12061,APR 2015,32,3,"We focus on the equilibrium unemployment rate as a parameter implied by a dynamic aggregate model of wage and price setting. The equilibrium unemployment rate depends on institutional labour market institutions through mark-up coefficients. Compared with existing studies, the resulting final equation for unemployment has a richer dynamic structure. The empirical investigation is conducted in a panel data framework and uses OECD data up to 2012. We propose to extend the standard estimation method with time dummies to control and capture the effects of common and national shocks by using impulse indicator saturation (WG-IIS), which has not been previously used on panel data. WG-IIS robustifies the estimators of the regression coefficients in the dynamic model, and it affects the estimated equilibrium unemployment rates. We find that wage co-ordination stands out as the most important institutional variable in our data set, but there is also evidence pointing to the tax wedge and the degree of compensation in the unemployment insurance system as drivers of equilibrium unemployment.",,"MODEL SELECTION,INSTITUTIONS,INFLATION","Nymoen, Ragnar@Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0316 Oslo, Norway::Sparrman, Victoria@Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway","Nymoen, Ragnar@University of Oslo::Sparrman, Victoria@Statistics Norway",not exist,"no title+Arellano, M.+Panel Data Econometrics+2003::no title+Baltagi, B.+Econometric analysis of panel data+2008::Testing steady-state implications for the NAIRU+Bardsen, G; Nymoen, R+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 2003::Natural Rate Dynamics Reconsidered+Bardsen, G.; Nymoen, R.

We address endogenous selection into education, cohort effects and endogenous selection into work. Using the September 2007 South African Labour Force Survey, the upper bound estimates are considerably lower than existing parametric point estimates of the return to education. As a lesson, policy makers should focus less on increasing the amount of education obtained by Africans and Coloureds, but rather on measures that can grow the return to existing levels of education.",,"MONOTONE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES,ECONOMETRIC-MODELS,INFERENCE,RETURNS,UNEMPLOYMENT,PARAMETERS,EMPLOYMENT,BOOTSTRAP,WAGES,SET","Mariotti, Martine@Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia::Meinecke, Juergen@Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Mariotti, Martine@Australian National University::Meinecke, Juergen@Australian National University",not exist,"Causes and consequences of schooling outcomes in South Africa: Evidence from survey data+Anderson, KG; Case, A; Lam, D+SOCIAL DYNAMICS-A JOURNAL OF THE CENTRE FOR AFRICAN STUDIES UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN+SUM 2001::Inconsistency of the bootstrap when a parameter is on the boundary of the parameter space+Andrews, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2000::Why has unemployment risen in the New South Africa?+Banerjee, Abhijit; Galiani, Sebastian; Levinsohn, Jim; et al.+ECONOMICS OF TRANSITION+2008::Changes in the distribution of male and female wages accounting for employment composition using bounds+Blundell, Richard; Gosling, Amanda; Ichimura, Hidehiko; et al.+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2007::Bootstrap Inference in Partially Identified Models Defined by Moment Inequalities: Coverage of the Identified Set+Bugni, Federico A.+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2010::Estimating the return to schooling: Progress on some persistent econometric problems+Card, D+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2001::no title+GOLDBERGER AS+TOPICS REGRESSION AN+1968::ECONOMETRIC EVALUATION OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS, PART I: CAUSAL MODELS, STRUCTURAL MODELS AND ECONOMETRIC POLICY EVALUATION+Heckman, James J.; Vytlacil, Edward J.+HANDBOOK OF ECONOMETRICS, VOL 6B+2007::Structural equations, treatment effects, and econometric policy evaluation+Heckman, JJ; Vytlacil, E+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 2005::Upward bias in the estimated returns to education: Evidence from South Africa+Hertz, T+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 2003::SHEEPSKIN EFFECTS IN THE RETURNS TO EDUCATION+HUNGERFORD, T; SOLON, G+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1987::Confidence intervals for partially identified parameters+Imbens, GW; Manski, CF+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 2004::Race and the incidence of unemployment in South Africa+Kingdon, G.

Equity-Efficiency Optimizing Resource Allocation: The Role of Time Preferences in a Repeated Irrigation Game,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12058,APR 2015,31,2,"We study repeated water allocation decisions among small scale irrigation users in Tanzania. In a treatment replicating water scarcity conditions, convexities in production make that substantial efficiency gains can be obtained by deviating from equal sharing, leading to an equity-efficiency trade-off. In a repeated game setting, it becomes possible to reconcile efficiency with equity by rotating the person who receives the largest share, but such a strategy requires a longer run perspective. Correlating experimental data from an irrigation game with individual time preference data, we find that less patient irrigators are less likely to use a rotation strategy.",,"CREDIT ASSOCIATIONS,ROTATING SAVINGS,FIELD,COOPERATION,TANZANIA,INSTITUTIONS,COMPETITION,MANAGEMENT,ECONOMICS,COMMONS","Van Campenhout, Bjorn@Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI Kampala, Kampala, Uganda::D'Exelle, Ben@Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England::Lecoutere, Els@Univ Ghent, Conflict Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Van Campenhout, Bjorn@Unknow::D'Exelle, Ben@University of East Anglia::Lecoutere, Els@Ghent University",not exist,"Water use of oilseed crops+Aiken, R.; Lamm, F.; Aboukheira, A.A.+P 23 ANN CENTR PLAIN+2011::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::The Impact of Education on Subjective Discount Rate in Ugandan Villages+Bauer, Michal; Chytilova, Julie+ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE+JUL 2010::The endogenous determination of time preference+Becker, GS; Mulligan, CB+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 1997::THE ECONOMICS OF ROTATING SAVINGS AND CREDIT ASSOCIATIONS+BESLEY, T; COATE, S; LOURY, G+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1993::TESTING NONCOOPERATIVE BARGAINING THEORY - A PRELIMINARY-STUDY+BINMORE, K; SHAKED, A; SUTTON, J+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+1985::no title+Binmore, K.; Swierzbinski, J.; Tomlinson, C.+An Experimental Test of Rubinstein's Bargaining Model+2007::ATTITUDES TOWARD RISK - EXPERIMENTAL-MEASUREMENT IN RURAL INDIA+BINSWANGER, HP+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+1980::ERC: A theory of equity, reciprocity, and competition+Bolton, GE; Ockenfels, A+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+MAR 2000::no title+BRUNS B+WATER RIGHTS REFORM+2005::ULTIMATUMS, DICTATORS AND MANNERS+CAMERER, C; THALER, RH+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+SPR 1995::no title+Camerer, C.

A Partially Heterogeneous Framework for Analyzing Panel Data,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12062,APR 2015,23,5,"This article proposes a partially heterogeneous framework for the analysis of panel data with fixed T. In particular, the population of cross-sectional units is grouped into clusters, such that slope parameter homogeneity is maintained only within clusters. Our method assumes no a priori information about the number of clusters and cluster membership and relies on the data instead. The unknown number of clusters and the corresponding partition are determined based on the concept of partitional clustering', using an information-based criterion. It is shown that this is strongly consistent, that is, it selects the true number of clusters with probability one as N. Simulation experiments show that the proposed criterion performs well even with moderate N and the resulting parameter estimates are close to the true values. We apply the method in a panel data set of commercial banks in the US and we find five clusters, with significant differences in the slope parameters across clusters.",,"CLUSTER-ANALYSIS,SET,REGRESSIONS,ALGORITHM,NUMBER","Sarafidis, Vasilis@Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia::Weber, Neville@Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Sarafidis, Vasilis@Unknow::Weber, Neville@University of Sydney",not exist,"Model selection with data-oriented penalty+Bai, ZD; Rao, CR; Wu, Y+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 15 1999::Pooled estimators vs their heterogeneous counterparts in the context of dynamic demand for gasoline+Baltagi, BH; Griffin, JM+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1997::A genetic algorithm for the set covering problem+Beasley, JE; Chu, PC+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+OCT 25 1996::Heterogeneity and microeconometric modelling+Browning, M.; Carro, J.+ADV EC ECONOMETRICS+2007::Production function regressions, returns to scale, and externalities+Burnside, C+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+APR 1996::MULTIPLE REGIMES AND CROSS-COUNTRY GROWTH-BEHAVIOR+DURLAUF, SN; JOHNSON, PA+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+OCT-DEC 1995::no title+Everitt, B.

Asymmetric Quantile Persistence and Predictability: the Case of US Inflation,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12065,APR 2015,22,8,"This article investigates the evidence of time-variation and asymmetry in the persistence of US inflation. We compare the out-of-sample performance of different forecasting models and find that quantile forecasts from an Auto-Regressive (AR) model with level-dependent volatility are at least as accurate as the forecasts of the Quantile Auto-Regressive model, in particular for the core inflation measures. Our results indicate that the persistence of core inflation has been relatively constant and high, but it declined for the headline inflation measures. We also find that the asymmetric persistence of inflation shocks can be mostly attributed to the positive relation between inflation level and its volatility.",,"AUTOREGRESSION,UNCERTAINTY,REGIMES,TESTS","Manzan, Sebastiano@CUNY, Baruch Coll, Bert Wasserman Dept Econ & Finance, New York, NY 10010 USA::Zerom, Dawit@Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA","Manzan, Sebastiano@Baruch College (CUNY)@City University of New York (CUNY) System::Zerom, Dawit@California State University System@California State University Fullerton","Manzan, Sebastiano@C-4150-2014","Comparing density forecasts via weighted likelihood ratio tests+Amisano, Gianni; Giacomini, Raffaella+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 2007::DO RECESSIONS PERMANENTLY CHANGE OUTPUT+BEAUDRY, P; KOOP, G+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+APR 1993::Investigating inflation persistence across monetary regimes+Benati, Luca+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 2008::Are higher levels of inflation less predictable?

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, most developing countries also hold elections, but these are often marred by illicit tactics. Using a new global data set, this article investigates whether these illicit tactics are merely blemishes or substantially undermine the economic efficacy of elections. We show that illicit tactics are widespread, and that they reduce the incentive for governments to deliver good economic performance.

The article investigates for a number of Euro-area variables whether forecasts based on the factor-backdated data are more precise than those obtained with standard area-wide data. A recursive pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting experiment using quarterly data is conducted.

Production Technology Estimates and Balanced Growth,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12049,FEB 2015,30,10,"Capital-labour substitution and total factor productivity (TFP) estimates are essential features of many economic models. Such models typically embody a balanced growth path. This often leads researchers to estimate models imposing stringent prior choices on technical change. We demonstrate that estimation of the substitution elasticity and TFP growth can be substantially biased if technical progress is thereby mis-specified. We obtain analytical and simulation results in the context of a model consistent with balanced and near-balanced growth (i.e. departures from balanced growth but broadly stable factor shares). Given this evidence, a constant elasticity of substitution production function system is then estimated for the US economy. Results show that the estimated substitution elasticity tends to be significantly lower using a factor-augmenting specification (well below one). We are also able to reject conventional neutrality forms in favour of general factor augmentation with a non-negligible capital-augmenting component. Our work thus provides insights into production and supply-side estimation in balanced-growth frameworks.",,"TECHNICAL CHANGE,SUBSTITUTION,ELASTICITY,US","Leon-Ledesma, Miguel A.@Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England::McAdam, Peter@European Cent Bank, Res Dept, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany@Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England::Willman, Alpo@Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England@European Cent Bank, Res Dept, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany","Leon-Ledesma, Miguel A.@University of Kent::McAdam, Peter@European Central Bank@University of Surrey::Willman, Alpo@University of Kent@European Central Bank",not exist,"Equilibrium bias of technology+Acemoglu, D.+Econometrica+2007::no title+Acemoglu, D.+Introduction to Modern Economic Growth+2009::Is the U.S. Aggregate Production Function Cobb-Douglas?

The model is then empirically implemented through a two-stage estimation procedure. We argue that this estimation procedure is only valid under the strong distributional assumptions maintained in the article. Statistical tests using the HMR sample, however, clearly reject such assumptions. Moreover, we perform numerical experiments which show that the HMR two-stage estimator is very sensitive to departures from the assumption of homoskedasticity.

A Comparison of Sequential and Information-based Methods for Determining the Co-integration Rank in Heteroskedastic VAR Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12051,FEB 2015,27,4,"In this article, we investigate the behaviour of a number of methods for estimating the co-integration rank in VAR systems characterized by heteroskedastic innovation processes. In particular, we compare the efficacy of the most widely used information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) , with the commonly used sequential approach of Johansen [Likelihood-based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models (1996)] based around the use of either asymptotic or wild bootstrap-based likelihood ratio type tests. Complementing recent work done for the latter in Cavaliere, Rahbek and Taylor [Econometric Reviews (2014) forthcoming], we establish the asymptotic properties of the procedures based on information criteria in the presence of heteroskedasticity (conditional or unconditional) of a quite general and unknown form. The relative finite-sample properties of the different methods are investigated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study. For the simulation DGPs considered in the analysis, we find that the BIC-based procedure and the bootstrap sequential test procedure deliver the best overall performance in terms of their frequency of selecting the correct co-integration rank across different values of the co-integration rank, sample size, stationary dynamics and models of heteroskedasticity. Of these, the wild bootstrap procedure is perhaps the more reliable overall as it avoids a significant tendency seen in the BIC-based method to over-estimate the co-integration rank in relatively small sample sizes.",,"CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY,BOOTSTRAP DETERMINATION,SELECTION,CRITERION,FORM","Cavaliere, Giuseppe@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, I-40124 Bologna, Italy::De Angelis, Luca@Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, I-40124 Bologna, Italy::Rahbek, Anders@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark::Taylor, A.

Sharp Bounds on Causal Effects under Sample Selection,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12056,FEB 2015,48,2,"In many empirical problems, the evaluation of treatment effects is complicated by sample selection so that the outcome is only observed for a non-random subpopulation. In the absence of instruments and/or tight parametric assumptions, treatment effects are not point identified, but can be bounded under mild restrictions. Previous work on partial identification has primarily focused on the always observed' (irrespective of the treatment). This article complements those studies by considering further populations, namely the compliers' (observed only if treated) and the observed population. We derive sharp bounds under various assumptions and provide an empirical application to a school voucher experiment.",,"PARTIALLY IDENTIFIED PARAMETERS,JOB-TRAINING PROGRAMS,PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION,NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION,RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTS,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,MISSING DATA,MODELS,INFERENCE,WAGES","Huber, Martin@Univ St Gallen, Dept Econ, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland::Mellace, Giovanni@Univ St Gallen, Dept Econ, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland","Huber, Martin@University of St Gallen::Mellace, Giovanni@University of St Gallen","Mellace, Giovanni@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1784-6654","Long-term educational consequences of secondary school vouchers: Evidence from administrative records in Colombia+Angrist, J; Bettinger, E; Kremer, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2006::Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::Bounds on Quantile Treatment Effects of Job Corps on Participants' Wages+Blanco, G.; Flores, C.

On the Importance of the First Observation in GLS Detrending in Unit Root Testing,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12050,FEB 2015,15,0,"First-differencing is generally taken to imply the loss of one observation, the first, or at least that the effect of ignoring this observation is asymptotically negligible. However, this is not always true, as in the case of generalized least squares (GLS) detrending. In order to illustrate this, the current article considers as an example the use of GLS detrended data when testing for a unit root. The results show that the treatment of the first observation is absolutely crucial for test performance, and that ignorance causes test break-down.",,"PANEL-DATA,INITIAL CONDITION,POWER","Westerlund, Joakim@Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Financial Econometr Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia","Westerlund, Joakim@Deakin University",not exist,"A panic attack on unit roots and cointegration+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2004::PANEL UNIT ROOT TESTS WITH CROSS-SECTION DEPENDENCE: A FURTHER INVESTIGATION+Bai, Jushan; Ng, Serena+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 2010::no title+BREITUNG J+ECONOMETRICS PANEL D+2008::Series-specific unit root tests with panel data+Breuer, JB; McNown, R; Wallace, M+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+DEC 2002::Unit root tests for panel data+Choi, I+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE+APR 2001::Efficient tests for an autoregressive unit root+Elliott, G; Rothenberg, TJ; Stock, JH+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1996::Testing for unit roots with stationary covariates+Elliott, G; Jansson, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 2003::UNIT ROOT TESTING IN PRACTICE: DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTY OVER THE TREND AND INITIAL CONDITION+Harvey, David I.; Leybourne, Stephen J.; Taylor, A.

Constructing Multi-Country Rational Expectations Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12046,DEC 2014,28,7,"This article considers some of the technical issues involved in using the global vector autoregression (GVAR) approach to construct a multi-country rational expectations (RE) model and illustrates them with a new Keynesian model for 33 countries estimated with quarterly data over the period 1980-2011. The issues considered are: the measurement of steady states; the determination of exchange rates and the specification of the short-run country-specific models; the identification and estimation of the model subject to the theoretical constraints required for a determinate rational expectations solution; the solution of a large RE model; the structure and estimation of the covariance matrix and the simulation of shocks. The model used as an illustration shows that global demand and supply shocks are the most important drivers of output, inflation and interest rates in the long run. By contrast, monetary or exchange rate shocks have only a short-run impact in the evolution of the world economy. The article also shows the importance of international connections, directly as well as indirectly through spillover effects. Overall, ignoring global inter-connections as country-specific models do, could give rise to misleading conclusions.",,"TRANSITORY COMPONENTS,COVARIANCE,PERSPECTIVE,PERMANENT","Dees, Stephane@European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany::Pesaran, M.

Variable Selection in Cross-Section Regressions: Comparisons and Extensions,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12048,DEC 2014,59,3,"Cross-section regressions often examine many candidate regressors. We use multiple testing procedures (MTPs) controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) - the expected ratio of false to all rejections - so as not to erroneously select variables because many tests were performed, yielding a simple model selection procedure. Simulations comparing the MTPs with other common model selection criteria demonstrate that, for conventional tuning parameters of the selection procedures, only MTPs consistently control the FDR, but have slightly lower power. In an empirical application to growth, MTPs and PcGets/Autometrics identify similar growth determinants, which differ somewhat from those obtained by Bayesian Model Averaging.",,"FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,COUNTRY GROWTH REGRESSIONS,GENERALIZED ERROR RATES,MODEL SELECTION,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,ADAPTIVE LASSO,DETERMINANTS,BOOTSTRAP,EMPIRICS,PRIORS","Deckers, Thomas@Univ Bonn, Bonn Grad Sch Econ BGSE, Bonn, Germany::Hanck, Christoph@Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany","Deckers, Thomas@University of Bonn::Hanck, Christoph@University of Duisburg Essen",not exist,"Adapting to unknown sparsity by controlling the false discovery rate+Abramovich, Felix; Benjamini, Yoav; Donoho, David L.; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2006::Model selection via genetic algorithms illustrated with cross-country growth data+Acosta-Gonzalez, Eduardo; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Fernando+EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS+2007::no title+Barro, R.

This gives rise to two levels of uncertainty: concepts (level 1) and measurements within each concept (level 2). In this paper we propose a hierarchical weighted least squares (HWALS) method to address these uncertainties. We examine the effects of different growth determinants taking explicit account of the measurement problem in the growth regressions. We find that estimates produced by HWALS provide intuitive and robust explanations.

We propose a discrete-time multi-spell duration model that not only corrects for unobserved heterogeneity, but also addresses the endogeneity due to dynamic selection associated with household's livelihood strategies. The household choosing farming or out-migration as a main livelihood strategy was more likely to escape from persistent poverty than those taking local non-agricultural employment.

Break Date Estimation for Models with Deterministic Structural Change,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12037,OCT 2014,17,3,"In this article, we consider estimating the timing of a break in level and/or trend when the order of integration and autocorrelation properties of the data are unknown. For stationary innovations, break point estimation is commonly performed by minimizing the sum of squared residuals across all candidate break points, using a regression of the levels of the series on the assumed deterministic components. For unit root processes, the obvious modification is to use a first differenced version of the regression, while a further alternative in a stationary autoregressive setting is to consider a GLS-type quasi-differenced regression. Given uncertainty over which of these approaches to adopt in practice, we develop a hybrid break fraction estimator that selects from the levels-based estimator, the first-difference-based estimator, and a range of quasi-difference-based estimators, according to which achieves the global minimum sum of squared residuals. We establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators considered, and compare their performance in practically relevant sample sizes using simulation. We find that the new hybrid estimator has desirable asymptotic properties and performs very well in finite samples, providing a reliable approach to break date estimation without requiring decisions to be made regarding the autocorrelation properties of the data.",,"UNIT-ROOT,TREND,TESTS,SHIFT,HYPOTHESIS,ROBUST","Harvey, David I.@Univ Nottingham, Granger Ctr Time Series Econometr, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England@Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England::Leybourne, Stephen J.@Univ Nottingham, Granger Ctr Time Series Econometr, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England@Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Harvey, David I.@University of Nottingham::Leybourne, Stephen J.@University of Nottingham","Harvey, David@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7504-6885","Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::Least squares estimation of a shift in linear processes+Bai, Jushan.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1994::no title+Grenander, U; Rosenblatt, M.+STAT ANAL STATIONARY+1957::TESTING FOR A UNIT ROOT IN THE PRESENCE OF A POSSIBLE BREAK IN TREND+Harris, David; Harvey, David I.; Leybourne, Stephen J.; et al.+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+DEC 2009::Break date estimation for models with deterministic structural change+Harvey, D.

Do Danes and Italians Rate Life Satisfaction in the Same Way? Using Vignettes to Correct for Individual-Specific Scale Biases,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12039,OCT 2014,43,22,"Self-reported life satisfaction is highly heterogeneous across similar countries, a phenomenon that may be explained by the different scales and benchmarks that people use to evaluate themselves. This study uses cross-sectional data gathered from older populations in ten European countries to compare estimates from a model that assumes reporting styles are constant across respondents against estimates from a model in which anchoring vignettes help correct for individual-specific scale biases. Variations in response scales explain much of the difference in the raw data. Moreover, the cross-country ranking in life satisfaction depends significantly on scale biases.",,"CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES,ANCHORING VIGNETTES,WORK DISABILITY,UNITED-STATES,PANEL-DATA,HAPPINESS,HEALTH,HAPPY","Angelini, Viola@Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands@Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands::Cavapozzi, Danilo@Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy::Corazzini, Luca@Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Padua, Italy::Paccagnella, Omar@Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, Padua, Italy","Angelini, Viola@University of Groningen::Cavapozzi, Danilo@Universita Ca Foscari Venezia::Corazzini, Luca@University of Padua::Paccagnella, Omar@University of Padua","Cavapozzi, Danilo@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3680-7853","Dynamics of reporting work disability in Europe+Angelini, Viola; Cavapozzi, Danilo; Paccagnella, Omar+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2011::Age, Health and Life Satisfaction Among Older Europeans+Angelini, Viola; Cavapozzi, Danilo; Corazzini, Luca; et al.+SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH+JAN 2012::no title+Bruni, L.; Porta, P.

"Fiscal Foresight, Limited Information and the Effects of Government Spending Shocks",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12036,OCT 2014,36,0,"We quantify the impact of government spending shocks in the US. Thereby, we control for fiscal foresight, a specific limited information problem (LIP) by utilizing the narrative approach. Moreover, we surmount the generic LIP inherent in vector autoregressions (VARs) by a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) approach. We find that a positive deficit-financed defence shock raises output by more than in a VAR (e. g. 2.61 vs. 2.04 for peak multipliers). Furthermore, our evidence suggests that consumption is crowded in. These results are robust to variants of controlling for fiscal foresight and reveal the crucial role of the LIP in fiscal VARs.",,"FACTOR MODELS,MONETARY-POLICY,TIME-SERIES,UNIT-ROOT,IDENTIFICATION,PURCHASES,NUMBER,OUTPUT,TAXES","Fragetta, Matteo@Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy@BRU IUL, Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Lisbon, Portugal::Gasteiger, Emanuel@BRU IUL, Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Dept Econ, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal","Fragetta, Matteo@University of Salerno@Instituto Universitario de Lisboa::Gasteiger, Emanuel@Instituto Universitario de Lisboa","Gasteiger, Emanuel@M-9241-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6043-7181::Fragetta, Matteo@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7764-0813","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Measuring the Output Responses to Fiscal Policy+Auerbach, Alan J.; Gorodnichenko, Yuriy+AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-ECONOMIC POLICY+MAY 2012::Determining the number of factors in approximate factor models+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::Determining the number of primitive shocks in factor models+Bai, Jushan; Ng, Serena+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2007::MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS FROM GOVERNMENT PURCHASES AND TAXES+Barro, Robert J.; Redlick, Charles J.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2011::Measuring the effects of monetary policy: A factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) approach+Bernanke, BS; Boivin, J; Eliasz, P+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2005::An empirical characterization of the dynamic effects of changes in government spending and taxes on output+Blanchard, O; Perotti, R+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2002::Fiscal shocks and their consequences+Burnside, C; Eichenbaum, M; Fisher, JDM+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY+MAR 2004::Monetary policy shocks: What have we learned and to what end?+Christiano, LJ; Eichenbaum, M; Evans, CL+HANDBOOK OF MACROECONOMICS, VOLS 1A-1C+1999::DISTRIBUTION OF THE ESTIMATORS FOR AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES WITH A UNIT ROOT+DICKEY, DA; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::Understanding the effects of a shock to government purchases+Edelberg, W.; Eichenbaum, M.; Fisher, J.

Job Loss and Entrepreneurship,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12042,OCT 2014,24,5,"We examine the impact of job loss on entrepreneurship behaviour. Our identification strategy relies on the use of mass layoffs caused by bankruptcies as indicators of exogenous displacement. Building on Norwegian register data, we find that working in a company which is going to close down due to bankruptcy in the near future raises the subsequent entrepreneur propensity by 155% for men and 180% for women, compared to working in a stable firm. These estimates are much larger than previously reported in the literature. Taking into account that many workers lose their jobs in the comparison group of stable firms also, we suggest that the full effects of displacement are even larger.",,"SELF-EMPLOYMENT,DISPLACEMENT,WORKERS","Roed, Knut@Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway::Skogstrom, Jens Fredrik@Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway","Roed, Knut@Unknow::Skogstrom, Jens Fredrik@Unknow",not exist,"Do the unemployed become successful entrepreneurs?+Andersson, Pemilla; Wadensjoe, Eskil+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER+2007::Explaining International Differences in Entrepreneurship: The Role of Individual Characteristics and Regulatory Constraints+Ardagna, S.; Lusardi, A.+NBER WORKING PAPER S+2008::Estimation of Marginal Effects Using margeff+Bartus, Tamas.+Stata Journal+2005::Entrepreneurship: Origins and returns+Berglann, Helge; Moen, Espen R.; Roed, Knut; et al.+LABOUR ECONOMICS+APR 2011::A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF THE YOUNG SELF-EMPLOYED IN AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED-STATES+BLANCHFLOWER, DG; MEYER, BD+SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS+FEB 1994::Disability in the Welfare State: An Unemployment Problem in Disguise?+Bratsberg, B; Fevang, E.+Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) Discussion Paper No. 4897+2010::Small business formation by unemployed and employed workers+Evans, D.

Area Disparities in Britain: Understanding the Contribution of People vs. Place Through Variance Decompositions,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12043,OCT 2014,16,7,"This article considers methods for decomposing wage variation into individual and group specific components. We discuss the merits of these methods, which are applicable to variance decomposition problems generally. The relative magnitudes of the measures depend on the underlying variances and covariances, and we discuss how to interpret them, and how they might relate to structural parameters of interest. We show that a clear-cut division of variation into area and individual components is impossible. An empirical application to the British labour market demonstrates that labour market area effects contribute very little to the overall variation of wages in Britain.",,"WAGE,FIRMS","Gibbons, Stephen@London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England@London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England::Overman, Henry G.@London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England@London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England::Pelkonen, Panu@Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England","Gibbons, Stephen@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London::Overman, Henry G.@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London::Pelkonen, Panu@University of Sussex","Overman, Henry G.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3525-7629","no title+Abowd, J.

When both reference groups are considered simultaneously, the influence of classmates either disappears or is much reduced, whereas the association between own and friends' behaviours does not change.

Given the ('good luck') macroeconomic trajectories of the 1990s-2000s, the structural reforms that made goods markets more competitive improved the ability of OECD economies to smooth (dis)inflationary shocks, while changes in the monetary policy framework had a modest role in taming inflation during the Great Moderation.",,"EXCHANGE-RATE REGIMES,PHILLIPS-CURVE,LABOR-MARKETS,INSTITUTIONS,MODELS,PRICE,MULTICOUNTRY,PERSISTENCE,OUTCOMES,MATTER","Correa-Lopez, Monica@BBVA Res, Econ Res Dept, Madrid 28046, Spain::Garcia-Serrador, Agustin@BBVA Res, Econ Res Dept, Madrid 28046, Spain::Mingorance-Arnaiz, Cristina@CEU San Pablo Univ, Dept Econ, Madrid 28003, Spain","Correa-Lopez, Monica@Unknow::Garcia-Serrador, Agustin@Unknow::Mingorance-Arnaiz, Cristina@San Pablo CEU University",not exist,"THE PHILLIPS-CURVE, THE PERSISTENCE OF INFLATION, AND THE LUCAS CRITIQUE - EVIDENCE FROM EXCHANGE-RATE REGIMES+ALOGOSKOUFIS, GS; SMITH, R+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1991::Does inflation targeting matter?+Ball, L; Sheridan, N+Inflation-Targeting Debate+2005::The performance of alternative monetary regimes+Ball, L.+HDB MONETARY EC+2011::What policymakers can learn from asset prices+Bernanke, B.+Speech before the investment analyst+2004::What does the Bundesbank target?+Bernanke, BS; Mihov, I+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1997::Macroeconomic effects of regulation and deregulation in goods and labor markets+Blanchard, O; Giavazzi, F+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+AUG 2003::Inflation adjustment and labour market structures: Evidence from a multi-country study+Bowdler, Christopher; Nunziata, Luca+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+2007::no title+Bruno, M.; Sachs, J.+The Economics of Worldwide Stagflation+1985::Exchange rate regimes and shifts in inflation persistence: Does nothing else matter?+Burdekin, RCK; Siklos, PL+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+MAY 1999::Monetary institutions, imperfect competition and employment outcomes+Chouliarakis, George; Correa-Lopez, Monica+NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE+AUG 2011::Monetary policy rules and macroeconomic stability: Evidence and some theory+Clarida, R; Gali, J; Gertler, M+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+FEB 2000::Identifying the influences of nominal and real rigidities in aggregate price-setting behavior+Coenen, Guenter; Levin, Andrew T.; Christoffel, Kai+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+NOV 2007::Drifts and volatilities: monetary policies and outcomes in the post WWIIUS+Cogley, T; Sargent, TJ+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS+APR 2005::Product Market Regulation in the Non- manufacturing Sectors of OECD Countries: Measurement and Highlights+Conway, P.; Nicoletti, G.+Working Paper 58+2006::Monetary institutions, monopolistic competition, unionized labor markets and economic performance+Coricelli, F; Cukierman, A; Dalmazzo, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+2006::Central bank independence, centralization of wage bargaining, inflation and unemployment: Theory and some evidence+Cukierman, A; Lippi, F+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 1999::Consistent covariance matrix estimation with spatially dependent panel data+Driscoll, JC; Kraay, AC+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1998::Estimating the frequency of price re-optimization in Calvo-style models+Eichenbaum, Martin; Fisher, Jonas D.

We estimate Markov switching, threshold autoregressive (TAR) and smooth transition autoregressive (STR) regime switching models and a range of linear specifications including models with GARCH type specifications. Results demonstrate UK asset returns require nonlinear dynamics to be modelled with strong evidence in favour of Markov switching frameworks.

The Dynamics of Humanitarian Aid Decisions,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12033,AUG 2014,40,4,"Humanitarian aid can be seen as a political investment motivated by altruism or by economic benefits for the donor. Uncertainty in the returns to this investment may generate hysteresis effects and inertia in aid allocations. I model the allocation decisions of the three largest humanitarian aid donors: the US government, the UK government and the European Commission, finding evidence that allocations depend on both recipient need and donor economic interest. Some donors exhibit more inertia than others, and some are more influenced by the decisions of other donors. Despite being a relatively small donor, the UK is particularly influential.",,"FOREIGN-POLICY MODEL,BILATERAL AID,DONOR INTERESTS,PANEL-DATA,COLD-WAR,ALLOCATION,FRENCH,DETERMINES,ASSISTANCE,COVERAGE","Fielding, David@Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand","Fielding, David@University of Otago",not exist,"Who gives foreign aid to whom and why?+Alesina, A; Dollar, D+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH+MAR 2000::Aid Strategies of Bilateral Donors+Bermeo, S.

A Distributional Analysis of Earnings Losses of Displaced Workers in an Economic Depression and Recovery,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12028,AUG 2014,26,6,"We study the earnings losses of Finnish private sector workers who lost their jobs at two very different points in the business cycle. The first group was displaced in 1992 (depression period) and the second one in 1997 (recovery period). The focal point of the analysis is the quantile displacement effect, the change in the earnings distribution due to involuntary job separation. We use mass layoffs and plant closures to identify groups of workers who were displaced from exogenous causes. The effect of displacement is strongest at the lower end of the earnings distribution and small or negligible at the upper end.

Extremal dependence measures are here applied to assess the degree of cross-country tail dependence of output growth rates. Our main empirical findings are: (i) cross-country tail dependence is much stronger during periods of large negative growth, than during the ones of large positive growth; (ii) cross-country growth is asymptotically independent; (iii) cross-country tail dependence is considerably stronger than the one arising from a Gaussian dependence model.

"Mismeasured Household Size and Its Implications for the Identification of Economies of Scale (vol 72, pg 246, 2010)",OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12034,AUG 2014,2,0,"We correct an error from Halliday (2010) in which we explored the degree to which household size is measured with errors.

In this note, we summarize some corrections to Halliday (2010). A more detailed version can be found in Appendix S1. Defining e= n*-n, where n* is the true log household size and n is its error-ridden measurement, we note that

sigma(2)(e) = V(e)= V(E[e vertical bar W]) + E(V[e vertical bar W]),

where W equivalent to (N, M, D, B) which are the number of household members, migrants, deaths and births during the survey period. Each of these quantities is in levels and is observable in the data. The first component is commonly referred to as the between component whereas the second component is typically called the within component in the literature on inequality. In the published version, we bounded the between component, but we neglected the within component. Once we correct this, we obtain that these errors could be as high as 20% of the total variation in household size, but this is still not sufficient to resolve the paradox in Deaton and Paxson (1998).",,,"Halliday, Timothy J.@Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA@IZA, Bonn, Germany","Halliday, Timothy J.@University of Hawaii System@IZA Institute Labor Economics@University of Hawaii Manoa",not exist,"Economies of scale, household size, and the demand for food+Deaton, A; Parson, C+JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY+OCT 1998::Mismeasured Household Size and its Implications for the Identification of Economies of Scale+Halliday, Timothy J.+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+APR 2010"
Specification Sensitivity in Right-Tailed Unit Root Testing for Explosive Behaviour,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12026,JUN 2014,21,33,"This article aims to provide some empirical guidelines for the practical implementation of right-tailed unit root tests, focusing on the recursive right-tailed ADF test of Phillips et al. (2011b). We analyze and compare the limit theory of the recursive test under different hypotheses and model specifications. The size and power properties of the test under various scenarios are examined and some recommendations for empirical practice are given. Some new results on the consistent estimation of localizing drift exponents are obtained, which are useful in assessing model specification. Empirical applications to stock markets illustrate these specification issues and reveal their practical importance in testing.",,"TIME-SERIES REGRESSION,BUBBLES,PRICES","Phillips, Peter C.
