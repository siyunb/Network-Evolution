The analysis of repeated measures designs: A review,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711001159357,MAY 2001,85,148,"Repeated measures ANOVA can refer to many different types of analysis. Specifically, this vague term can refer to conventional tests of significance, one of three univariate solutions with adjusted degrees of freedom, two different types of multivariate statistic, or approaches that combine univariate and multivariate tests. Accordingly, it is argued that, by only reporting probability values and referring to statistical analyses as repeated measures ANOVA, authors convey neither the type of analysis that was used nor the validity of the reported probability value, since each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses. The various approaches are presented with a discussion of their strengths and weaknesses, and recommendations are made regarding the 'best' choice of analysis. Additional topics discussed include analyses for missing data and tests of Linear contrasts.",,"GENERAL APPROXIMATION TESTS,PATTERN-MIXTURE MODELS,SPLIT-PLOT DESIGN,REPEATED-MEASURES HYPOTHESES,WELCH-JAMES,MULTISAMPLE SPHERICITY,COVARIANCE MATRICES,EMPIRICAL BAYES,INCOMPLETE DATA,MISSING DATA","Keselman, HJ@Univ Manitoba, Dept Psychol, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada::Algina, J@Univ Manitoba, Dept Psychol, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada::Kowalchuk, RK@Univ Manitoba, Dept Psychol, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA@Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Keselman, HJ@University of Manitoba@State University System of Florida@University of Florida@University of Manitoba::Algina, J@University of Manitoba@State University System of Florida@University of Florida@University of Manitoba::Kowalchuk, RK@University of Manitoba@State University System of Florida@University of Florida@University of Manitoba",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Generalization of Improved General Approximation tests to split-plot designs with multiple between-subjects factors and/or multiple within-subjects factors+Algina, J+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1997::AN IMPROVED GENERAL APPROXIMATION TEST FOR THE MAIN EFFECT IN A SPLIT-PLOT DESIGN+ALGINA, J; OSHIMA, TC+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1995::TYPE-I ERROR RATES FOR HUYNH GENERAL APPROXIMATION AND IMPROVED GENERAL APPROXIMATION TESTS+ALGINA, J; OSHIMA, TC+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1994::A power comparison of the Welch-James and improved general approximation tests in the split-plot design+Algina, J; Keselman, HJ+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SUM 1998::Testing repeated measures hypotheses when covariance matrices are heterogeneous: Revisiting the robustness of the Welch-James test+Algina, J; Keselman, HJ+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1997::SOME ALTERNATIVE APPROXIMATE TESTS FOR A SPLIT-PLOT DESIGN+ALGINA, J+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1994::A review of selected parametric solutions to the Behrens-Fisher problem+Algina, J.; Coombs, W.

All tests make use of the 'sufficient statistics' property the Rasch model possesses. One element of our general class, the test for item bias developed by Holland and Thayer, has been discussed extensively in the psychometric literature.

Inferences about correlations when there is heteroscedasticity,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711001159410,MAY 2001,11,9,"Let (Y-i, X-i), i = 1,..., n, be a random sample from some bivariate distribution, and let rho be the (Pearson) population correlation between X and Y. The usual Student's t test of H-0 :rho = 0 is valid when X and Y are independent, so in particular the conditional variance of Y, given X, does not vary with X. But when the conditional variance does vary with X, Student's t uses an incorrect estimate of the standard error. In effect, when rejecting H-0, this might be due to rho not equal 0, but perhaps the main reason for rejecting is that there is heteroscedasticity. This note compares two heteroscedastic methods for testing H-0 and finds that in terms of Type I errors, the nested bootstrap performed best in simulations when using rho. When using one of two robust analogues of rho (Spearman's rho and the percentage bend correlation), little or no advantage was found, in terms of Type I error probabilities, when using a nested bootstrap versus the basic percentile method. As for power, generally an adjusted percentile bootstrap, used in conjunction with r, performed better than the nested bootstrap, even in situations where, for the null case, the estimated probability of a Type I error was lower when using the adjusted percentile method. As for computing a confidence interval when correlations are positive, situations are found where all methods perform in an unsatisfactory manner.",,"CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT,BOOTSTRAP","Wilcox, RR@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA::Muska, J@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Wilcox, RR@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles::Muska, J@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles","Wilcox, Rand@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2524-2976","MONTE-CARLO APPROXIMATION AND THE ITERATED BOOTSTRAP+BOOTH, JG; HALL, P+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1994::ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::MORE ACCURATE CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS IN EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES+DICICCIO, T; EFRON, B+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1992::MONTE-CARLO STUDY OF ASYMPTOTICALLY ROBUST TESTS FOR CORRELATION-COEFFICIENTS+DUNCAN, GT; LAYARD, MWJ+BIOMETRIKA+1973::Summarizing shape numerically: The g-and-h distribution+Hoaglin, D.

An approximate test such as the Alexander-Govern test or Welch-James type test is then employed to deal with the heterogeneity of cell variance in the non-orthogonal two-way fixed effects completely randomized design.

Modelling dissimilarity: Generalizing ultrametric and additive tree representations,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711001159456,MAY 2001,22,4,"Methods for the hierarchical clustering of an object set produce a sequence of nested partitions such that object classes within each successive partition are constructed from the union of object classes present at the previous level. Any such sequence of nested partitions can in turn be characterized by an ultrametric. An approach to generalizing an (ultrametric) representation is proposed in which the nested character of the partition sequence is relaxed and replaced by the weaker requirement that the classes within each partition contain objects consecutive with respect to a fixed ordering of the objects. A method for fitting such a structure to a given proximity matrix is discussed, along with several alternative strategies for graphical representation. Using this same ultrametric extension, additive tree representations can also be generalized by replacing the ultrametric component in the decomposition of an additive tree (into an ultrametric and a centroid metric).

The algorithm covers promax rotation with or without row normalization of the pre-rotated factor matrix. It also covers situations with either even- or odd-powered promax targets. With some modifications, the algorithm applies to Procrustean rotations with fixed or random independent targets. Simulation results show that the algorithm provides reasonable approximate standard errors for the promax solution with N = 200. In a real data example, the numerical results of the standard error computation using the proposed algorithm match those of an existing method based largely on the augmented information approach.

A minimax procedure in the context of sequential testing problems in psychodiagnostics,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711001159474,MAY 2001,42,2,"The purpose of this paper is to derive optimal rules for sequential testing problems in psychodiagnostics. In sequential psychodiagnostic testing, each time a patient is exposed to a new treatment, the decision then is to declare this new treatment effective, ineffective, or to continue testing and exposing the new treatment to another random patient suffering from the same mental health problem. The framework of minimax sequential decision theory is proposed for solving such testing problems; that is, optimal rules are obtained by minimizing the maximum expected losses associated with all possible decision rules at each stage of testing. The main advantage of this approach is that costs of testing can be explicitly taken into account. The sequential testing procedure is applied to an empirical example for determining the effectiveness of a cognitive-analytic therapy for patients suffering from anorexia nervosa. For a given maximum number of patients to be tested, the appropriate action is indicated at each stage of testing for different numbers of positive reactions to the cognitive-analytic therapy. The paper concludes with a simulation study, in which the minimax sequential strategy is compared for the anorexia nervosa example with other procedures that exist for similar classification decision problems in the literature in terms of average number of patients to be tested, classification accuracy and average loss.",,"MASTERY-SCORES,SELECTION DECISIONS,MODEL,UTILITY","Vos, HJ@Univ Twente, Fac Educ Sci & Technol, Dept Educ Measurement & Data Anal, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands","Vos, HJ@University of Twente",not exist,"Scales, norms and equivalent scores+Angoff, W.

Conditional local influence in case-weights linear regression,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711001159375,MAY 2001,21,7,"The local influence approach proposed by Cook (1986) makes use of the normal curvature and the direction achieving the maximum curvature to assess the local influence of minor perturbation of statistical models. When the approach is applied to the linear regression model, the result provides information concerning the data structure different from that contributed by Cook's distance. One of the main advantages of the local influence approach is its ability to handle the simultaneous effect of several cases, namely, the ability to address the problem of 'masking'. However, Lawrance (1995) points out that there are two notions of 'masking' effects, the joint influence and the conditional influence, which are distinct in nature.

Bradley-Terry-Luce models to incorporate within-pair order effects: Representation and uniqueness theorems,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/0007110042307195,NOV 2004,13,5,"The paper presents different representation theorems for the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) models of Beaver and Gokhale and of Davidson and Beaver. In particular, algorithms that can be used in constructing BTL scales are provided. The uniqueness theorems show that the Davidson-Beaver model should be preferred to the Beaver-Gokhale model since the multiplicative order effect parameter is uniquely determined whereas the additive effect parameter is merely a ratio scale. Finally, a relationship to the simple BTL model is established. Let p(a, b) denote the probability that a is chosen when (a, b) is presented in a fixed order. Then the probabilities p(a, b) satisfy the Beaver-Gokhale model if and only if the balanced probabilities p(b)(a,b):= 1/2(p(a, b) + 1 - p(b,a)) satisfy the simple BTL model.",,,"Augustin, T@Graz Univ, Graz, Austria","Augustin, T@University of Graz",not exist,"MODEL TO INCORPORATE WITHIN-PAIR ORDER EFFECTS IN PAIRED COMPARISONS+BEAVER, RJ; GOKHALE, DV+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS+1975::no title+BOSSUYT PM+NEW DEV PSYCHOL CHOI+1989::RANK ANALYSIS OF INCOMPLETE BLOCK DESIGNS .1.

A generalized estimating equations approach to mixed-effects ordinal probit models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/0007110042307177,NOV 2004,39,1,"Clustered ordinal responses, which are commonplace in behavioural and educational research, are often analysed using mixed-effects ordinal probit models. Likelihood-based inference for these models can be computationally burdensome, and may compromise the consistency of estimators if the model is misspecified. We propose an alternative inferential approach based on generalized estimating equations. We show that systems of estimating equations can be specified for mixed-effects ordinal probit models that avoid the potentially heavy computational demands of maximum likelihood estimation, and can also provide inferences that are robust with respect to some forms of model misspecification-particularly serial effects in longitudinal data.",,"CORRELATED BINARY REGRESSION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,CATEGORICAL-DATA,LINEAR-MODELS,RESPONSE DATA,INFERENCE","Johnson, TR@Univ Idaho, Dept Stat, Moscow, ID 83844 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Educ Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA::Kim, JS@Univ Idaho, Dept Stat, Moscow, ID 83844 USA@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Educ Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Johnson, TR@University of Idaho@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison::Kim, JS@University of Idaho@University of Wisconsin System@University of Wisconsin Madison",not exist,"MULTIPERIOD PROBIT MODELS AND ORTHOGONALITY CONDITION ESTIMATION+AVERY, RB; HANSEN, LP; HOTZ, VJ+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+1983::FULL-INFORMATION ITEM FACTOR-ANALYSIS+BOCK, RD; GIBBONS, R; MURAKI, E+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1988::ON THE USE OF A WORKING CORRELATION MATRIX IN USING GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS FOR REPEATED-MEASURES+CROWDER, M+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1995::On repeated measures analysis with misspecified covariance structure+Crowder, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::TESTING FOR RANDOM DROPOUTS IN REPEATED MEASUREMENT DATA+DIGGLE, PJ+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1989::no title+DOORNIK JA+OX OBJECTED ORIENTED+2001::no title+Elliott, D.

However, kappa performs poorly when the marginal distributions are very asymmetric, it is not easy to interpret, and its definition is based on hypothesis of independence of the responses (which is more restrictive than the hypothesis that kappa has a value of zero). This paper defines a new measure of agreement, delta, 'the proportion of agreements that are not due to chance', which comes from model of multiple-choice tests and does not have the previous limitations. The paper shows that kappa and delta generally take very similar values, except when the marginal distributions are strongly unbalanced.

On the chi-square approximation to the exact distribution of goodness-of-fit statistics in multinomial models with composite hypotheses,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711004849240,MAY 2004,14,3,"Multinomial models are increasingly being used in psychology, and this use always requires estimating model parameters and testing goodness of fit with a composite null hypothesis. Goodness of fit is customarily tested with recourse to the asymptotic approximation to the distribution of the statistics. An assessment of the quality of this approximation requires a comparison with the exact distribution, but how to compute this exact distribution when parameters are estimated from the data appears never to have been defined precisely. The main goal of this paper is to compare two different approaches to defining this exact distribution. One of the approaches uses the marginal distribution and is, therefore, independent of the data; the other approach uses the conditional distribution of the statistics given the estimated parameters and, therefore, is data-dependent. We carried out a thorough study involving various parameter estimation methods and goodness-of-fit statistics, all of them members of the general class of power-divergence measures. Included in the study were multinomial models with three to five cells and up to three parameters. Our results indicate that the asymptotic distribution is rarely a good approximation to the exact marginal distribution of the statistics, whereas it is a good approximation to the exact conditional distribution only when the vector of expected frequencies is interior to the sample space of the multinomial distribution.",,"SMALL-SAMPLE COMPARISONS,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,TESTS","Garcia-Perez, MA@Univ Complutense, Fac Psicol, Dept Metodol, Madrid 28223, Spain@Univ Basque Country, Dept Econometria & Estadist, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain::Nunez-Anton, V@Univ Complutense, Fac Psicol, Dept Metodol, Madrid 28223, Spain@Univ Basque Country, Dept Econometria & Estadist, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain","Garcia-Perez, MA@Complutense University of Madrid@University of Basque Country::Nunez-Anton, V@Complutense University of Madrid@University of Basque Country","Nunez-Anton, Vicente@H-6953-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4395-0941::Garcia-Perez, Miguel Angel@F-7043-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2669-4429","TESTS OF GOODNESS OF FIT+ANSCOMBE, FJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1963::METHODS FOR EXACT GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS+BAGLIVO, J; OLIVIER, D; PAGANO, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::Theoretical and empirical review of multinomial process tree modeling+Batchelder, WH; Riefer, DM+PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN &amp; REVIEW+MAR 1999::MULTINOMIAL GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS+CRESSIE, N; READ, TRC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1984::MPROB: Computation of multinomial probabilities+Garcia-Perez, MA+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS INSTRUMENTS &amp; COMPUTERS+NOV 1999::Exact finite-sample significance and confidence regions for goodness-of-fit statistics in one-way multinomials+Garcia-Perez, MA+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 2000::Small-sample comparisons for power-divergence goodness-of-it statistics for symmetric and skewed simple null hypotheses+Garcia-Perez, MA; Nunez-Anton, V+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+SEP 2001::PARAMETER-ESTIMATION AND GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTING IN MULTINOMIAL MODELS+GARCIAPEREZ, MA+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1994::SMALL-SAMPLE COMPARISONS OF EXACT LEVELS FOR CHI-SQUARED GOODNESS-OF-FIT STATISTICS+LARNTZ, K+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1978::no title+no author+NAG Fortran library manual, mark 19+1999::no title+READ TRC+GOODNESS FIT STAT DI+1988::AN IMPROVED GOODNESS-OF-FIT STATISTIC FOR SPARSE MULTINOMIALS+SIMONOFF, JS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::A novel extension of the triangular distribution and its parameter estimation+van Dorp, JR; Kotz, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+2002::SOLVING SYSTEMS OF NONLINEAR EQUATIONS USING THE NONZERO VALUE OF THE TOPOLOGICAL-DEGREE+VRAHATIS, MN+ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE+DEC 1988"

The general statistical properties of the d-effect size are derived, extending Hedges's statement of zero-order properties. These general properties have direct relevance in the synthesis of a set of independent effect sizes arising from empirical studies predicated on a common theoretical model. We discuss possible solutions to the problem of comparing effect sizes arising from models employing differing sets of covariates. We apply the general statistical properties in the synthesis of gender performance differences in first-level economics courses at three New Zealand universities.

Bayesian model comparison of nonlinear structural equation models with missing continuous and ordinal categorical data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711004849204,MAY 2004,43,28,"Missing data are very common in behavioural and psychological research. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach in the context of a general nonlinear structural equation model with missing continuous and ordinal categorical data. In the development, the missing data are treated as latent quantities, and provision for the incompleteness of the data is made by a hybrid algorithm that combines the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We show by means of a simulation study that the Bayesian estimates are accurate. A Bayesian model comparison procedure based on the Bayes factor and path sampling is proposed. The required observations from the posterior distribution for computing the Bayes factor are simulated by the hybrid algorithm in Bayesian estimation. Our simulation results indicate that the correct model is selected more frequently when the incomplete records are used in the analysis than when they are ignored. the methodology is further illustrated with a real data set from a study concerned with an AIDS preventative intervention for Filipina sex workers.",,"LATENT VARIABLE MODELS,POLYTOMOUS DATA,POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD,DATA AUGMENTATION,LINEAR-MODELS,APPROXIMATIONS,REGRESSION,SIMULATION,OUTCOMES","Lee, SY@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Zhongshan Univ, Dept Stat, Zhongshan, Peoples R China::Song, XY@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Zhongshan Univ, Dept Stat, Zhongshan, Peoples R China","Lee, SY@Chinese University of Hong Kong@Sun Yat Sen University::Song, XY@Chinese University of Hong Kong@Sun Yat Sen University",not exist,"no title+ALLISON PD+SOCIOL METHODOL+1987::A Bayesian approach to nonlinear latent variable models using the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm+Arminger, G+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::STATE VERSUS ACTION ORIENTATION AND THE THEORY OF REASONED ACTION - AN APPLICATION TO COUPON USAGE+BAGOZZI, RP; BAUMGARTNER, H; YI, YJ+JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH+MAR 1992::no title+Bentler, P.

Three Mahalanobis distances and their role in assessing unidimensionality,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711004849231,MAY 2004,46,13,"Unidimensionality is the hallmark psychometric feature of a well-constructed measurement scale. However, in determining the degree to which a set of items form a unidimensional scale, aberrant item response patterns may distort our investigations. For example, aberrant response patterns may adversely impact inter-item covariances which, in turn, can distort estimates of a scale's dimensionality and reliability. In this study, we investigate and compare the utility of three Mahalanobis distance (M-distance) measures in identifying and downweighting aberrant item response patterns. Our findings indicated that a residual-based M-distance measure had the best properties. Specifically, response patterns having greater residual-based M-distances were responsible for observed violations of unidimensionality. When these response patterns were properly downweighted according to this M-distance, the data fitted a one-factor model better and scale reliability increased. The procedures are illustrated using three real data sets.",,"STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,MULTIVARIATE LOCATION,APPROPRIATENESS MEASUREMENT,SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS,LEVERAGE POINTS,M-ESTIMATORS,OUTLIERS,MATRICES,IDENTIFICATION","Yuan, KH@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA::Fung, WK@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA::Reise, SR@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Yuan, KH@University of Notre Dame@University of Hong Kong@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System::Fung, WK@University of Notre Dame@University of Hong Kong@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System::Reise, SR@University of Notre Dame@University of Hong Kong@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"no title+Allen, M.

A note on preliminary tests of equality of variances,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711004849222,MAY 2004,24,82,"Preliminary tests of equality of variances used before a test of location are no longer widely recommended by statisticians, although they persist in some textbooks and software packages. The present study extends the findings of previous studies and provides further reasons for discontinuing the use of preliminary tests. The study found Type I error rates of a two-stage procedure, consisting of a preliminary Levene test on samples of different sizes with unequal variances, followed by either a Student pooled-variances t test or a Welch separate-variances t test. Simulations disclosed that the two-stage procedure fails to protect the significance level and usually makes the situation worse. Earlier studies have shown that preliminary tests often adversely affect the size of the test, and also that the Welch test is superior to the t test when variances are unequal. The present simulations reveal that changes in Type I error rates are greater when sample sizes are smaller, when the difference in variances is slight rather than extreme, and when the significance level is more stringent. Furthermore, the validity of the Welch test deteriorates if it is used only on those occasions where a preliminary test indicates it is needed. Optimum protection is assured by using a separate-variances test unconditionally whenever sample sizes are unequal.",,"T-TEST,ROBUST,HOMOGENEITY,POWER","Zimmerman, DW@Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Zimmerman, DW@Carleton University",not exist,"The asymptotic behavior of tests for normal means based on a variance pre-test+Albers, W; Boon, PC; Kallenberg, WCM+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 2000::Hypothesis testing incorporating a preliminary test of significance+Arnold, Barry C.+Journal of the American Statistical Association+1970::ANALYSIS + INFERENCE FOR INCOMPLETELY SPECIFIED MODELS INVOLVING USE OF PRELIMINARY TEST(S) OF SIGNIFICANCE+BANCROFT, TA+BIOMETRICS+1964::Properties of sufficiency and statistical tests+Bartlett, MS+PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES+MAY 1937::BOOTSTRAP METHODS FOR TESTING HOMOGENEITY OF VARIANCES+BOOS, DD; BROWNIE, C+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1989::Robust tests for the Equality of Variances+BROWN, M.

The key idea is to treat the latent variables as hypothetical missing data and then apply Cook's approach to the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function in the corresponding EM algorithm for deriving the normal curvature and the conformal normal curvature. Building blocks for achieving the diagnostic measures are computed via observations generated by the Gibbs sampler. It is shown that the proposed methodology is relatively simple to implement, computationally efficient, and feasible for a wide variety of perturbation schemes.

Direct fit of a theoretical model of phase transition in oscillatory finger motions,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003770480002,NOV 2003,26,25,This paper presents a general method to fit the Schoner-Haken-Kelso (SHK) model of human movement phase transitions directly to time series data. A robust variant of the extended Kalman filter technique is applied to the data of a single subject. The options of covariance resetting and iteration within recursion were used to obtain time-dependent estimates of both the alpha and beta parameters in the SHK model. Comparison between transition onset time and the time at which \beta(t\T)/alpha(t\T)\ becomes critical indicates that the transitions are advanced by noise. The method can be extended to handle non-normal data and generalization across subjects and/or experimental conditions.,,"MOVEMENT,COORDINATION","Molenaar, PCM@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Newell, KM@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Molenaar, PCM@University of Amsterdam@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Newell, KM@University of Amsterdam@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University",not exist,"no title+Arnold, L.+Random Dynamical Systems+1998::no title+Chen, G.+Approximate Kalman Filtering+1993::no title+FAHRMEIR L+MULTIVARIATE STAT MO+1994::On the arithmetic means and variances of products and ratios of random variables+Frishman, F.+Statistical distributions in scientific work, volume I: models and structures+1975::Extending the HKB model of coordinated movement to oscillators with different eigenfrequencies+Fuchs, A; Jirsa, VK; Haken, H; et al.+BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS+JAN 1996::A THEORETICAL NOTE ON MODELS OF INTERLIMB COORDINATION+FUCHS, A; KELSO, JAS+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE+OCT 1994::no title+Gardiner, CW.+HDB STOCHASTIC METHO+1990::no title+Goodwin, G.

The structure of self-reported emotional experiences: A mixed-effects Poisson factor model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003770480011,NOV 2003,40,3,"Multivariate count data are commonly analysed by using Poisson distributions with varying intensity parameters, resulting in a random-effects model. In the analysis of a data set on the frequency of different emotion experiences we find that a Poisson model with a single random effect does not yield an adequate fit. An alternative model that requires as many random effects as emotion categories requires high-dimensional integration and the estimation of a large number of parameters. As a solution to these computational problems, we propose a factor-analytic Poisson model and show that a two-dimensional factor model fits the reported data very well. Moreover, it yields a substantively satisfactory solution: one factor describing the degree of pleasantness and unpleasantness of emotions and the other factor describing the activation levels of the emotions. We discuss the incorporation of covariates to facilitate rigorous tests of the random-effects structure. Marginal maximum likelihood methods lead to straightforward estimation of the model, for which goodness-of-fit tests are also presented.",,"MULTINOMIAL REGRESSION-MODELS,5-FACTOR MODEL,TRAITS","Bockenholt, U@Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands@Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA@Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Kamakura, WA@Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands@Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA@Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA::Wedel, M@Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands@Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA@Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Bockenholt, U@University of Groningen@Duke University@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Kamakura, WA@University of Groningen@Duke University@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan::Wedel, M@University of Groningen@Duke University@University of Michigan System@University of Michigan",not exist,"THE MULTIVARIATE POISSON-LOG NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION+AITCHISON, J; HO, CH+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1989::FACTOR-ANALYSIS AND AIC+AKAIKE, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::no title+*APT SYST INC+GAUSS+1995::EMOTIONAL INTENSITY - MEASUREMENT AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS+BACHOROWSKI, JA; BRAATEN, EB+PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES+AUG 1994::no title+Bartholomew, DJ; Knott, M.+Latent variable models and factor analysis+1999::Analyzing multiple emotions over time by autoregressive negative multinomial regression models+Bockenholt, U+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1999::MODEL SELECTION AND AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) - THE GENERAL-THEORY AND ITS ANALYTICAL EXTENSIONS+BOZDOGAN, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::no title+BURNHAM, K; ANDERSON, D.+Model selection and inference: a practical information-theoretic approach+1998::no title+Cameron, A; Trivedi, P.+Regression Analysis of Count Data+1998::THE USE OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES IN X2 TESTS FOR GOODNESS OF FIT+CHERNOFF, H; LEHMANN, EL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1954::no title+Costa Jr, P.

Weak measurement invariance with respect to unmeasured variables: An implication of strict factorial invariance,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003770480020,NOV 2003,19,25,"Measurement bias refers to systematic differences across subpopulations in the relation between observed test scores and the latent variant underlying the test scores. Comparisons of subpopulations with the same score on the latent variable can be expected to have the same observed test score. Measurement invariance is therefore one of the key issues in psychological testing. It has been established that strict factorial invariance (SFI) with respect to a selection variable V almost certainly implies weak measurement invariance with respect to V: given SFI, means and variances of observed scores do not depend on V. It is shown that this result can be extended. SFI in groups derived by selection on V has implications not only for V but also for potentially biasing variables W, if W and the selection variable V and/or if W and the factor underlying the observed test scores are statistically dependent. Given SFI with respect to V and prior knowledge concerning these dependencies, it is not necessary to measure and model variables W in order to exclude them as potentially biasing variables if the investigation focuses on groups selected on V.",,PATTERNS,"Lubke, GH@Univ Calif Los Angeles, GSEIS, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands@Free Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Dolan, CV@Univ Calif Los Angeles, GSEIS, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands@Free Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Kelderman, H@Univ Calif Los Angeles, GSEIS, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands@Free Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands::Mellenbergh, GJ@Univ Calif Los Angeles, GSEIS, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands@Free Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Lubke, GH@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles@University of Amsterdam@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam::Dolan, CV@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles@University of Amsterdam@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam::Kelderman, H@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles@University of Amsterdam@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam::Mellenbergh, GJ@University of California System@University of California Los Angeles@University of Amsterdam@Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam",not exist,"ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO FACTORIAL INVARIANCE+BLOXOM, B+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1972::Investigating Spearman's hypothesis by means of multi-group confirmatory factor analysis+Dolan, CV+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+2000::SUBPOPULATION INVARIANCE OF PATTERNS IN COVARIANCE MATRICES+ELLIS, JL+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1993::RACE, SOCIAL-CLASS AND ABILITY PATTERNS ON THE WISC-R+JENSEN, AR; REYNOLDS, CR+PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES+1982::no title+Joreskog, K.

Type I errors and power of the parametric bootstrap goodness-of-fit test: Full and limited information,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003770480048,NOV 2003,30,23,"In sparse tables for categorical data well-known goodness-of-fit statistics are not chi-square distributed. A consequence is that model selection becomes a problem. It has been suggested that a way out of this problem is the use of the parametric bootstrap. In this paper, the parametric bootstrap goodness-of-fit test is studied by means of an extensive simulation study; the Type I error rates and power of this test are studied under several conditions of sparseness. In the presence of sparseness, models were used that were likely to violate the regularity conditions. Besides bootstrapping the goodness-of-fit usually used (full information statistics), corrected versions of these statistics and a limited information statistic are bootstrapped. These bootstrap tests were also compared to an asymptotic test using limited information. Results indicate that bootstrapping the usual statistics fails because these tests are too liberal, and that bootstrapping or asymptotically testing the limited information statistic works better with respect to Type I error and outperforms the other statistics by far in terms of statistical power. The properties of all tests are illustrated using categorical Markov models.",,"EXPECTED FREQUENCIES,MODEL,VARIABLES,TABLES","Tollenaar, N@Leiden Univ, Dept Psychol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands::Mooijaart, A@Leiden Univ, Dept Psychol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Tollenaar, N@Leiden University::Mooijaart, A@Leiden University",not exist,"An empirical investigation of some effects of sparseness in contingency tables+Agresti, A; Yang, M.+Computational Statistics Data Anal+1986::STATISTICAL MODELING OF DATA ON TEACHING STYLES+AITKIN, M; ANDERSON, D; HINDE, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1981::NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::A goodness of fit test for sparse 2(p) contingency tables+Bartholomew, DJ; Leung, SO+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2002::The goodness of fit of latent trait models in attitude measurement+Bartholomew, DJ; Tzamourani, P+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1999::BOOTSTRAPPING GOODNESS-OF-FIT MEASURES IN STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS+BOLLEN, KA; STINE, RA+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+NOV 1992::MODEL SELECTION AND AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) - THE GENERAL-THEORY AND ITS ANALYTICAL EXTENSIONS+BOZDOGAN, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::FACTOR-ANALYSIS OF DICHOTOMIZED VARIABLES+CHRISTOFFERSSON, A+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1975::SOME COMMON PROBLEMS IN LOG-LINEAR ANALYSIS+CLOGG, CC; ELIASON, SR+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+AUG 1987::no title+Cohen, J.+Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences+1988::GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTING FOR LATENT CLASS MODELS+COLLINS, LM; FIDLER, PL; WUGALTER, SE; et al.+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1993::MULTINOMIAL GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS+CRESSIE, N; READ, TRC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1984::Random number generation for the new century+Deng, LY; Lin, DKJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2000::no title+Efron,, B.+The jackknife, the bootstrap, and other resampling plans+1982::TRANSFORMATIONS RELATED TO THE ANGULAR AND THE SQUARE ROOT+FREEMAN, MF; TUKEY, JW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1950::no title+Holland, P; Bishop, Y.; Fienberg, S.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis: Theory and Practice.+1975::Tables of maximally equidistributed combined LFSR generators+L'ecuyer, P+MATHEMATICS OF COMPUTATION+JAN 1999::Latent variables Markov models+Langeheine, R.+Latent Variables Analysis+1994::Bootstrapping goodness-of-fit measures in categorical data analysis+Langeheine, R; Pannekoek, J; VandePol, F+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1996::A UNIFYING FRAMEWORK FOR MARKOV MODELING IN DISCRETE SPACE AND DISCRETE-TIME+LANGEHEINE, R; VANDEPOL, F+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1990::CONTRIBUTIONS TO FACTOR-ANALYSIS OF DICHOTOMOUS VARIABLES+MUTHEN, B+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1978::no title+READ TRC+GOODNESS FIT STAT DI+1988::VALIDITY OF THE CHI-SQUARE TEST IN DICHOTOMOUS VARIABLE FACTOR-ANALYSIS WHEN EXPECTED FREQUENCIES ARE SMALL+REISER, M; VANDENBERG, M+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1994::Analysis of residuals for the multinomial item response model+Reiser, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1996::A goodness-of-fit test for the latent class model when expected frequencies are small+Reiser, M; Lin, YC+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 1999, VOL 29+1999::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::no title+VANDERARK LA+THESIS U UTRECHT NET+1999::no title+VANDERHEIJDEN PGM+APPL LATENT TRAIT LA+1997::no title+VONDAVIER M+METHODS PSYCHOL RES+1997::no title+VONDAVIER M+THESIS U KIEL GERMAN+1996"

Three-mode analysis of multimode covariance matrices,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003770480066,NOV 2003,45,11,"Multimode covariance matrices, such as multitrait-multimethod matrices, contain the covariances of subject scores on variables for different occasions or conditions. This paper presents a comparison of three-mode component analysis and three-mode factor analysis applied to such covariance matrices. The differences and similarities between the non-stochastic and stochastic approaches are demonstrated by two examples, one of which has a longitudinal design. The empirical comparison is facilitated by deriving, as a heuristic device, a statistic based on the maximum likelihood function for three-mode factor analysis and its associated degrees of freedom for the three-mode component models. Furthermore, within the present context a case is made for interpreting the core array as second-order components.",,"MULTITRAIT-MULTIMETHOD MATRICES,FACTOR-ANALYSIS MODEL,COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS,NUMBERS,BEHAVIOR,ERROR","Kroonenberg, PM@Leiden Univ, Dept Educ, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands@Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Psychol Med, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands::Oort, FJ@Leiden Univ, Dept Educ, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands@Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Psychol Med, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands","Kroonenberg, PM@Leiden University@Academic Medical Center Amsterdam@University of Amsterdam::Oort, FJ@Leiden University@Academic Medical Center Amsterdam@University of Amsterdam",not exist,"no title+ANTONIDES G+ADV EC PSYCHOL+1997::Representation of measurement error in marketing variables: Review of approaches and extension to three-facet designs+Bagozzi, RP; Yi, YJ; Nassen, KD+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR-APR 1999::no title+Bentler, P.

In the current study, we propose a modified a-stratified method, the a-stratified method with content blocking. As a further refinement of a-stratified CAT designs, the new method incorporates content specifications into item pool stratification. Simulation studies were conducted to compare the new method with three previous item selection methods: the G-stratified method; the a-stratified with b-blocking method; and the maximum Fisher information method with Sympson-Hetter exposure control. The results indicated that the refined a-stratified design performed well in reducing item overexposure rates, balancing item usage within the pool, and maintaining measurement precision, in a situation where all four procedures were forced to balance content.",,"ITEM SELECTION,ABILITY,SCALE","Yi, Q@ACT Inc, Iowa City, IA 52243 USA@Univ Texas, Austin, TX 78712 USA@Jiangxi Normal Univ, Jiangxi, Peoples R China::Chang, HH@ACT Inc, Iowa City, IA 52243 USA@Univ Texas, Austin, TX 78712 USA@Jiangxi Normal Univ, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Yi, Q@Unknow@University of Texas System@University of Texas Austin@Jiangxi Normal University::Chang, HH@Unknow@University of Texas System@University of Texas Austin@Jiangxi Normal University",not exist,"no title+BAN J+ANN M PSYCH SOC LAWR+1999::a-stratified multistage computerized adaptive testing with b blocking+Chang, HH; Qian, JH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 2001::a-stratified multistage computerized adaptive testing+Chang, HH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1999::A global information approach to computerized adoptive testing+Chang, HH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1996::Hypergeometric family and item overlap rates in computerized adaptive testing+Chang, HH; Zhang, JM+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::no title+CHANG S+ANN M AM ED RES ASS+2000::no title+CHANG S+ANN M AM ED RES ASS+1999::no title+DAVEY T+C COMP BAS TEST BUIL+1998::New algorithms for item selection and exposure control with computerized adaptive testing+Davey, T; Parshall, CG.+ANN M AM ED RES ASS+1995::Item selection in computerized adaptive testing: Should more discriminating items be used first?+Hau, KT; Chang, HH+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+FAL 2001::Item exposure control in CAT-ASVAB+Hetter, R.

In particular, the index has an intuitive interpretation that does not depend upon the specific nature of the model being assessed and is not sensitive to sample size. Also, the index can be applied when models are fitted to virtually any frequency table. This paper summarizes the underlying theory and addresses issues of estimation for goodness-of-fit tests for one-way or multi-way frequency tables as well as for certain latent variable models. In addition, a new approach for estimating a lower confidence bound for the index is presented.",,"LATENT STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,MODEL","Dayton, CM@Univ Maryland, Dept Measurement & Stat, Coll Educ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Dayton, CM@University of Maryland College Park@University System of Maryland",not exist,"A new index of structure for the analysis of models for mobility tables and other cross-classification+Clogg, C.

Theory and simulations indicate that little power is lost under normality when using trimmed means rather than untrimmed means, and trimmed means can result in substantially higher power when sampling from a heavy-tailed distribution. However, trimmed means suffer from two practical concerns described in this paper. Replacing trimmed means with a robust M-estimator addresses these concerns, but control over the probability of a Type I error can be unsatisfactory when the sample size is small. Methods based on a simple modification of a one-step M-estimator that address the problems with trimmed means are examined.

A method of moments technique for fitting interaction effects in structural equation models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003321645331,MAY 2003,18,26,"The desire to fit structural equation models containing an interaction term has received much methodological attention in the social science literature. This paper presents a technique for the cross-product structural model that utilizes factor score estimates and results in closed-form moments-type estimators. The technique, which does not require normality for the underlying factors, was originally introduced in a very general form by Wall and Amemiya. (2000) for any polynomial structural model. In this paper, the practical implementation of this method, including standard error estimation, is presented specifically for the cross-product model. The procedure is applied to an example from social/behavioural epidemiology where the flexibility of the cross-product model provides a useful description of the underlying theory. A simulation study is also presented comparing the method of moments, for the cross-product model with three other procedures.",,LATENT-VARIABLES,"Wall, MM@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA::Amemiya, Y@Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA@Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Wall, MM@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@Iowa State University::Amemiya, Y@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System@Iowa State University",not exist,"A Bayesian approach to nonlinear latent variable models using the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm+Arminger, G+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::no title+BANDURA A+SOCIAL FDN THOUGHT A+1986::Interactions of latent variables in structural equation models+Bollen, K.

Stochastic EM for estimating the parameters of a multilevel IRT model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003321645340,MAY 2003,37,11,An item response theory (IRT) model is used as a measurement error model for the dependent variable of a multilevel model. The dependent variable is latent but can be measured indirectly by using tests or questionnaires. The advantage of using latent scores as dependent variables of a multilevel model is that it offers the possibility of modelling response variation and measurement error and separating the influence of item difficulty and ability level. The two-parameter normal ogive model is used for the IRT model. It is shown that the stochastic EM algorithm can be used to estimate the parameters which are close to the maximum likelihood estimates. This algorithm is easily implemented. The estimation procedure will be compared to an implementation of the Gibbs sampler in a Bayesian framework. Examples using real data are given.,,"GIBBS SAMPLER,ALGORITHM,REGRESSION,SCHEMES","Fox, JP@Univ Twente, Dept Educ Measurement & Data Anal, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands","Fox, JP@University of Twente",not exist,"Multilevel item response models: An approach to errors in variables regression+Adams, RJ; Wilson, M; Wu, M+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SPR 1997::BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION OF NORMAL OGIVE ITEM RESPONSE CURVES USING GIBBS SAMPLING+ALBERT, JH+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+FAL 1992::ESTIMATING LATENT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN REPEATED TESTINGS+ANDERSEN, EB+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1985::Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum,, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::no title+BOX, G.

An enhanced branch-and-bound algorithm for a partitioning problem,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003321645359,MAY 2003,12,24,"This paper focuses on the problem of developing a partition of n objects based on the information in a symmetric, non-negative dissimilarity matrix. The goal is to partition the objects into a set of non-overlapping subsets with the objective of minimizing the sum of the within-subset dissimilarities. Optimal solutions to this problem can be obtained using dynamic programming, branch-and-bound and other mathematical programming methods. An improved branch-and-bound algorithm is shown to be particularly efficient. The improvements include better upper bounds that are obtained via a fast exchange algorithm and, more importantly, sharper lower bounds obtained through sequential solution of submatrices. A modified version of the branch-and-bound algorithm for minimizing the diameter of a partition is also presented. Computational results for both synthetic and empirical dissimilarity matrices reveal the effectiveness of the branch-and-bound methodology.",,"CLUSTER-ANALYSIS,CUT","Brusco, MJ@Florida State Univ, Dept Mkt, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Brusco, MJ@Florida State University@State University System of Florida",not exist,"AN ADDITIVE ALGORITHM FOR SOLVING LINEAR PROGRAMS WITH 0-1 VARIABLES+BALAS, E+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+1965::A transfer algorithm for non-hierarchical classification+Banfield, C.F.; Bassill, L.C.+Applied Statistics+1977::no title+GORDON, A.D.+Classification+1981::Cluster analysis and mathematical programming+Hansen, P; Jaumard, B+MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING+OCT 1 1997::SOLVING AIRLINE CREW SCHEDULING PROBLEMS BY BRANCH-AND-CUT+HOFFMAN, KL; PADBERG, M+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+JUN 1993::no title+HUBERT L+COMBINATORIAL DATA A+2001::SOME APPLICATIONS OF GRAPH THEORY TO CLUSTERING+HUBERT, LJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1974::MIN-CUT CLUSTERING+JOHNSON, EL; MEHROTRA, A; NEMHAUSER, GL+MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING+OCT 21 1993::OPTIMAL CLUSTERING - A MODEL AND METHOD+KLEIN, G; ARONSON, JE+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+JUN 1991::CLUSTER ANALYSIS AND MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING+RAO, MR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::Food for thought: Cross-classification and category organization in a complex real-world domain+Ross, BH; Murphy, GL+COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY+JUN 1999::no title+Zupan, J.+Clustering of large data sets+1982"
Bootstrap approach to inference and power analysis based on three test statistics for covariance structure models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003321645368,MAY 2003,48,68,"We study several aspects of bootstrap inference for covariance structure models based on three test statistics, including Type I error, power and sample-size determination. Specifically, we discuss conditions for a test statistic to achieve a more accurate level of Type I error, both in theory and in practice. Details on power analysis and sample-size determination are given. For data sets with heavy tails, we propose applying a bootstrap methodology to a transformed sample by a downweighting procedure. One of the key conditions for safe bootstrap inference is generally satisfied by the transformed sample but may not be satisfied by the original sample with heavy tails. Several data sets illustrate that, by combining downweighting and bootstrapping, a researcher may find a nearly optimal procedure for evaluating various aspects of covariance structure models. A rule for handling non-convergence problems in bootstrap replications is proposed.",,"SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS,ROBUSTNESS,MATRICES,SCATTER","Yuan, KH@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Lab Social Res, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA::Hayashi, K@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Lab Social Res, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA","Yuan, KH@University of Notre Dame@Georgia State University@University System of Georgia::Hayashi, K@University of Notre Dame@Georgia State University@University System of Georgia",not exist,"ASYMPTOTIC CHI-SQUARE TESTS FOR A LARGE CLASS OF FACTOR-ANALYSIS MODELS+AMEMIYA, Y; ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1990::BARTLETT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO STATISTIC AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, OE; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1984::no title+Bentler, P.

An asymptotic partial correlation test for the Goodman-Kruskal lambda,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003321645377,MAY 2003,8,0,"Goodman and Kruskal introduced a measure of predictive association when predicting the category of a variable A from a category of a variable B. This measure, denoted lambda, is the asymmetric proportional reduction in error measure in predicting an individual's A category that can be eliminated by using knowledge of the B classification. It takes values on the unit interval, with a zero value meaning no predictive gain, while a value of unity indicates a perfect predictive association between A and B. A test of H-0: lambda = 0 versus H-1: lambda > 0 is analogous to a test for the significance of the correlation coefficient. A test of the partial lambda coefficient, which is analogous to a test of the partial correlation coefficient, answers the question of whether knowledge of an additional third (or higher) classification or categorical variable results in a significant increase in predicting the variable A. Suich and Turek developed an exact test for the partial lambda coefficient, but only for the situation where the predicted categorical variable A is dichotomous. The present paper completes the previous work by developing an asymptotic test where the predicted category A is any polytomous variable.",,,"Suich, RC@Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Informat Syst Decis Sci, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA@No Arizona Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA::Turek, RJ@Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Informat Syst Decis Sci, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA@No Arizona Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Suich, RC@California State University System@California State University Fullerton@Northern Arizona University::Turek, RJ@California State University System@California State University Fullerton@Northern Arizona University",not exist,"MEASURES OF ASSOCIATION FOR CROSS CLASSIFICATIONS .4.

Evaluation of global testing procedures for item fit to the Rasch model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003321645395,MAY 2003,38,18,"Two types of global testing procedures for item fit to the Rasch model were evaluated using simulation studies. The first type incorporates three tests based on first-order statistics: van den Wollenberg's Q(1) test, Glas's R(1) test, and Andersen's LR test. The second type incorporates three tests based on second-order statistics: van den Wollenberg's Q(2) test, Glas's R(2) test, and a non-parametric test proposed by Ponocny. The Type I error rates and the power against the violation of parallel item response curves, unidimensionality and local independence were analysed in relation to sample size and test length. In general, the outcomes indicate a satisfactory performance of all tests, except the Q(2) test which exhibits an inflated Type I error rate. Further, it was found that both types of tests have power against all three types of model violation.

Bayesian model selection for mixtures of structural equation models with an unknown number of components,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003321645403,MAY 2003,58,27,"This paper considers mixtures of structural equation models with an unknown number of components. A Bayesian model selection approach is developed based on the Bayes factor. A procedure for computing the Bayes factor is developed via path sampling, which has a number of nice features. The key idea is to construct a continuous path linking the competing models; then the Bayes factor can be estimated efficiently via grids in [0, 1] and simulated observations that are generated by the Gibbs sampler from the posterior distribution. Bayesian estimates of the structural parameters, latent variables, as well as other statistics can be produced as by-products. The properties and merits of the proposed procedure are discussed and illustrated by means of a simulation study and a real example.",,"COVARIANCE-STRUCTURE MODELS,LATENT VARIABLE MODELS,FINITE MIXTURES,POLYTOMOUS DATA,MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD,DENSITY-ESTIMATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,APPROXIMATIONS,INFERENCE,MOMENTS","Lee, SY@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Zhongshan Univ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China::Song, XY@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Zhongshan Univ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Lee, SY@Chinese University of Hong Kong@Sun Yat Sen University::Song, XY@Chinese University of Hong Kong@Sun Yat Sen University",not exist,"STATISTICAL MODELING OF DATA ON TEACHING STYLES+AITKIN, M; ANDERSON, D; HINDE, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1981::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::Mixtures of conditional mean- and covariance-structure models+Arminger, G; Stein, P; Wittenberg, J+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1999::A Bayesian approach to nonlinear latent variable models using the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm+Arminger, G+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::Finite mixtures of covariance structure models with regressors - Loglikelihood function, minimum distance estimation, fit indices, and a complex example+Arminger, G; Stein, P+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+NOV 1997::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::no title+Box, GEP; Tiao, GC.+Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis+1992::no title+Broemeling, L.

Pairwise multiple comparisons: A model comparison approach versus stepwise procedures,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711003321645412,MAY 2003,32,14,"Researchers in the behavioural sciences have been presented with a host of pairwise multiple comparison procedures that attempt to obtain an optimal combination of Type I error control, power, and ease of application. However, these procedures share one important limitation: intransitive decisions. Moreover, they can be characterized as a piecemeal approach to the problem rather than a holistic approach. Dayton has recently proposed a new approach to pairwise multiple comparisons testing that eliminates intransitivity through a model selection procedure. The present study compared the model selection approach (and a protected version) with three powerful and easy-to-use stepwise multiple comparison procedures in terms of the proportion of times that the procedure identified the true pattern of differences among a set of means across several one-way layouts. The protected version of the model selection approach selected the true model a significantly greater proportion of times than the stepwise procedures and, in most cases, was not affected by variance heterogeneity and non-normality.",,"BONFERRONI PROCEDURE,TESTS","Cribbie, RA@York Univ, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada@Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada::Keselman, HJ@York Univ, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada@Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Cribbie, RA@York University - Canada@University of Manitoba::Keselman, HJ@York University - Canada@University of Manitoba","Rohlf, F@A-8710-2008","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Teoria statistica delle classi e calcolo delle probabilita+Bonferroni, C.

In this paper, a simple measure of individual performance on the task that gives equal credit for near misses and correct responses is presented, and an exact small-sample test of significance for the measure is developed using rook methodology.

The case of standardized observed variables is dealt with as a typical example with restrictions on parameters.

A tandem random walk model of the SAT paradigm: Response times and accumulation of evidence,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002760554589,NOV 2002,39,5,"The speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) paradigm forces participants to trade response speed for information accuracy by presenting them with a response signal at variable times after the onset of processing to which they must give an immediate response (within 300 ms). The processes that underlie the paradigm, especially those affecting response times, are not completely understood. Also, the extent to which the paradigm might affect the evidence accumulation process is still unclear. By testing several different sets of assumptions, we present a random walk model for the SAT paradigm that qualitatively explains both accuracy and response time data. The model uses a tandem random walk, with two possible continuations in a second phase which begins after the response signal. If a boundary is not reached during phase one, the walk transfers the current sum (relative to the size of the boundaries) from phase one to phase two in the form of bias, with drift rate equal to zero. If, however, a boundary is reached in phase one, the second phase starts from zero (no bias) with a strong drift rate towards the previously reached boundary. The model also incorporates a psychological refractory period: a delay in the onset of a second task when two tasks are presented in close succession. The model is consistent with the idea that information about the evidence accumulation rate is not contaminated by the paradigm.",,"SPEED-ACCURACY,RECOGNITION MEMORY,MENTAL PROCESSES,DECISION-MODEL,INFORMATION,RETRIEVAL,DYNAMICS,DISCRIMINATION,INTERFERENCE,COGNITION","Nikolic, D@Max Planck Inst Brain Res, Dept Neurophysiol, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany@Univ Oklahoma, Dept Psychol, Norman, OK 73019 USA::Gronlund, SD@Max Planck Inst Brain Res, Dept Neurophysiol, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany@Univ Oklahoma, Dept Psychol, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Nikolic, D@Max Planck Society@University of Oklahoma - Norman@University of Oklahoma System::Gronlund, SD@Max Planck Society@University of Oklahoma - Norman@University of Oklahoma System","Nikolic, Danko@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9317-8494","no title+BUSEMEYER JR+SAT C 30 ANN MATH PS+1997::no title+CREAMER LR+J EXP PSYCHOL+1963::DISCRIMINATING PREEXPERIMENTAL (SEMANTIC) FROM LEARNED (EPISODIC) ASSOCIATIONS - A SPEED ACCURACY STUDY+DOSHER, BA+COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY+1984::THE EFFECTS OF DELAY AND INTERFERENCE - A SPEED-ACCURACY STUDY+DOSHER, BA+COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY+1981::DEGREE OF LEARNING AND RETRIEVAL SPEED - STUDY TIME AND MULTIPLE EXPOSURES+DOSHER, BA+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION+1984::TIME COURSE OF ITEM AND ASSOCIATIVE INFORMATION - IMPLICATIONS FOR GLOBAL MEMORY MODELS+GRONLUND, SD; RATCLIFF, R+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION+SEP 1989::ANALYSIS OF THE HOCKLEY AND MURDOCK DECISION-MODEL+GRONLUND, SD; RATCLIFF, R+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+SEP 1991::no title+GRONLUND SD+MIN C MEM MOD EV IL+1988::A TANDEM RANDOM-WALK MODEL FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCRIMINATION+HEATH, RA+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1981::A GENERAL NONSTATIONARY DIFFUSION-MODEL FOR 2-CHOICE DECISION-MAKING+HEATH, RA+MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES+JUN 1992::Retrieval dynamics in recognition and list discrimination: Further evidence of separate processes of familiarity and recall+Hintzman, DL; Caulton, DA; Levitin, DJ+MEMORY &amp; COGNITION+MAY 1998::A DECISION-MODEL FOR ACCURACY AND RESPONSE LATENCY IN RECOGNITION MEMORY+HOCKLEY, WE; MURDOCK, BB+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+JUL 1987::no title+Kucera, H.; Francis, W.+Computational Analysis of Present Day American English+1967::no title+LAMING D+MATH PSYCHOL+1973::no title+Link, S.

A mixture model approach to indexing rater agreement,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002760554598,NOV 2002,26,14,"Raters are an important potential source of measurement error when assigning targets to categories. Therefore, psychologists have devoted considerable attention to quantifying the extent to which ratings agree with each other. Two main approaches to analysing rater agreement data can be distinguished. While the first approach focuses on the development of summary statistics that index rater agreement, the second models the association pattern among the observers' ratings. With the modelling approach three groups of models can be distinguished: latent class models, simple quasi-symmetric agreement models, and mixture models. This paper discusses a class of mixture models that is defined by its characteristic of having a quasi-symmetric log-linear representation. This class of models has two interesting properties. First, the simple quasi-symmetric agreement models can be shown to be members of this class. Therefore, the results of a rater agreement analysis based on a simple quasi-symmetric agreement model may be interpreted in the mixture model framework. Second, since the mixture models readily provide a familiar measure of rater reliability, it is possible to obtain a model-based estimate of rater reliability from the simple quasi-symmetric agreement models. The suggested class of mixture models will be illustrated using data from a persuasive communication study in which three raters classified respondents on the basis of their elicited cognitive responses.",,"LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS,INTERRATER AGREEMENT,KAPPA,ASSOCIATION,FIT","Schuster, C@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Schuster, C@University of Notre Dame",not exist,"A MODEL FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN RATINGS ON AN ORDINAL SCALE+AGRESTI, A+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1988::Modelling patterns of agreement and disagreement.+Agresti, A+Statistical methods in medical research+1992::AN AGREEMENT MODEL WITH KAPPA AS PARAMETER+AGRESTI, A+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 1989::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION OF AGREEMENT IN THE CONSTANT PREDICTIVE PROBABILITY MODEL, AND ITS RELATION TO COHEN KAPPA+AICKIN, M+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1990::Beyond kappa: A review of interrater agreement measures+Banerjee, M+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1999::USING ASSOCIATION MODELS TO ANALYZE AGREEMENT DATA - 2 EXAMPLES+BECKER, MP+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+OCT 1989::no title+Becker, RA; Chambers, JM; Wilks, AR.+The new S language: a programming environment for data analysis and graphics+1988::Category distinguishability and observer agreement+Darroch, J.N.; McCloud, P.I.+Australian Journal of Statistics+1986::A PROBABILISTIC LATENT CLASS MODEL FOR ASSESSING INTER-JUDGE RELIABILITY+DILLON, WR; MULANI, N+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1984::LINEAR LOGISTIC LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS FOR POLYTOMOUS DATA+FORMANN, AK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::Rater agreement and the generalized Rudas-Clogg-Lindsay index of fit+Formann, AK+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 30 2000::SIMPLE-MODELS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF ASSOCIATION IN CROSS-CLASSIFICATIONS HAVING ORDERED CATEGORIES+GOODMAN, LA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::THE ANALYSIS OF ORDINAL AGREEMENT DATA - BEYOND WEIGHTED KAPPA+GRAHAM, P; JACKSON, R+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY+SEP 1993::Kappa-like indices of observer agreement viewed from a latent class perspective+Guggenmoos-Holzmann, I; Vonk, R+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 30 1998::HOW RELIABLE ARE CHANCE-CORRECTED MEASURES OF AGREEMENT+GUGGENMOOSHOLZMANN, I+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 15 1993::no title+Holland, P; Bishop, Y.; Fienberg, S.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis: Theory and Practice.+1975::COEFFICIENTS OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN OBSERVERS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION+MAXWELL, AE+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY+1977::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.

The comparative sensitivity of ordinal multiple regression and least squares regression to departures from interval scaling,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002760554606,NOV 2002,11,1,"The comparative sensitivity of ordinal multiple regression (OMR) and least squares regression (LSR) to criterion variable deviations from interval scaling was investigated byway of computer simulation. LSR on raw scores and ranks was compared to OMR on raw scores, ranks and dominances. Simulated data sets varied on predictor variable correlations, amount of prediction error, weight distinctiveness and shape of rating-scale distribution. The results indicated that LSR on raw scores was most affected by discretization in all conditions. In contrast, the performance of LSR approximated that of OMR when the data were first transformed to ranks. The poor performance of LSR on raw scores was most pronounced when the data discretization resulted in a symmetrical distribution. Predictor variable correlations and amount of prediction error did not affect the pattern of results. Weight distinctiveness did not interact with the other factors.",,"STATISTICS,QUESTIONS","Woodward, TS@Univ Victoria, Dept Psychol, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada::Hunter, MA@Univ Victoria, Dept Psychol, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada::Kadlec, H@Univ Victoria, Dept Psychol, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada","Woodward, TS@University of Victoria::Hunter, MA@University of Victoria::Kadlec, H@University of Victoria","Woodward, Todd@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8083-0079","no title+CLIFF N+BEST METHODS ANAL CH+1991::PREDICTING ORDINAL RELATIONS+CLIFF, N+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1994::Answering ordinal questions with ordinal data using ordinal statistics+Cliff, N+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1996::no title+Cliff, N.+Ordinal Methods for Behavioral Data Analysis+1996::DOMINANCE STATISTICS - ORDINAL ANALYSES TO ANSWER ORDINAL QUESTIONS+CLIFF, N+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+NOV 1993::ORDINAL TEST FIDELITY ESTIMATED BY AN ITEM SAMPLING MODEL+CLIFF, N; DONOGHUE, JR+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 1992::ORDINAL CONSISTENCY AND ORDINAL TRUE SCORES+CLIFF, N+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 1989::no title+JORESKOG KG+PRESLIS USERS GUIDE+1988::no title+Kendall, M.G.; Gibbons, J.D.+Rank correlation methods+1990::A confidence interval for ordinal multiple regression weights+Long, JD+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 1999::ESTIMATING COEFFICIENTS IN LINEAR-MODELS - IT DO NOT MAKE NO NEVERMIND+WAINER, H+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1976"
High-breakdown estimation of multivariate mean and covariance with missing observations,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002760554615,NOV 2002,42,19,"We consider the problem of outliers in incomplete multivariate data when the aim is to estimate a measure of mean and covariance, as is the case, for example, in factor analysis. The ER algorithm of Little and Smith which combines the EM algorithm for missing data and a robust estimation step based on an M-estimator could be used in such a situation. However, the ER algorithm as originally proposed can fail to be robust in some cases, especially in high dimensions. We propose here two alternatives to avoid the problem. One is to combine a small modification of the ER algorithm with a so-called high-breakdown estimator as the starting point for the iterative procedure, and the other is to base the estimation step of the ER algorithm on a high-breakdown estimator. Among the high-breakdown estimators which are actually built to keep their robustness properties even if the number of variables is relatively large, we consider here the minimum covariance determinant estimator and the t-biweight S-estimator. Simulated and real data are used to compare and illustrate the different procedures.",,"ROBUST ESTIMATION,DETERMINANT ESTIMATOR,HIGH DIMENSION,LOCATION,SCATTER,ALGORITHM,MATRICES,OUTLIERS,POINTS,SHAPE","Cheng, TC@Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Educ, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland@Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Stat, Taipei, Taiwan::Victoria-Feser, MP@Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Educ, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland@Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Stat, Taipei, Taiwan","Cheng, TC@University of Geneva@National Chengchi University::Victoria-Feser, MP@University of Geneva@National Chengchi University",not exist,"no title+ATKINSON AC+22 BIENN C SOC MULT+2000::FAST VERY ROBUST METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF MULTIPLE OUTLIERS+ATKINSON, AC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1994::no title+Baddeley, A.

Techniques for oblique factor rotation of two or more loading matrices to a mixture of simple structure and optimal agreement,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002760554624,NOV 2002,31,7,"Three techniques are proposed for oblique rotation of two or more loading matrices to a mixture of simple structure and optimal agreement. The three techniques, consensus direct oblimin, consensus promin and consensus simple target rotation, are compared to existing techniques and to each other, using artificial and real data. When agreement between solutions can be expected, the new techniques appear to be more useful than oblique rotation of each of the loading matrices separately. Consensus direct oblimin achieved the best results in terms of 'agreement between simple structures'; consensus promin was the technique that best recovered the underlying simple loading matrix; and consensus simple target rotation seemed to give an interesting compromise between agreement and simple structure, focusing a little more on simplicity than consensus direct oblimin.",,"VALIDATION,SCALE","Lorenzo-Seva, U@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Psychol, Tarragona 43007, Spain@Univ Groningen, Dept Psychol, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands::Kiers, HAL@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Psychol, Tarragona 43007, Spain@Univ Groningen, Dept Psychol, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands::ten Berge, JMF@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Psychol, Tarragona 43007, Spain@Univ Groningen, Dept Psychol, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands","Lorenzo-Seva, U@Universitat Rovira i Virgili@University of Groningen::Kiers, HAL@Universitat Rovira i Virgili@University of Groningen::ten Berge, JMF@Universitat Rovira i Virgili@University of Groningen","Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@G-4228-2011::Kiers, Henk@D-2900-2012::lorenzo-seva, Urbano@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5369-3099","FACTOR SIMPLICITY INDEX AND TRANSFORMATIONS+BENTLER, PM+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1977::FACTORIAL ROTATION TO SIMPLE STRUCTURE AND MAXIMUM SIMILARITY+BLOXOM, B+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1968::OBLIQUE ROTATION TO A PARTIALLY SPECIFIED TARGET+BROWNE, MW+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1972::QUARTIC ROTATION CRITERIA AND ALGORITHMS+CLARKSON, DB; JENNRICH, RI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 1988::WEIGHTED VARIMAX ROTATION AND PROMAX ROTATION+CURETON, EE; MULAIK, SA+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1975::TRANSFORMATION OF FACTOR MATRICES TO ACHIEVE CONGRUENCE+EVANS, GT+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1971::no title+Eysenck, H.

Significance-testing the validity of idiographic methods: A little derangement goes a long way,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002760554525,NOV 2002,10,3,"We present an experimental design for validating idiographic data and the mathematical basis for subjecting this to statistical hypothesis testing. The method involves matching descriptions of four or more objects to the people from which they arose. If four or more can be matched, this is unlikely (p < 0.05) to have arisen by chance alone and the null hypothesis that the data communicate no information can be rejected. This criterion score of 4 is sufficient for statistical significance regardless of the total number of objects on which matching was attempted. The mathematics of this somewhat counterintuitive result is given, and we argue that this method is of value in validating idiographic data.

This sparseness invalidates the usual approximation to the distribution of the chi-squared or log-likelihood tests of goodness of fit. We present a solution to this problem by proposing a test based on a comparison of the observed and expected frequencies of the second-order margins of the table. A X 2 approximation to the sampling distribution is provided using asymptotic moments. This can be straightforwardly calculated from the expected cell frequencies. The new test is applied to several previously published examples relating to the fitting of latent variable models, but its application is quite general.",,"OF-FIT,MODELS","Bartholomew, DJ@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England@Univ Macau, Fac Educ, Macao, Macao::Leung, SO@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England@Univ Macau, Fac Educ, Macao, Macao","Bartholomew, DJ@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University of Macau::Leung, SO@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London@University of Macau",not exist,"no title+ALBANESE MT+CIENCIA CULTURA+1991::Scaling unobservable constructs in social science+Bartholomew, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1998::no title+Bartholomew, DJ; Knott, M.+Latent variable models and factor analysis+1999::The goodness of fit of latent trait models in attitude measurement+Bartholomew, DJ; Tzamourani, P+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1999::FACTOR-ANALYSIS OF DICHOTOMIZED VARIABLES+CHRISTOFFERSSON, A+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1975::GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTING FOR LATENT CLASS MODELS+COLLINS, LM; FIDLER, PL; WUGALTER, SE; et al.+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1993::New developments in latent structure analysis applied to social attitudes+deMenezes, LM; Bartholomew, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1996::Bootstrapping goodness-of-fit measures in categorical data analysis+Langeheine, R; Pannekoek, J; VandePol, F+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1996::no title+PRESS WH+NUMERICAL RECIPES+1988::Analysis of residuals for the multinomial item response model+Reiser, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1996::A goodness-of-fit test for the latent class model when expected frequencies are small+reiser, M.; lin, Y.+Sociological Methodology2+1999::RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERSONAL HEALTH - A HISTORICAL-PERSPECTIVE+REISER, SJ+JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND PHILOSOPHY+1985::no title+VANDERHEIJDEN P+APPL LATENT TRAIT LA+1997"
An inhibition-based stochastic countable-time decision model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002159671,MAY 2002,11,0,"A new stochastic model to account for reaction-time fluctuation in prolonged work tasks is presented. Transition probabilities from work periods to distraction periods and vice versa are dependent on inhibition, which increases during work and decreases during distractions. The model presented here differs from ail other inhibition-based models in that transitions can take place only at certain random points in time, and is referred to as a countable-time decision model. It is argued that the proposed model is a more plausible alternative to other existing inhibition-based models, while at the same time being highly flexible in that it is able to approximate other models arbitrarily well.

Controlling the rate of Type I error over a large set of statistical tests,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002159680,MAY 2002,33,88,"When many tests of significance are examined in a research investigation with procedures that limit the probability of making at least one Type I error-the so-called familywise techniques of control-the likelihood of detecting effects can be very low. That is, when familywise error controlling methods are adopted to assess statistical significance, the size of the critical value that must be exceeded in order to obtain statistical significance can be extremely large when the number of tests to be examined is also very large. In our investigation we examined three methods for increasing the sensitivity to detect effects when family size is large: the false discovery rate of error control presented by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), a modified false discovery rate presented by Benjamini and Hochberg (2000) which estimates the number of true null hypotheses prior to adopting false discovery rate control, and a familywise method modified to control the probability of committing two or more Type I errors in the family of tests examined-not one, as is the case with the usual familywise techniques. Our results indicated that the level of significance for the two or more familywise method of Type I error control varied with the testing scenario and needed to be set on occasion at values in excess of 0.15 in order to control the two or more rate at a reasonable value of 0.01. In addition, the false discovery rate methods typically resulted in substantially greater power to detect non-null effects even though their levels of significance were set at the standard 0.05 value. Accordingly, we recommend the Benjamini! and Hochberg (1995, 2000) methods of Type I error control when the number of tests in the family is large.",,"FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,MULTIPLE COMPARISONS","Keselman, HJ@Univ Manitoba, Dept Psychol, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA::Cribbie, R@Univ Manitoba, Dept Psychol, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA::Holland, B@Univ Manitoba, Dept Psychol, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Keselman, HJ@University of Manitoba@Temple University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)::Cribbie, R@University of Manitoba@Temple University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)::Holland, B@University of Manitoba@Temple University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)",not exist,"no title+BARTON RM+ANN M AM ED RES ASS+1989::no title+BENJAMINI Y+ANN STAT+2001::On the adaptive control of the false discovery fate in multiple testing with independent statistics+Benjamini, Y; Hochberg, Y+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SPR 2000::A step-down multiple hypotheses testing procedure that controls the false discovery rate under independence+Benjamini, Y; Liu, W+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 1 1999::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::no title+BENJAMINI Y+UNPUB FALSE DISCOVER+1994::False discoveries in genome scanning+Drigalenko, EI; Elston, RC+GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY+1997::STUDY OF POWERS OF SEVERAL METHODS OF MULTIPLE COMPARISONS+EINOT, I; GABRIEL, KR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1975::SOME IMPLICATIONS OF AN ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION OF THE MULTIPLE COMPARISON PROBLEM+HALPERIN, M; LAN, KKG; HAMDY, MI+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1988::A SHARPER BONFERRONI PROCEDURE FOR MULTIPLE TESTS OF SIGNIFICANCE+HOCHBERG, Y+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1988::MORE POWERFUL PROCEDURES FOR MULTIPLE SIGNIFICANCE TESTING+HOCHBERG, Y; BENJAMINI, Y+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 1990::no title+HOLLAND B+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+2002::A STAGEWISE REJECTIVE MULTIPLE TEST PROCEDURE BASED ON A MODIFIED BONFERRONI TEST+HOMMEL, G+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1988::SAMPLE AND POPULATION SCORE MATRICES AND SAMPLE CORRELATION-MATRICES FROM AN ARBITRARY POPULATION CORRELATION MATRIX+KAISER, HF; DICKMAN, K+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1962::The pairwise multiple comparison multiplicity problem: An alternative approach to familywise and comparisonwise type I error control+Keselman, HJ; Cribbie, R; Holland, B+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 1999::Statistical practices of educational researchers: An analysis of their ANOVA, MANOVA, and ANCOVA analyses+Keselman, HJ; Huberty, CJ; Lix, LM; et al.+REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH+FAL 1998::JOB INVOLVEMENT - AN ELUSIVE CONCEPT+KNOOP, R+PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS+OCT 1986::Functional connectivity in depressive, obsessive-compulsive, and schizophrenic disorders: an explorative correlational analysis of regional cerebral metabolism+Mallet, L; Mazoyer, B; Martinot, JL+PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH-NEUROIMAGING+MAY 20 1998::no title+MILLER RG+SIMULTANEOUS STAT IN+1981::Multiple testing and statistical power with modified Bonferroni procedures+Olejnik, S; Li, JM; Supattathum, S; et al.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+WIN 1997::A SEQUENTIALLY REJECTIVE TEST PROCEDURE BASED ON A MODIFIED BONFERRONI INEQUALITY+ROM, DM+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1990::No adjustments are needed for multiple comparisons.+Rothman, K J+Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)+1990-Jan::Some probability inequalities for ordered MTP2 random variables: A proof of the Simes conjecture+Sarkar, SK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1998::The Simes method for multiple hypothesis testing with positively dependent test statistics+Sarkar, SK; Chang, CK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::no title+no author+SAS/STAT&amp;REG; User's Guide: version 8. 1+1999::no title+*SAS I+SAS IML SOFTW US REF+1989::MULTIPLE COMPARISON PROCEDURES - THE PRACTICAL SOLUTION+SAVILLE, DJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1990::PSYCHOMETRIC EVALUATION OF AN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE+SCHIPPMANN, JS; PRIEN, EP+PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS+AUG 1986::MULTIPLE HYPOTHESIS-TESTING+SHAFFER, JP+ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY+1995::no title+no author+Multiple comparisons and multiple tests using the SAS system+1999::Controlling error in multiple comparisons, with examples from state-to-state differences in educational achievement+Williams, VSL; Jones, LV; Tukey, JW+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SPR 1999::A NOTE ON THE INCONSISTENCY INHERENT IN THE NECESSITY TO PERFORM MULTIPLE COMPARISONS+WILSON, W+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1962::Resampling-based false discovery rate controlling multiple test procedures for correlated test statistics+Yekutieli, D; Benjamini, Y+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 1 1999"
Fitting structural equation models using estimating equations: A model segregation approach,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002159699,MAY 2002,43,7,"Problems such as improper solution, non-convergence, subsets of variables having different distribution, and latent variables with single indicators are common in the practice of structural equation modelling. In such cases, it may be feasible to fix some model parameters at prespecified values while concentrating on estimating some other parameters. This paper formulates such a model fitting process through a model segregation approach. The statistical properties of this procedure are studied using the theory of estimating equations and optimal estimating functions. The dependency of the new parameter estimates on those of the prespecified parameter estimates is characterized for several commonly used estimating equations. A rescaled model fit statistic is proposed.

Outcomes and sample selection: The case of a homelessness and substance abuse intervention,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002159707,MAY 2002,64,17,"In the likely event that some clients refuse to participate in a psychosocial field experiment, the estimates of the effects of the experimental treatment on client outcomes may suffer from sample selection bias, regardless of whether the statistical analyses include control variables. This paper explores ways of correcting for this bias with advanced correction strategies, focusing on experiments in which clients refuse assignment into treatment conditions. The sample selection modelling strategy, which is highly recommended but seldom applied to random sample psychosocial experiments, and some alternatives are discussed. Data from an experiment on homelessness and substance abuse are used to compare sample selection, conventional control variable, instrumental variable, and propensity score matching correction strategies. The empirical findings suggest that the sample selection modelling strategy provides reliable estimates of the effects of treatment, that it and some other correction strategies are awkward to apply when there is post-assignment rejection, and that the varying correction strategies provide widely divergent estimates. In light of these findings, researchers might wish regularly to compare estimates across multiple correction strategies.",,"TREATMENT PROGRAM,DRUG-ABUSE,BIAS,MODELS,PREDICTORS,ATTRITION,VARIABLES,ESTIMATOR,DROPOUT","Sosin, MR@Univ Chicago, Sch Social Serv Adm, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Sosin, MR@University of Chicago",not exist,"no title+ABEL MH+J MENT HEALTH ADMIN+1993::DROPPING OUT OF TREATMENT - CRITICAL REVIEW+BAEKELAND, F; LUNDWALL, L+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1975::no title+Bahr, H.

Sampling variability of the success ratio in predictor-based selection,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,NO DOI,MAY 2002,23,0,"In applied settings, the expected benefits of a predictor-based selection are often expressed in terms of the expected success ratio of the selection. Although Taylor and Russell proposed a formula to estimate its value, simple simulations show that their formula is often inadequate. Also, little is known at present about the sampling variability of the success ratio and, hence, about the accuracy with which the success ratio of any particular selection can be predicted. The above deficiencies are addressed for the three most popular single-stage selection scenarios: the restricted (or fixed) quota, the threshold (mastery or fixed cut-off) and the mixed quota/threshold decision. For each scenario it is shown how the sampling distribution of the success rate statistic can be derived. The problems related to the numerical evaluation of the distribution are also discussed, and it is shown by means of example applications that the sampling variability of the success ratio may be quite substantial in many real-world predictor-based selections.",,"PERSONNEL-SELECTION,UTILITY ANALYSIS,RISK","De Corte, W@State Univ Ghent, Fac Psychol, Dept Data Anal, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","De Corte, W@Ghent University",not exist,"ESTIMATING THE STANDARD ERROR OF PROJECTED DOLLAR GAINS IN UTILITY ANALYSIS+ALEXANDER, RA; BARRICK, MR+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+AUG 1987::THE GUIDE TO AVAILABLE MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE PROBLEM CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM+BOISVERT, RF; HOWE, SE; KAHANER, DK+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1991::Utility analysis for decisions in human resource management+Boudreau, J.W.+HDB IND ORG PSYCHOL+1991::On the interpretation of the correlation coefficient as a measure of predictive efficiency.+BROGDEN, H E+Journal of educational psychology+1946-Feb::no title+Cascio, W.+Applied psychology in human resources management+1998::RESPONDING TO THE DEMAND FOR ACCOUNTABILITY - CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF 3 UTILITY-MODELS+CASCIO, WF+ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE+1980::no title+Cronbach, L.

Measuring change in controlled longitudinal studies,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002159725,MAY 2002,25,9,"This paper examines the implications of the correlational structure of repeated measurements for three indices of change that can be used to evaluate treatment effects in longitudinal studies with scheduled assessment times and fixed total duration. The generalized least squares (GLS) regression of repeated measurements on time, which is usually reserved for complex mixed model solutions, takes the correlational structure of the repeated measurements into account, whereas simple gain scores and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression calculations do not. Nevertheless, the GLS solution is equivalent to OLS under conditions of compound symmetry and is equivalent to the analysis of simple gain scores in the presence of an autoregressive (order 1) correlational structure. The understanding of these relationships is important with regard to the frequently heard criticisms of the simpler definitions of treatment response in repeated measurement designs.",,SERIAL-CORRELATION,"Overall, JE@Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Houston, TX USA::Tonidandel, S@Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Houston, TX USA","Overall, JE@University of Texas System@University of Texas Health Science Center Houston::Tonidandel, S@University of Texas System@University of Texas Health Science Center Houston",not exist,"no title+AHN C+IN PRESS J BIOPHARMA+2000::no title+CHI EM+J AM STAT ASSOC+1989::HOW WE SHOULD MEASURE CHANGE - OR SHOULD WE+CRONBACH, LJ+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1970::AN APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF REPEATED MEASUREMENTS+DIGGLE, PJ+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1988::no title+Giltinan, D.

Cross-validation by downweighting influential cases in structural equation modelling,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002159734,MAY 2002,62,10,"In the social and behavioural sciences, structural equation modelling has been widely used to test a substantive theory or causal relationship among latent constructs. Cross-validation (CV) is a valuable tool for selecting the best model among competing structural models. Influential cases or outliers are often present in practical data. Therefore, even the correct model for the majority of the data may not cross-validate well. This paper discusses various drawbacks of CV based on sample covariance matrices, and develops a procedure for using robust covariance matrices in the model calibration and validation stages. Examples illustrate that the CV index based on sample covariance matrices is very sensitive to influential cases, and even a single outlier can cause the CV index to support a wrong model. The CV index based on robust covariance matrices is much less sensitive to influential cases and thus leads to a more valid conclusion about the practical value of a model structure.",,"COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS,ROBUST ESTIMATION,MULTIVARIATE SKEWNESS,PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,LEAST-SQUARES,MATRICES,ESTIMATORS,KURTOSIS,LOCATION","Yuan, KH@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA::Marshall, LL@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA::Weston, R@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA","Yuan, KH@University of Notre Dame@University of North Texas Denton@University of North Texas System::Marshall, LL@University of Notre Dame@University of North Texas Denton@University of North Texas System::Weston, R@University of Notre Dame@University of North Texas Denton@University of North Texas System",not exist,"FACTOR-ANALYSIS AND AIC+AKAIKE, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::Information theory and the maximum likelihood principle+AKAIKE, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::ROBUST PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS+AMMANN, LP+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1989::STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING IN PRACTICE - A REVIEW AND RECOMMENDED 2-STEP APPROACH+ANDERSON, JC; GERBING, DW+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+MAY 1988::FACTORS INFLUENCING CROSS-VALIDATION OF CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS MODELS+BANDALOS, DL+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1993::no title+Barnett, V.; Lewis, T.; Abeles, Francine.+Outliers in statistical data+1994::no title+Bentler, P.

Examining group differences in reliability of multiple-component instruments,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002159743,MAY 2002,31,12,"A covariance structure modelling method for examining group differences in scale reliability of multi-component measuring instruments is proposed. The procedure is based on a set of appropriate parameter constraints imposed in a multiple-population structural model. Unlike tests of group differences in coefficient alpha that in general do not evaluate the discrepancies in scale reliability coefficients, the described approach permits one to examine differences in the latter quantities of actual interest when concerned with questions pertaining to reliability of composite scores. The method can be used to test whether a given measuring instrument has identical reliabilities in studied populations, and/or whether distinct instruments, or modes of administration of the same instrument, have equal reliabilities across groups.

Methods for comparing alternative measures of dispersion have been derived that perform well in simulations, but all methods for comparing variances have been found to be unsatisfactory in terms of Type I error probabilities or power Currently, it appears that the most successful method, in terms of controlling the probability of a Type I error is based on the so-called mean half-square successive difference statistic where a bootstrap is used to estimate its standard error, and a calibrated boot-strap is used to control the probability of a Type I error, But the mean half-square successive difference statistic is not permutation-invariant, and it is fairly evident that power can be relatively poor A slight modification of the percentile bootstrap method for computing a 1 - alpha confidence interval for the difference between the variances is considered that corrects these problems.",,"NONIDENTICAL SHAPES,ROBUST-TESTS,MONTE-CARLO,DISTRIBUTIONS,BOOTSTRAP,EQUALITY","Wilcox, RR@Univ So Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Wilcox, RR@University of Southern California","Wilcox, Rand@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2524-2976","Monte Carlo approximation of bootstrap variances+Booth, JG; Sarkar, S+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1998::NON-NORMALITY AND TESTS ON VARIANCES+BOX, GEP+BIOMETRIKA+1953::Robust tests for the Equality of Variances+BROWN, M.

Influential observations in the estimation of mean vector and covariance matrix,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711002159644,MAY 2002,24,16,"Statistical procedures designed for analysing multivariate data sets often emphasize different sample statistics. While some procedures emphasize the estimates of both the mean vector mu and the covariance matrix Sigma, others may emphasize only one of these two sample quantities. In effect, while an unusual observation in a data set has a deleterious impact on the results from an analysis that depends heavily on the covariance matrix, its effect when dependence is on the mean vector may be minimal. The aim of this paper is to develop diagnostic measures for identifying influential observations of different kinds. Three diagnostic measures, based on the local influence approach, are constructed to identify observations that exercise undue influence on the estimate of mu, of Sigma, and of both together. Real data sets are analysed and results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed measures.",,"LOCAL INFLUENCE,MULTIVARIATE OUTLIERS,MULTIPLE OUTLIERS,LINEAR-REGRESSION,LEVERAGE POINTS,DIAGNOSTICS","Poon, WY@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA::Poon, YS@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Poon, WY@Chinese University of Hong Kong@University of California System@University of California Riverside::Poon, YS@Chinese University of Hong Kong@University of California System@University of California Riverside",not exist,"no title+Anderson, T.

Criticality of predictors in multiple regression,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711001159483,NOV 2001,23,19,"A new method is proposed for comparing all predictors in a multiple regression model. This method generates a measure of predictor criticality, which is distinct from and has several advantages over traditional indices of predictor importance.

Using the bootstrapping (resampling with replacement) procedure, a large number of samples are obtained from a given data set which contains one response variable and p predictors. For each sample, all 2(p) - 1 subset regression models are fitted and the best subset model is selected. Thus, the (multinomial) distribution of the probability that each of the 2(p) - 1 subsets is 'the best' model for the data set is obtained.

A predictor's criticality is defined as a function of the probabilities associated with the models that include the predictor. That is, a predictor which is included in a large number of probable models is critical to the identification of the best-fitting regression model and, therefore, to the prediction of the response variable.

The procedure can be applied to fixed and random regression models and can use any measure of goodness of fit (e.g., adjusted R-2, C-p, AIC) for identifying the best model. Several criticality measures can be defined by using different combinations of the probabilities of the best-fitting models, and asymptotic confidence intervals for each variable's criticality can be derived. The procedure is illustrated with several examples.",,"RELATIVE IMPORTANCE,VARIABLES,SELECTION","Azen, R@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Educ Psychol, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA@Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel::Budescu, DV@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Educ Psychol, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA@Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel::Reiser, B@Univ Wisconsin, Dept Educ Psychol, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA@Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@Univ Haifa, Dept Stat, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel","Azen, R@University of Wisconsin Milwaukee@University of Wisconsin System@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Haifa::Budescu, DV@University of Wisconsin Milwaukee@University of Wisconsin System@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Haifa::Reiser, B@University of Wisconsin Milwaukee@University of Wisconsin System@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Haifa","Reiser, Benjamin@G-6591-2012::Reiser, Benjamin@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9797-9029","Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike,, H.+P 2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::DOMINANCE ANALYSIS - A NEW APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PREDICTORS IN MULTIPLE-REGRESSION+BUDESCU, DV+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+NOV 1993::ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLICATIVE COMBINATION RULES WHEN THE CAUSAL VARIABLES ARE MEASURED WITH ERROR+BUSEMEYER, JR; JONES, LE+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1983::LARGE-SAMPLE THEORY - PARAMETRIC CASE+CHERNOFF, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1956::no title+DRAPER NR+POBABLITY BAYESIAN S+1987::1977 RIETZ LECTURE - BOOTSTRAP METHODS - ANOTHER LOOK AT THE JACKKNIFE+EFRON, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::LARGE SAMPLE STANDARD ERRORS OF KAPPA AND WEIGHTED KAPPA+FLEISS, JL; COHEN, J; EVERITT, BS+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1969::no title+Fleiss, JL.+Statistical methods for rates and proportions+1973::BOOTSTRAPPING REGRESSION-MODELS+FREEDMAN, DA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::Misleading interaction and curvilinear terms+Ganzach, Y+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 1997::ANALYSIS AND SELECTION OF VARIABLES IN LINEAR-REGRESSION+HOCKING, RR+BIOMETRICS+1976::no title+Judge, G.

Bayesian estimation and test for factor analysis model with continuous and polytomous data in several populations,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711001159546,NOV 2001,47,48,"The main purpose of this paper is to develop a Bayesian approach for the multisample factor analysis model with continuous and polytomous variables. Joint Bayesian estimates of the thresholds, the factor scores and the structural parameters subjected to some simple constraints across groups are obtained simultaneously. The Gibbs sampler is used to produce the joint Bayesian estimates. It is shown that the conditional distributions involved in the implementation are the familiar uniform, gamma, normal, univariate truncated normal and Wishart distributions. The Bayes factor is introduced to test hypotheses involving constraints among the structural parameters of the factor analysis models across groups. Two procedures for computing the test statistics are developed, one based on the Schwarz criterion (or Bayesian information criterion), while the other computes the posterior densities and likelihood ratios by means of draws from the appropriate conditional distributions via the Gibbs sampler. The empirical performance of the proposed Bayesian procedure and its sensitivity to prior distributions are illustrated by some simulation results and two real-life examples.",,"STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,LATENT VARIABLE MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS,PREDICTION,INVARIANCE,SELECTION","Song, XY@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Lee, SY@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Song, XY@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Lee, SY@Chinese University of Hong Kong",not exist,"no title+AITKIN M+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+1991::A Bayesian approach to nonlinear latent variable models using the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm+Arminger, G+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::no title+Bentler, P.

Misspecifying latent class models by mixture binomials,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711001159564,NOV 2001,18,2,"Four scenarios of homogeneity/heterogeneity with respect to the performance of the subjects and the task difficulties are considered: first, the unconstrained latent class model providing for heterogeneity with respect to both; second, the mixture binomial assuming constant task difficulty within each mixing component, but different levels of performance of the subjects; third, the model of independence which is equivalent to the one-class latent class model allowing for different task difficulties but no variability of the subjects; and fourth, the binomial with success probability constant across tasks and subjects. It is shown that both over- and underdispersion may arise in latent class models of which the other three are special cases. As a consequence, the latent class model and the mixture binomial may generate nearly indistinguishable score distributions where overdispersion is present. So the score distribution is not always indicative of the lack of fit of the mixture binomial when in fact the latent class model is true. It may, therefore, be misleading to accept mixture binomials as well-fitting models without having additionally assessed the fit of latent class models. This, however, is often the case in empirical research. A long series of investigations on Piaget's water-level tasks serves as a good example.",,"WATER-LEVEL TASK,INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES,PERFORMANCE","Formann, AK@Univ Vienna, Inst Psychol, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","Formann, AK@University of Vienna",not exist,"no title+ERDFELDER E+STAT METHODS LONGITU+1990::Structural latent class models+Formann, AK; Kohlmann, T+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1998::A WARNING ON THE USE OF CHI-SQUARED STATISTICS WITH FREQUENCY TABLES WITH SMALL EXPECTED CELL COUNTS+HABERMAN, SJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1988::no title+Johnson, NL; Kotz, S.+Discrete distributions+1969::no title+Kanji, G.

A nonlinear congeneric model for continuous item responses,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711001159573,NOV 2001,51,2,"This paper presents a unidimensional item response model intended for personality and attitude items that use a continuous response format. The model's starting point is the linear congeneric model for item scores, but it takes into account the bounded nature of the item responses and assumes that their conditional distributions for a fixed trait level are truncated normal. This assumption leads to nonlinear item-trait regressions and considerably modifies some aspects of the linear model. The linear model is considered as an approximation to the modified version, and an interval is defined in which the approximation is satisfactory. Procedures for estimating the item and subject parameters are described. The applicability of the model is illustrated using real data.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,EM ALGORITHM,COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,SCALES,CATEGORIES,VARIABLES,ABILITY","Ferrando, PJ@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Fac Psicol, Tarragona 43007, Spain","Ferrando, PJ@Universitat Rovira i Virgili","Ferrando, Pere@J-9857-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3133-5466","Feeling thermometers versus 7-point scales - Which are better?+Alwin, DF+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+FEB 1997::TOBIT MODELS - A SURVEY+AMEMIYA, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1984::no title+ANNER MA+TOOLS STAT INERENCE+1996::no title+Baker, F.+Item response theory: parameter estimation techniques+1992::no title+BARTOLOMEW DJ+LATENT VARIABLE MODE+1987::An application of the continuous response level model to personality measurement+Bejar, I.

Seriation of asymmetric matrices using integer linear programming,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711001159500,NOV 2001,27,9,"Integer linear programming approaches for seriation of asymmetric n x n proximity matrices have generally been perceived as intractable for problems of practical size. However, to date, no computational evidence has been provided regarding the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of such approaches. This paper presents an evaluation of an integer linear programming method for asymmetric seriation using five moderately sized matrices (15 less than or equal to n less than or equal to 36) from the psychological literature, as well as 80 synthetic matrices (20 less than or equal to n less than or equal to 30). The solution to the linear programming relaxation of the integer-programming model was integer-optimal for each of the five empirical matrices and many of the synthetic matrices. In such instances, branch-and-bound integer programming was not required and optimal orderings were obtained within a few seconds. In all cases where the solution to the linear programming relaxation was not integer-optimal, branch-and-bound integer programming was able to find an optimal seriation in 18 minutes or less. A pragmatic solution strategy for larger matrices (n > 30) is also presented. This approach exploits the fact that, in many instances, only a modest percentage of all possible transitivity constraints are required to obtain an optimal solution.",,PROXIMITY MATRICES,"Brusco, MJ@Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Mkt, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Brusco, MJ@State University System of Florida@Florida State University",not exist,"APPLICATIONS OF COMBINATORIAL PROGRAMMING TO DATA-ANALYSIS - SERIATION USING ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITY MEASURES+BAKER, FB; HUBERT, LJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1977::no title+BLIN MJ+MANAGE SCI+1974::FURTHER COMMENTS ON MAJORITY-RULE UNDER TRANSITIVITY CONSTRAINTS+BOWMAN, VJ; COLANTON.CS+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE SERIES A-THEORY+1974::MAJORITY RULE UNDER TRANSITIVITY CONSTRAINTS+BOWMAN, VJ; COLANTON.CS+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE SERIES A-THEORY+1973::no title+BRUSCO MJ+IN PRESS PSYCHOMETRI+2001::An Interactive multiobjective programming approach to combinatorial data analysis+Brusco, MJ; Stahl, S+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2001::BRANCH AND BOUND ALGORITHM FOR MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD PAIRED COMPARISON RANKING+DECANI, JS+BIOMETRIKA+1972::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD PAIRED COMPARISON RANKING BY LINEAR PROGRAMMING+DECANI, JS+BIOMETRIKA+1969::no title+DESOETE G+DATA ANAL INFORMATIC+1988::BRANCH SEARCH ALGORITHM FOR MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD PAIRED COMPARISON RANKING+FLUECK, JA; KORSH, JF+BIOMETRIKA+1974::The tunneling method for global optimization in multidimensional scaling+Groenen, PJF; Heiser, WJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1996::SELECTING A STIMULUS SET WITH PRESCRIBED STRUCTURE FROM EMPIRICAL CONFUSION FREQUENCIES+HEISER, WJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1988::THE ANALYSIS OF PROXIMITY MATRICES THROUGH SUMS OF MATRICES HAVING (ANTI-)ROBINSON FORMS+HUBERT, L; ARABIE, P+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1994::SERIATION USING ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITY MEASURES+HUBERT, L+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1976::no title+HUBERT L+COMBINATORIAL DATA A+2001::MATRIX REORGANIZATION AND DYNAMIC-PROGRAMMING - APPLICATIONS TO PAIRED COMPARISONS AND UNIDIMENSIONAL SERIATION+HUBERT, LJ; GOLLEDGE, RG+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1981::no title+ILOG INC+ILOG CPLEX 6 5+1999::A FURTHER PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING SLATER I AND ALL NEAREST ADJOINING ORDERS+PHILLIPS, JP+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1969::A PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING SLATERS I AND ALL NEAREST ADJOINING ORDERS+PHILLIPS, JP+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1967::ALGORITHM OF SMITH AND PAYNE FOR DETERMINING SLATERS I AND ALL NEAREST ADJOINING ORDERS+PHILLIPS, JPN+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1976::ALGORITHM FOR MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD RANKING AND SLATERS I FROM PAIRED COMPARISONS+RANYARD, RH+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1976::SERIATION AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL-SCALING - A DATA-ANALYSIS APPROACH TO SCALING ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITY MATRICES+RODGERS, JL; THOMPSON, TD+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUN 1992::A MEASURE OF STIMULUS SIMILARITY AND ERRORS IN SOME PAIRED-ASSOCIATE LEARNING-TASKS+ROTHKOPF, EZ+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY+1957::ALGORITHM FOR DETERMINING SLATERS I AND ALL NEAREST ADJOINING ORDERS+SMITH, AFM; PAYNE, CD+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1974::The method of paired comparisons for social values+Thurstone, L.

The linear mixed model and the hierarchical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model: Some equivalences and differences,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X498621,FEB 2011,32,7,"We focus on comparing different modelling approaches for intensive longitudinal designs. Two methods are scrutinized, namely the widely used linear mixed model (LMM) and the relatively unexplored Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process based state-space model. On the one hand, we show that given certain conditions they result in equivalent outcomes. On the other hand, we consider it important to emphasize that their perspectives are different and that one framework might better address certain types of research questions than the other. We show that, compared to a LMM, an OU process based approach can cope with modelling inter-individual differences in aspects that are more substantively interesting. However, the estimation of the LMM is faster and the model is more straightforward to implement. The models are illustrated through an experience sampling study.",,"LONGITUDINAL DATA,CORE AFFECT,BAYESIAN-APPROACH,EMOTION,EXPERIENCE,INFERENCE,ERRORS","Oravecz, Zita@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Tuerlinckx, Francis@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Oravecz, Zita@KU Leuven::Tuerlinckx, Francis@KU Leuven","Oravecz, Zita@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9070-3329","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::The experience of emotion+Barrett, Lisa Feldman; Mesquita, Batja; Ochsner, Kevin N.; et al.+ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY+2007::Bayesian inference for Markov processes with diffusion and discrete components+Blackwell, PG+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2003::Diary methods: Capturing life as it is lived+Bolger, N; Davis, A; Rafaeli, E+ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY+2003::no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the paths of moving animals+Brillinger, DR; Preisler, HK; Ager, AA; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAY 1 2004::VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE EXPERIENCE-SAMPLING METHOD+CSIKSZENTMIHALYI, M; LARSON, R+JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE+SEP 1987::A Bayesian approach for nonlinear regression models with continuous errors+de la Cruz-Mesia, R; Marshall, G+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2003::Non-linear random effects models with continuous time autoregressive errors: a Bayesian approach+De la Cruz-Mesia, R; Marshall, G+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 15 2006::no title+Diggle, P.

Instead of imposing many assumptions to arrive at a tractable statistical model, BRP simply seeks to accurately predict a response variable based on values of predictor variables. The method outputs a decision tree depicting the predictor variables that were related to the response variable, along with the nature of the variables' relationships. No significance tests are involved, and the tree's 'goodness' is judged based on its predictive accuracy. In this paper, we describe BRP methods in a detailed manner and illustrate their use in psychological research.

Bayesian analysis of mixtures in structural equation models with non-ignorable missing data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X475187,NOV 2010,20,7,"Structural equation models (SEMs) have become widely used to determine the interrelationships between latent and observed variables in social, psychological, and behavioural sciences. As heterogeneous data are very common in practical research in these fields, the analysis of mixture models has received a lot of attention in the literature. An important issue in the analysis of mixture SEMs is the presence of missing data, in particular of data missing with a non-ignorable mechanism. However, only a limited amount of work has been done in analysing mixture SEMs with non-ignorable missing data. The main objective of this paper is to develop a Bayesian approach for analysing mixture SEMs with an unknown number of components and non-ignorable missing data. A simulation study shows that Bayesian estimates obtained by the proposed Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are accurate and the Bayes factor computed via a path sampling procedure is useful for identifying the correct number of components, selecting an appropriate missingness mechanism, and investigating various effects of latent variables in the mixture SEMs. A real data set on a study of job satisfaction is used to demonstrate the methodology.",,"UNKNOWN NUMBER,COMPONENTS","Cai, Jing-Heng@Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Stat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China::Song, Xin-Yuan@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Cai, Jing-Heng@Sun Yat Sen University::Song, Xin-Yuan@Chinese University of Hong Kong",not exist,"Mixtures of conditional mean- and covariance-structure models+Arminger, G; Stein, P; Wittenberg, J+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1999::no title+BOLLEN KA+STRUCTURED EQUATIONS+1989::Fitting multivariage normal finite mixtures subject to structural equation modeling+Dolan, CV; Van der Maas, HLJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::no title+DUNSON IB+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+2000::Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation of classical and dynamic switching and mixture models+Fruhwirth-Schnatter, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Simulating normalizing constants: From importance sampling to bridge sampling to path sampling+Gelman, A; Meng, XL+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1998::STOCHASTIC RELAXATION, GIBBS DISTRIBUTIONS, AND THE BAYESIAN RESTORATION OF IMAGES+GEMAN, S; GEMAN, D+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+1984::MONTE-CARLO SAMPLING METHODS USING MARKOV CHAINS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+HASTINGS, WK+BIOMETRIKA+1970::Missing responses in generalised linear mixed models when the missing data mechanism is nonignorable+Ibrahim, JG; Chen, MH; Lipsitz, SR+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2001::BAYES FACTORS+KASS, RE; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::no title+Lee, S.Y.+Structural Equation Modeling: A Bayesian Approach+2007::Bayesian analysis of nonlinear structural equation models with nonignorable missing data+Lee, Sik-Yum; Tang, Nian-Sheng+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 2006::Bayesian model selection for mixtures of structural equation models with an unknown number of components+Lee, SY; Song, XY+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2003::no title+LEE SY+HDB LATENT VARIABLE+2007::no title+Li, Y.+Bayesian analysis of nonrecursive nonlinear structural equation models+2007::no title+Little, RJA; Rubin, DB.+Statistical Analysis with Missing Data+2002::EQUATION OF STATE CALCULATIONS BY FAST COMPUTING MACHINES+METROPOLIS, N; ROSENBLUTH, AW; ROSENBLUTH, MN; et al.+JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS+1953::On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components+Richardson, S; Green, PJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1997::Bayesian estimation and testing of structural equation models+Scheines, R; Hoijtink, H; Boomsma, A+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 1999::Dealing with label switching in mixture models+Stephens, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000"
Estimation of a four-parameter item response theory model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X474502,NOV 2010,28,19,"We explore the justification and formulation of a four-parameter item response theory model (4PM) and employ a Bayesian approach to recover successfully parameter estimates for items and respondents. For data generated using a 4PM item response model, overall fit is improved when using the 4PM rather than the 3PM or the 2PM. Furthermore, although estimated trait scores under the various models correlate almost perfectly, inferences at the high and low ends of the trait continuum are compromised, with poorer coverage of the confidence intervals when the wrong model is used. We also show in an empirical example that the 4PM can yield new insights into the properties of a widely used delinquency scale. We discuss the implications for building appropriate measurement models in education and psychology to model more accurately the underlying response process.",,"ABILITY,SCALE","Loken, Eric@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Rulison, Kelly L.@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Loken, Eric@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Rulison, Kelly L.@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::no title+no author+Item response theory: Parameter estimation techniques+2004::no title+Barton, M.

Detecting a lack of association: An equivalence testing approach,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X475853,NOV 2010,9,12,"Researchers often test for a lack of association between variables. A lack of association is usually established by demonstrating a non-significant relationship with a traditional test (e.g., Pearson's r). However, for logical as well as statistical reasons, such conclusions are problematic. In this paper, we discuss and compare the empirical Type I error and power rates of three lack of association tests. The results indicate that large, sometimes very large, sample sizes are required for the test statistics to be appropriate. What is especially problematic is that the required sample sizes may exceed what is practically feasible for the conditions that are expected to be common among researchers in psychology. This paper highlights the importance of using available lack of association tests, instead of traditional tests of association, for demonstrating the independence of variables, and qualifies the conditions under which these tests are appropriate.",,,"Goertzen, Jason R.@Unknow::Cribbie, Robert A.@York Univ, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","Goertzen, Jason R.@Unknow::Cribbie, Robert A.@York University - Canada",not exist,"Seeing the Fisher Z-transformation+Bond, CF; Richardson, K+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2004::A statistical test to show negligible trend+Dixon, PM; Pechmann, JHK+ECOLOGY+JUL 2005::Frequency distribution of the values of the correlation coefficient in samples from an indefinitely large population+Fisher, B.

Separating response-execution bias from decision bias: Arguments for an additional parameter in Ratcliff's diffusion model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X477581,NOV 2010,26,17,"Diffusion model data analysis permits the disentangling of different processes underlying the effects of experimental manipulations. Estimates can be provided for the speed of information accumulation, for the amount of information used to draw conclusions, and for a decision bias. One parameter describes the duration of non-decisional processes including the duration of motor-response execution. In the default diffusion model, it is implicitly assumed that both responses are executed with the same speed. In some applications of the diffusion model, this assumption will be violated. This will lead to biased parameter estimates. Consequently, we suggest accounting explicitly for differences in the speed of response execution for both responses. Results from a simulation study illustrate that parameter estimates from the default model are biased if the speed of response execution differs between responses. A second simulation study shows that large trial numbers (N > 1,000) are needed to detect whether differences in response-execution times are based on different execution times.",,"IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST,INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES,2-CHOICE DECISIONS,MEMORY RETRIEVAL,ACCURACY,TASKS,TIMES,EZ","Voss, Andreas@Univ Freiburg, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany::Voss, Jochen@Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England::Klauer, Karl Christoph@Univ Freiburg, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany","Voss, Andreas@University of Freiburg::Voss, Jochen@University of Leeds::Klauer, Karl Christoph@University of Freiburg","Voss, Jochen@F-9638-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2323-3814::Voss, Andreas@F-5087-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4499-3660","REPETITION EFFECTS WITH CATEGORIZABLE STIMULUS AND RESPONSE SETS+CAMPBELL, KC; PROCTOR, RW+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION+NOV 1993::Effect anticipation and action control+Elsner, B; Hommel, B+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE+FEB 2001::AN ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF RESPONSE COMPETITION+ERIKSEN, CW; COLES, MGH; MORRIS, LR; et al.+BULLETIN OF THE PSYCHONOMIC SOCIETY+1985::ON THE AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION OF ATTITUDES+FAZIO, RH; SANBONMATSU, DM; POWELL, MC; et al.+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 1986::On the mean and variance of response times under the diffusion model with an application to parameter estimation+Grasman, Raoul P.

A comparison of statistical selection strategies for univariate and bivariate log-linear models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X478580,NOV 2010,33,8,"In this study, eight statistical selection strategies were evaluated for selecting the parameterizations of log-linear models used to model the distributions of psychometric tests. The selection strategies included significance tests based on four chi-squared statistics (likelihood ratio, Pearson, Freeman-Tukey, and Cressie-Read) and four additional strategies (Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), consistent Akaike information criterion (CAIC), and a measure attributed to Goodman). The strategies were evaluated in simulations for different log-linear models of univariate and bivariate test-score distributions and two sample sizes. Results showed that all eight selection strategies were most accurate for the largest sample size considered. For univariate distributions, the AIC selection strategy was especially accurate for selecting the correct parameterization of a complex log-linear model and the likelihood ratio chi-squared selection strategy was the most accurate strategy for selecting the correct parameterization of a relatively simple log-linear model. For bivariate distributions, the likelihood ratio chi-squared, Freeman-Tukey chi-squared, BIC, and CAIC selection strategies had similarly high selection accuracies.",,"TEST SCORE DISTRIBUTIONS,INFORMATION CRITERION,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,LOGLINEAR MODELS,CLASSIFICATIONS","Moses, Tim@Educ Testing Serv, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA::Holland, Paul W.@Educ Testing Serv, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA","Moses, Tim@Educational Testing Service (ETS)::Holland, Paul W.@Educational Testing Service (ETS)","Holland, Peter@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1533-9376","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::LIKELIHOOD OF A MODEL AND INFORMATION CRITERIA+AKAIKE, H+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1981::Akaike's information criterion and recent developments in information complexity+Bozdogan, H+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAR 2000::MODEL SELECTION AND AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) - THE GENERAL-THEORY AND ITS ANALYTICAL EXTENSIONS+BOZDOGAN, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::Cross-validation methods+Browne, MW+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAR 2000::no title+CUI Z+NAT COUNC MEAS ED CH+2007::no title+DAYTON CM+J MODERN APPL STAT M+2003::no title+GILULA Z+ANN MATH STAT+1994::ANALYSIS OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTINGENCY TABLES - STEPWISE PROCEDURES AND DIRECT ESTIMATION METHODS FOR BUILDING MODELS FOR MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATIONS+GOODMAN, LA+TECHNOMETRICS+1971::Model selection based on minimum description length+Grunwald, P+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAR 2000::no title+Haberman, S.

Coping with stress through decisional control: Quantification of negotiating the environment,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X480640,NOV 2010,80,3,"Coping with stress through 'decisional control' - positioning oneself in a multifaceted stressing situation so as to minimize the likelihood of an untoward event is modelled within a tree-structure scenario, whose architecture hierarchically nests elements of varying threat. Analytic and simulation platforms quantify the game-like interplay of cognitive demands and threat reduction. When elements of uncertainty enter the theoretical structure, specifically at more subordinate levels of the hierarchy, the mathematical expectation of threat is particularly exacerbated. As quantified in this model, the exercise of decisional control is demonstrably related to reduction in expected threat (the minimum correlation across comprehensive parameter settings being .55). Disclosure of otherwise intractable stress-coping subtleties, endowed by the quantitative translation of verbal premises, is underscored. Formalization of decisional stress control is seen to usher in linkages to augmenting formal developments from fields of cognitive science, preference and choice modelling, and nonlinear dynamical systems theory.

Marginal likelihood inference for a model for item responses and response times,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X481360,NOV 2010,44,8,"Marginal maximum-likelihood procedures for parameter estimation and testing the fit of a hierarchical model for speed and accuracy on test items are presented. The model is a composition of two first-level models for dichotomous responses and response times along with multivariate normal models for their item and person parameters. It is shown how the item parameters can easily be estimated using Fisher's identity. To test the fit of the model, Lagrange multiplier tests of the assumptions of subpopulation invariance of the item parameters (i.e., no differential item functioning), the shape of the response functions, and three different types of conditional independence were derived. Simulation studies were used to show the feasibility of the estimation and testing procedures and to estimate the power and Type I error rate of the latter. In addition, the procedures were applied to an empirical data set from a computerized adaptive test of language comprehension.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,EM ALGORITHM,BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION,FIT ANALYSIS,IRT MODELS,PARAMETERS,ACCURACY,SPEED,TESTS","Glas, Cees A.

The effect of multiple indicators on the power to detect inter-individual differences in change,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X486633,NOV 2010,42,23,"Hertzog et al. evaluated the statistical power of linear latent growth curve models (LGCMs) to detect individual differences in change, i.e., variances of latent slopes, as a function of sample size, number of longitudinal measurement occasions, and growth curve reliability. We extend this work by investigating the effect of the number of indicators per measurement occasion on power. We analytically demonstrate that the positive effect of multiple indicators on statistical power is inversely related to the relative magnitude of occasion-specific latent residual variance and is independent of the specific model that constitutes the observed variables, in particular of other parameters in the LGCM. When designing a study, researchers have to consider trade-offs of costs and benefits of different design features. We demonstrate how knowledge about power equivalent transformations between indicator measurement designs allows researchers to identify the most cost-efficient research design for detecting parameters of interest. Finally, we integrate different formal results to exhibit the trade-off between the number of measurement occasions and number of indicators per occasion for constant power in LGCMs.",,"COVARIANCE STRUCTURE MODELS,STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,GROWTH CURVE MODELS,INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES,SAMPLE-SIZE,STATISTICAL POWER,COEFFICIENTS,RELIABILITY,MEMORY","von Oertzen, Timo@Max Planck Inst Human Dev, D-14195 Berlin, Germany::Hertzog, Christopher@Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::Lindenberger, Ulman@Max Planck Inst Human Dev, D-14195 Berlin, Germany::Ghisletta, Paolo@Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland@Distance Learning Univ, Geneva, Switzerland","von Oertzen, Timo@Max Planck Society::Hertzog, Christopher@University System of Georgia@Georgia Institute of Technology::Lindenberger, Ulman@Max Planck Society::Ghisletta, Paolo@University of Geneva","Lindenberger, Ulman@A-5846-2013::Ghisletta, Paolo@V-4782-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7731-2406::Lindenberger, Ulman@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8428-6453","no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::no title+Cronbach, LJ; Gleser, GC; Nanda, H<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rajaratnam, N</span>.+The dependability of behavioral measurements: theory of generalizability for scores and profiles+1972::Have multilevel models been structural equation models all along?+Curran, PJ+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+2003::A note on the relationship between the number of indicators and their reliability in detecting regression coefficients in latent regression analysis+Dolan, CV; Wicherts, JM; Molenaar, PCM+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+2004::no title+Duncan, T.

Extensions of Narens' theory of ratio magnitude estimation,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X486075,NOV 2010,33,3,"Stevens postulated that the responses of a participant in a ratio scaling experiment can be used directly to construct a psychophysical function. Today, it is generally accepted that the axioms of commutativity and multiplicativity are crucial for the interpretation of the subjects' ratio scaling behaviour. Empirical findings provide evidence that commutativity holds, whereas multiplicativity fails to hold across different sensory modalities. This shows that, in principle, Stevens' direct scaling methods yield measurements on a ratio scale level, but that the numerals occurring in a ratio scaling experiment cannot be taken at face value. Thus, Narens and others introduced a transformation function f, which converts the numerals used in an experiment into the latent mathematical numbers. The aim of the present paper is to specify the (unknown) shape of the transformation function f by analysing different extensions of the multiplicative property. The results provide evidence that f is either a power function or a logarithmic function.",,"GLOBAL PSYCHOPHYSICAL JUDGMENTS,EMPIRICAL-EVALUATION,WEIGHTING FUNCTION,TIME-ORDER,AXIOMS,MODEL","Augustin, Thomas@Graz Univ, Dept Psychol, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Augustin, Thomas@University of Graz",not exist,"no title+ANDERSON NH+ADV PSYCHOPHYSICS+1976::FUNCTIONAL MEASUREMENT AND PSYCHOPHYSICAL JUDGMENT+ANDERSON, NH+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+1970::no title+AUGUSTIN T+ADV PSYCHOL RES+2010::Empirical evaluation of the axioms of multiplicativity, commutativity, and monotonicity in ratio production of area+Augustin, Thomas; Maier, Katja+ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA+SEP 2008::Stevens' power law and the problem of meaningfulness+Augustin, Thomas+ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA+MAY 2008::Stevens' direct scaling methods and the uniqueness problem+Augustin, Thomas+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 2006::Measurement by subjective estimation: Testing for separable representations+Bernasconi, Michele; Choirat, Christine; Seri, Raffaello+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2008::no title+Campbell, N.

How to do a meta-analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X502733,NOV 2010,76,255,"Meta-analysis is a statistical tool for estimating the mean and variance of underlying population effects from a collection of empirical studies addressing ostensibly the same research question. Meta-analysis has become an increasing popular and valuable tool in psychological research, and major review articles typically employ these methods. This article describes the process of conducting meta-analysis: selecting articles, developing inclusion criteria, calculating effect sizes, conducting the actual analysis (including information on how to do the analysis on popular computer packages such as IBM SPSS and R) and estimating the effects of publication bias.

Power equivalence in structural equation modelling,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X441021,MAY 2010,36,16,"Implementing large-scale empirical studies can be very expensive. Therefore, it is useful to optimize study designs without losing statistical power. In this paper, we show how study designs can be improved without changing statistical power by defining power equivalence, a relation between structural equation models (SEMs) that holds true if two SEMs have the same power on a likelihood ratio test to detect a given effect. We show systematic operations of SEMs that maintain power, and give an algorithm that efficiently reduces SEMs to power-equivalent models with a minimal number of observed parameters. In this way, optimal study designs can be found without reducing statistical power. Furthermore, the algorithm can be used to drastically increase the speed of power computations when using Monte Carlo simulations or approximation methods.",,"COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST,SAMPLE-SIZE,PARAMETERS,GROWTH,RELIABILITY,INDICATORS,NUMBER","von Oertzen, Timo@Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Lifespan Psychol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","von Oertzen, Timo@Max Planck Society",not exist,"Power and money: Designing statistically powerful studies while minimizing financial costs+Allison, DB; Allison, RL; Faith, MS; et al.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 1997::no title+Baltes, P.

Two simple approximations to the distributions of quadratic forms,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X449771,MAY 2010,32,39,"Many test statistics are asymptotically equivalent to quadratic forms of normal variables, which are further equivalent to T=Sigma(d)(i=l)lambda(i)z(i)(2) with z(i) being independent and following N(0, 1). Two approximations to the distribution of T have been implemented in popular software and are widely used in evaluating various models. It is important to know how accurate these approximations are when compared to each other and to the exact distribution of T. The paper systematically studies the quality of the two approximations and examines the effect of the lambda(i) and the degrees of freedom d by analysis and Monte Carlo. The results imply that the adjusted distribution for T can be as good as knowing its exact distribution. When the coefficient of variation of the li is small, the rescaled statistic T(R)=dT/(Sigma(d)(i=1)lambda(i)) is also adequate for practical model inference. But comparing T(R) against chi(2)(d) will inflate type I errors when substantial differences exist among the lambda(i), especially, when d is also large.",,"COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,PRINCIPAL HESSIAN DIRECTIONS,SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION,CHI-SQUARED TEST,TEST STATISTICS,DIMENSION REDUCTION,HYPOTHESES,TESTS,MODEL","Yuan, Ke-Hai@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA::Bentler, Peter M.@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA","Yuan, Ke-Hai@University of Notre Dame::Bentler, Peter M.@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"no title+Bentler, P.

Testing and modelling non-normality within the one-factor model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X456935,MAY 2010,69,26,"Maximum likelihood estimation in the one-factor model is based on the assumption of multivariate normality for the observed data. This general distributional assumption implies three specific assumptions for the parameters in the one-factor model: the common factor has a normal distribution; the residuals are homoscedastic; and the factor loadings do not vary across the common factor scale. When any of these assumptions is violated, non-normality arises in the observed data. In this paper, a model is presented based on marginal maximum likelihood to enable explicit tests of these assumptions. In addition, the model is suitable to incorporate the detected violations, to enable statistical modelling of these effects.

The ad coefficient as a descriptive measure of the within-group agreement of ratings,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X465647,MAY 2010,23,4,"The ad coefficient was developed to measure the within-group agreement of ratings. The underlying theory as well as the construction of the coefficient are explained. The ad coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, regardless of the number of scale points, raters, or items. With some limitations the measure of the within-group agreement of different groups and groups from different studies is directly comparable. For statistical significance testing, the binomial distribution is introduced as a model of the ratings' random distribution given the true score of a group construct. This method enables a decision about essential agreement and not only about a significant difference from 0 or a chosen critical value. The ad coefficient identifies a single true score within a group. It is not provided for multiple true score settings. The comparison of the ad coefficient with other agreement indices shows that the new coefficient is in line with their outcomes, but does not result in infinite or inappropriate values.",,"INTERRATER AGREEMENT,RELIABILITY,R(WG),INDEXES","Kreuzpointner, Ludwig@Univ Regensburg, Inst Psychol, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany::Simon, Patricia@Unknow::Theis, Fabian J.@Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany","Kreuzpointner, Ludwig@University of Regensburg::Simon, Patricia@Unknow::Theis, Fabian J.@Helmholtz Association@Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health","Kreuzpointner, Ludwig@K-1741-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1391-0807::Theis, Fabian@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2419-1943","Within-group agreement, non-independence, and reliability: Implications for data aggregation and analysis+Bliese, P.

Measuring and detecting associations: Methods based on robust regression estimators or smoothers that allow curvature,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X467618,MAY 2010,44,3,"This paper considers the problem of estimating the overall strength of an association, including situations where there is curvature. The general strategy is to fit a robust regression line, or some type of smoother that allows curvature, and then use a robust analogue of explanatory power, say eta(2). When the regression surface is a plane, an estimate of eta(2) via the Theil-Sen estimator is found to perform well, relative to some other robust regression estimators, in terms of mean squared error and bias. When there is curvature, a generalization of a kernel estimator derived by Fan performs relatively well, but two alternative smoothers have certain practical advantages. When eta(2) is approximately equal to zero, estimation using smoothers has relatively high bias. A variation of eta(2) is suggested for dealing with this problem. Methods for testing H-0 : eta(2)=0 are examined that are based in part on smoothers. Two methods are found that control Type I error probabilities reasonably well in simulations.

Empirically indistinguishable multidimensional IRT and locally dependent unidimensional item response models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X466835,MAY 2010,76,35,"Multidimensionality is a core concept in the measurement and analysis of psychological data. In personality assessment, for example, constructs are mostly theoretically defined as unidimensional, yet responses collected from the real world are almost always determined by multiple factors. Significant research efforts have concentrated on the use of simulated studies to evaluate the robustness of unidimensional item response models when applied to multidimensional data with a dominant dimension. In contrast, in the present paper, I report the result from a theoretical investigation that a multidimensional item response model is empirically indistinguishable from a locally dependent unidimensional model, of which the single dimension represents the actual construct of interest. A practical implication of this result is that multidimensional response data do not automatically require the use of multidimensional models. Circumstances under which the alternative approach of locally dependent unidimensional models may be useful are discussed.",,"LATENT TRAIT MODEL,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,MIXED-MODEL,OUTCOMES,DIMENSIONALITY,ASSUMPTION,ROBUSTNESS,TESTLETS,BUNDLES","Ip, Edward Haksing@Wake Forest Univ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA","Ip, Edward Haksing@Wake Forest University",not exist,"no title+Abadir,, K.M.; Magnus,, J.R.+Matrix Algebra.+2005::UNIDIMENSIONAL IRT CALIBRATION OF COMPENSATORY AND NONCOMPENSATORY MULTIDIMENSIONAL ITEMS+ACKERMAN, TA+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUN 1989::The multidimensional random coefficients multinomial logit model+Adams, RJ; Wilson, M; Wang, WC+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 1997::An examination of the characteristics of unidimensional IRT parameter estimates derived from two-dimensional data+Ansley, T.

Acquiescence as a source of bias and model and person misfit: A theoretical and empirical analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X470740,MAY 2010,50,28,"In personality and attitude measurement, the presence of acquiescent responding can have an impact on the whole process of item calibration and test scoring, and this can occur even when sensible procedures for controlling acquiescence are used. This paper considers a bidimensional (content acquiescence) factor-analytic model to be the correct model, and assesses the effects of fitting unidimensional models to theoretically unidimensional scales when acquiescence is in fact operating. The analysis considers two types of scales: non-balanced and fully balanced. The effects are analysed at both the calibration and the scoring stages, and are of two types: bias in the item/respondent parameter estimates and model/person misfit. The results obtained theoretically are checked and assessed by means of simulation. The results and predictions are then assessed in an empirical study based on two personality scales. The implications of the results for applied personality research are discussed.",,"ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,BALANCED MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALES,FACTOR-ANALYTIC PROCEDURES,FIT,STYLE,GOODNESS,INDEXES,TESTS","Ferrando, Pere J.@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Fac Psicol, Res Ctr Behav Assessment, Dept Psychol, Tarragona 43007, Spain::Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@Unknow","Ferrando, Pere J.@Universitat Rovira i Virgili::Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@Unknow","Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@G-4228-2011::Ferrando, Pere@J-9857-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3133-5466::lorenzo-seva, Urbano@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5369-3099","THE MEASUREMENT-STATISTICS CONTROVERSY - FACTOR-ANALYSIS AND SUBINTERVAL DATA+ATKINSON, L+BULLETIN OF THE PSYCHONOMIC SOCIETY+JUL 1988::Effects of stem and likert response option reversals on survey internal consistency: If you feel the need, there is a better alternative to using those negatively worded stems+Barnette, JJ+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUN 2000::THE STATISTICAL CONCEPTION OF MENTAL FACTORS+Bartlett, M.

Cocaine addiction and personality: A mathematical model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X470768,MAY 2010,70,8,"The existence of a close relation between personality and drug consumption is recognized, but the corresponding causal connection is not well known. Neither is it well known whether personality exercises an influence predominantly at the beginning and development of addiction, nor whether drug consumption produces changes in personality. This paper presents a dynamic mathematical model of personality and addiction based on the unique personality trait theory (UPTT) and the general modelling methodology. This model attempts to integrate personality, the acute effect of drugs, and addiction. The UPTT states the existence of a unique trait of personality called extraversion, understood as a dimension that ranges from impulsive behaviour and sensation-seeking (extravert pole) to fearful and anxious behaviour (introvert pole). As a consequence of drug consumption, the model provides the main patterns of extraversion dynamics through a system of five coupled differential equations. It combines genetic extraversion, as a steady state, and dynamic extraversion in a unique variable measured on the hedonic scale. The dynamics of this variable describes the effects of stimulant drugs on a short-term time scale (typical of the acute effect); while its mean time value describes the effects of stimulant drugs on a long-term time scale (typical of the addiction effect). This understanding may help to develop programmes of prevention and intervention in drug misuse.",,"STRIATAL C-FOS,ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES,SUBSTANCE-ABUSE,HUMAN BRAIN,BEHAVIOR,SENSITIZATION,DOPAMINE,TRAITS,DRUG,PSYCHOPATHOLOGY","Caselles, Antonio@Univ Valencia, Dept Matemat Aplicada, E-46100 Valencia, Spain::Mico, Joan C.@Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Univ Matemat Pura & Aplicada, Valencia, Spain::Amigo, Salvador@Univ Valencia, Dept Personalitat Avaluacio & Tractaments Psicol, E-46100 Valencia, Spain","Caselles, Antonio@University of Valencia::Mico, Joan C.@Universitat Politecnica de Valencia::Amigo, Salvador@University of Valencia","Mico, Joan C.@K-5683-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7120-5458","no title+no author+Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders+2000::no title+AMIGO S+INFORM PSICOLOGICA+2002::no title+AMIGO S+INFORM PSICOLOGICA+1999::no title+Amigo, S.+La teoria del rasgo unico de personalidad: Hacia una teoria unificada del cerebro y la conducta+2005::A dynamic extraversion model.

The impact of omitting the interaction between crossed factors in cross-classified random effects modelling,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X398968,FEB 2010,18,18,"Cross-classified random effects modelling (CCREM) is a special case of multi-level modelling where the units of one level are nested within two cross-classified factors. Typically, CCREM analyses omit the random interaction effect of the cross-classified factors. We investigate the impact of the omission of the interaction effect on parameter estimates and standard errors. Results from a Monte Carlo simulation study indicate that, for fixed effects, both coefficients estimates and accompanied standard error estimates are not biased. For random effects, results are affected at level 2 but not at level 1 by the presence of an interaction variance and/or a correlation between the residual of level two factors. Results from the analysis of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study and the National Educational Longitudinal Study agree with those obtained from simulated data. We recommend that researchers attempt to include interaction effects of cross-classified factors in their models.",,"MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS,LEVEL,COUNTRIES,CONSEQUENCE,PERFORMANCE,RATINGS","Shi, Yuying@Unknow::Leite, Walter@Univ Florida, Dept Educ Psychol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA::Algina, James@Unknow","Shi, Yuying@Unknow::Leite, Walter@University of Florida@State University System of Florida::Algina, James@Unknow","Leite, Walter@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7655-5668","ETA-SQUARED AND PARTIAL ETA-SQUARED IN FIXED FACTOR ANOVA DESIGNS+COHEN, J+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+1973::Multilevel investigation of variation in HoNOS ratings by mental health professionals: a naturalistic study of consecutive referrals+Ecob, R; Croudace, TJ; White, IR; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF METHODS IN PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH+2004::Teaching groups as foci for evaluating performance in cost-effectiveness of GCE advanced level provision: Some practical methodological innovations+Fielding, A+SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT+2002::NEIGHBORHOOD EFFECTS ON EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT - A MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS+GARNER, CL; RAUDENBUSH, SW+SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION+OCT 1991::Robustness studies in covariance structure modeling - An overview and a meta-analysis+Hoogland, JJ; Boomsma, A+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+FEB 1998::Business segment performance redux: A multilevel approach+Hough, JR+STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL+JAN 2006::A multilevel cross-classified modelling approach to peer review of grant proposals: the effects of assessor and researcher attributes on assessor ratings+Jayasinghe, UW; Marsh, HW; Bond, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2003::The impact of inappropriate modeling of cross-classified data structures+Meyers, Jason L.; Beretvas, S.

Analysis of ordinal categorical data with misclassification,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X401314,FEB 2010,27,7,"We develop a method for the analysis of multivariate ordinal categorical data with misclassification based on the latent normal variable approach. Misclassification arises if a subject has been classified into a category that does not truly reflect its actual state, and can occur with one or more variables. A basic framework is developed to enable the analysis of two types of data. The first corresponds to a single sample that is obtained from a fallible design that may lead to misclassified data. The other corresponds to data that is obtained by double sampling. Double sampling data consists of two parts: a sample that is obtained by classifying subjects using the fallible design only and a sample that is obtained by classifying subjects using both fallible and true designs, which is assumed to have no misclassification. A unified expectation-maximization approach is developed to find the maximum likelihood estimate of model parameters. Simulation studies and examples that are based on real data are used to demonstrate the applicability and practicability of the proposed methods.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,LATENT VARIABLE MODELS,DOUBLE SAMPLING SCHEME,EM ALGORITHM,DATA AUGMENTATION,BINOMIAL DATA,DISTRIBUTIONS,ERRORS","Poon, Wai-Yin@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Wang, Hai-Bin@Xiamen Univ, Sch Math Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China","Poon, Wai-Yin@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Wang, Hai-Bin@Xiamen University",not exist,"Modeling discrete choice with response error: Food stamp participation+Bollinger, CR; David, MH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::DOUBLE SAMPLING FOR EXACT VALUES IN SOME MULTIVARIATE MEASUREMENT ERROR PROBLEMS+BUONACCORSI, JP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1990::Estimation of a logistic regression model with mismeasured observations+Chen, KF; Hsueh, HM+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2003::2-SAMPLE TEST FOR INDEPENDENCE IN 2X2 CONTINGENCY-TABLES WITH BOTH MARGINS SUBJECT TO MISCLASSIFICATION+CHIACCHIERINI, RP; ARNOLD, JC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::1977 RIETZ LECTURE - BOOTSTRAP METHODS - ANOTHER LOOK AT THE JACKKNIFE+EFRON, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::Latent variable models for misclassified polytomous outcome variables+Eickhoff, JC; Amemiya, Y+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 2005::A GENERAL-APPROACH TO ANALYZING EPIDEMIOLOGIC DATA THAT CONTAIN MISCLASSIFICATION ERRORS+ESPELAND, MA; HUI, SL+BIOMETRICS+DEC 1987::LOG-LINEAR MODELS FOR DOUBLY SAMPLED CATEGORICAL-DATA FITTED BY THE EM ALGORITHM+ESPELAND, MA; ODOROFF, CL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::STOCHASTIC RELAXATION, GIBBS DISTRIBUTIONS, AND THE BAYESIAN RESTORATION OF IMAGES+GEMAN, S; GEMAN, D+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+1984::EXPLORATORY LATENT STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS USING BOTH IDENTIFIABLE AND UNIDENTIFIABLE MODELS+GOODMAN, LA+BIOMETRIKA+1974::no title+HABERMAN SJ+ANAL QUALITATIVE DAT+1979::USE OF DOUBLE SAMPLING SCHEMES IN ANALYZING CATEGORICAL DATA WITH MISCLASSIFICATION ERRORS+HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::no title+JONES PN+J STAT COMPUT SIM+1992::Maximum likelihood estimation of two-level latent variable models with mixed continuous and polytomous data+Lee, SY; Shi, JQ+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2001::Parameter expansion to accelerate EM: The PX-EM algorithm+Liu, CH; Rubin, DB; Wu, YN+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1998::A FAST IMPROVEMENT TO THE EM ALGORITHM ON ITS OWN TERMS+MEILIJSON, I+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1989::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION VIA THE ECM ALGORITHM - A GENERAL FRAMEWORK+MENG, XL; RUBIN, DB+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1993::AN INVESTIGATION OF EFFECT OF MISCLASSIFICATION ON PROPERTIES OF X2-TESTS IN ANALYSIS OF CATEGORICAL DATA+MOTE, VL; ANDERSON, RL+BIOMETRIKA+1965::PRECISION OF DOUBLE SAMPLING ESTIMATORS FOR COMPARING 2 PROBABILITIES+PALMGREN, J+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1987::INFERENCE USING SURROGATE OUTCOME DATA AND A VALIDATION SAMPLE+PEPE, MS+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1992::ESTIMATING FROM MISCLASSIFIED DATA+PRESS, SJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1968::THE CALCULATION OF POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS BY DATA AUGMENTATION+TANNER, MA; WING, HW+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1987::DOUBLE SAMPLING SCHEME FOR ESTIMATING FROM BINOMIAL DATA WITH MISCLASSIFICATIONS - SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION+TENENBEIN, A+BIOMETRICS+1971::DOUBLE SAMPLING SCHEME FOR ESTIMATING FROM BINOMIAL DATA WITH MISCLASSIFICATIONS+TENENBEIN, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1970::A MONTE-CARLO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EM ALGORITHM AND THE POOR MANS DATA AUGMENTATION ALGORITHMS+WEI, GCG; TANNER, MA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1990::Estimating the polychoric correlation from misclassified data+Yiu, Choi-Fan; Poon, Wai-Yin+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2008"
Do changes in the subjective experience of recognition over time suggest independent processes?,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X416416,FEB 2010,43,6,"Two experiments examined the nature of recognition memory by asking how subjective reports of remembering change over time. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to report their experience of remembering using the well-known remember-know-guess procedure. Estimates of recollection declined over a 14-day period, but estimates of familiarity remained constant, suggesting that the processes are independent. In Experiment 2, participants were asked to report their confidence in their recognition decisions. Subjective reports of confidence were analysed via receiver operating characteristics and also indicated different rates of decline for recollection and familiarity. Superficially, the data appear to support a dual-process account of recognition, but close inspection shows the data to be consistent with a simple signal detection model. The conclusion is that although the phenomenal experience of remembering changes over time this is most likely to be predicated on a single process.",,"RECEIVER-OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS,SIGNAL-DETECTION-THEORY,RECOLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE,DECISION-PROCESSES,DETECTION MODEL,MEMORY,REMEMBER,FAMILIARITY,METAANALYSIS,PERFORMANCE","Tunney, Richard J.@Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Tunney, Richard J.@University of Nottingham",not exist,"Word frequency and receiver operating characteristic curves in recognition memory: Evidence for a dual-process interpretation+Arndt, J; Reder, LA+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION+SEP 2002::THE MRC PSYCHOLINGUISTIC DATABASE+COLTHEART, M+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY SECTION A-HUMAN EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY+1981::The mirror effect and mixture signal detection theory+DeCarlo, Lawrence T.+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION+JAN 2007::Models of recognition: A review of arguments in favor of a dual-process account+Diana, RA; Reder, LM; Arndt, J; et al.+PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN &amp; REVIEW+FEB 2006::MEASURING RECOGNITION MEMORY+DONALDSON, W+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL+SEP 1992::The role of decision processes in remembering and knowing+Donaldson, W+MEMORY &amp; COGNITION+JUL 1996::The dimensionality of the remember-know task: A state-trace analysis+Dunn, John C.+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+APR 2008::The Four-States Model of Memory Retrieval Experiences+Erdfelder, Edgar; Cuepper, Lutz; Auer, Tina-Sarah; et al.+ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHOLOGIE-JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY+2007::Remembering and knowing+Gardiner, JM; Richardson-Klavehn, A.+Handbook of memory+2000::Recognition memory and decision processes: A meta-analysis of remember, know, and guess responses+Gardiner, JM; Ramponi, C; Richardson-Klavehn, A+MEMORY+MAR 2002::FORGETTING IN RECOGNITION MEMORY WITH AND WITHOUT RECOLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE+GARDINER, JM; JAVA, RI+MEMORY &amp; COGNITION+NOV 1991::ATTENTION AND RECOLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE IN RECOGNITION MEMORY+GARDINER, JM; PARKIN, AJ+MEMORY &amp; COGNITION+NOV 1990::FUNCTIONAL-ASPECTS OF RECOLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE+GARDINER, JM+MEMORY &amp; COGNITION+JUL 1988::Slope of the receiver-operating characteristic in recognition memory+Glanzer, M; Kim, K; Hilford, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION+MAR 1999::no title+Green, D.

Denoising forced-choice detection data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X424057,FEB 2010,56,17,"Observers in a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) detection task face the need to produce a response at random (a guess) on trials in which neither presentation appeared to display a stimulus. Observers could alternatively be instructed to use a 'guess' key on those trials, a key that would produce a random guess and would also record the resultant correct or wrong response as emanating from a computer-generated guess. A simulation study shows that 'denoising' 2AFC data with information regarding which responses are a result of guesses yields estimates of detection threshold and spread of the psychometric function that are far more precise than those obtained in the absence of this information, and parallel the precision of estimates obtained with yes-no tasks running for the same number of trials. Simulations also show that partial compliance with the instructions to use the 'guess' key reduces the quality of the estimates, which nevertheless continue to be more precise than those obtained from conventional 2AFC data if the observers are still moderately compliant. An empirical study testing the validity of simulation results showed that denoised 2AFC estimates of spread were clearly superior to conventional 2AFC estimates and similar to yes-no estimates, but variations in threshold across observers and across sessions hid the benefits of denoising for threshold estimation. The empirical study also proved the feasibility of using a 'guess' key in addition to the conventional response keys defined in 2AFC tasks.",,"PROBED-SINEWAVE PARADIGM,FIXED STEP SIZES,ADAPTIVE PSYCHOPHYSICAL PROCEDURES,CONTRAST DETECTION,PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTIONS,SPATIAL-FREQUENCY,LIGHT-ADAPTATION,STATISTICAL PROPERTIES,EMPIRICAL PERFORMANCE,THRESHOLD ESTIMATION","Garcia-Perez, Miguel A.@Univ Complutense, Fac Psicol, Dept Metodol, Madrid 28223, Spain","Garcia-Perez, Miguel A.@Complutense University of Madrid","Garcia-Perez, Miguel Angel@F-7043-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2669-4429","Interval bias in discrimination tasks+Alcala-Quintana, R; Garcia-Perez, MA+PERCEPTION+2005::Empirical performance of optimal Bayesian adaptive psychophysical methods+Alcala-Quintana, R; Garcia-Perez, MA+PERCEPTION+2004::The role of parametric assumptions in adaptive Bayesian estimation+Alcala-Quintana, R; Garcia-Perez, MA+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+JUN 2004::A comparison of fixed-step-size and Bayesian staircases for sensory threshold estimation+Alcala-Quintana, Rocio; Garcia-Perez, Miguel A.+SPATIAL VISION+2007::Empirical Performance of Optimal Bayesian Adaptive Estimation+Angel Garcia-Perez, Miguel; Alcala-Quintana, Rocio+SPANISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2009::Efficient adaptive procedures for threshold and concurrent slope estimates for psychophysics and speech intelligibility tests+Brand, T; Kollmeier, B+JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA+JUN 2002::TEMPORAL SUMMATION OF MOVING IMAGES BY THE HUMAN VISUAL-SYSTEM+BURR, DC+PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES+1981::Temporal impulse response functions for luminance and colour during saccades+Burr, DC; Morrone, MC+VISION RESEARCH+JUL 1996::SPATIAL-FREQUENCY ADAPTATION CAN ENHANCE CONTRAST SENSITIVITY+DEVALOIS, KK+VISION RESEARCH+1977::Denoising forced-choice detection data+Garcia-Perez, M.

Monte Carlo tests of the Rasch model based on scalability coefficients,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X424200,FEB 2010,27,9,"For item responses fitting the Rasch model, the assumptions underlying the Mokken model of double monotonicity are met. This makes non-parametric item response theory a natural starting-point for Rasch item analysis. This paper studies scalability coefficients based on Loevinger's H coefficient that summarizes the number of Guttman errors in the data matrix. These coefficients are shown to yield efficient tests of the Rasch model using p-values computed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The power of the tests of unequal item discrimination, and their ability to distinguish between local dependence and unequal item discrimination, are discussed. The methods are illustrated and motivated using a simulation study and a real data example.",,MOKKEN SCALE,"Christensen, Karl Bang@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biostat, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark::Kreiner, Svend@Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biostat, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark","Christensen, Karl Bang@University of Copenhagen::Kreiner, Svend@University of Copenhagen","Christensen, Karl Bang@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4518-5187","CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::GENERALIZED MONTE-CARLO SIGNIFICANCE TESTS+BESAG, J; CLIFFORD, P+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1989::Exact tests for the Rasch model via sequential importance sampling+Chen, YG; Small, D+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2005::Comparison of four IRT models when analyzing two tests for inductive reasoning+de Koning, E; Sijtsma, K; Hamers, JHM+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 2002::no title+Fischer, G.; Molenaar, I.+Rasch models: Foundations, recent developments and applications+1995::no title+Fisher, R.A.+Statistical Methods for Research Workers+1925::THE DERIVATION OF SOME TESTS FOR THE RASCH MODEL FROM THE MULTINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION+GLAS, CAW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1988::no title+GUTTMAN L+STUDIES SOCIAL PSYCH+1950::no title+HOLST C+THESIS NATL I ED RES+1995::LOGLINEAR RASCH MODEL TESTS+KELDERMAN, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1984::no title+LOEVINGER J+PSYCHOL MONOGRAPHS A+1947::THE TECHNIC OF HOMOGENEOUS TESTS COMPARED WITH SOME ASPECTS OF SCALE ANALYSIS AND FACTOR ANALYSIS+LOEVINGER, J+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1948::EXACT TESTS, CONFIDENCE REGIONS AND ESTIMATES+MARTINLOF, P+SYNTHESE+1977::no title+Mokken, R.

Model-based principal components of covariance matrices,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X428189,FEB 2010,65,1,A flexible class of models is proposed for principal component (PCs) of covariance matrices. The models allow constraints to be imposed on the eigenvalues and/or the eigenvectors and yield simplified PCs that retain their variance maximization and orthogonality properties. The models are fitted to sample covariance matrices by minimizing a discrepancy function. Asymptotic distributions of estimators are obtained under the assumption that fourth-order moments of the parent distribution are finite. Hypothesis tests are obtained by comparing discrepancy functions that are minimized under different constraints. An Edgeworth expansion is used to obtain second-order accurate confidence intervals for differentiable eigenfunctions. The techniques are illustrated on a real data set.,,"IMPLICIT FUNCTION-APPROACH,ASYMPTOTIC-EXPANSION,LATENT ROOTS,STATISTICAL VARIABLES,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,STANDARD ERRORS,SAMPLE ROOTS,TESTS,DISTRIBUTIONS,EIGENVALUES","Boik, Robert J.@Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA::Panishkan, Kamolchanok@Silpakorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Stat, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand::Hyde, Scott K.@Brigham Young Univ, Dept Math, Laie, HI USA","Boik, Robert J.@Montana State University@Montana State University Bozeman@Montana State University System::Panishkan, Kamolchanok@Silpakorn University::Hyde, Scott K.@Brigham Young University - Hawaii@Brigham Young University",not exist,"AN ASYMPTOTIC-EXPANSION FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LATENT ROOTS OF THE ESTIMATED COVARIANCE-MATRIX+ANDERSON, GA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1965::ASYMPTOTIC THEORY FOR PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS+ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1963::Test of linear trend in eigenvalues of a covariance matrix with application to data analysis+Bentler, PM; Yuan, KH+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1996::BOOTSTRAP TESTS AND CONFIDENCE-REGIONS FOR FUNCTIONS OF A COVARIANCE-MATRIX+BERAN, R; SRIVASTAVA, MS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1985::Principal components on coefficient of variation matrices+Boik, R.J.; Shirvani, A.+Stat.

Although both measures can be useful for quantifying social reciprocity, researchers need to know whether these estimators are biased in order properly to assess descriptive results. That is, if estimators are biased, researchers should compare actual values with expected values under the specified null hypothesis. Furthermore, standard errors are needed to enable suitable assessment of discrepancies between actual and expected values.

A method of bias correction for maximal reliability with dichotomous measures,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X429494,FEB 2010,16,0,"This paper is concerned with the reliability of weighted combinations of a given set of dichotomous measures. Maximal reliability for such measures has been discussed in the past, but the pertinent estimator exhibits a considerable bias and mean squared error for moderate sample sizes. We examine this bias, propose a procedure for bias correction, and develop a more accurate asymptotic confidence interval for the resulting estimator. In most empirically relevant cases, the bias correction and mean squared error correction can be performed simultaneously. We propose an approximate (asymptotic) confidence interval for the maximal reliability coefficient, discuss the implementation of this estimator, and investigate the mean squared error of the associated asymptotic approximation. We illustrate the proposed methods using a numerical example.",,COEFFICIENT,"Penev, Spiridon@Univ New S Wales, Dept Stat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia::Raykov, Tenko@Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Penev, Spiridon@University of New South Wales Sydney::Raykov, Tenko@Michigan State University","Penev, Spiridon@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3669-0010","no title+Bartholomew, D.

Using fractional polynomials to model non-linear trends in longitudinal data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X431509,FEB 2010,43,34,"Non-linear growth curves are discussed within the context of the linear mixed model. Non-linearity is modelled with time transformations known as fractional polynomials (FPs) having power terms that can be negative values and fractions with conventional polynomials (CPs) as a special case. Issues of interpretation are discussed with a focus on the instantaneous rate of change in models with and without static correlates. Methods for model selection are presented with emphasis on penalized and non-penalized indices of global fit based on the maximized likelihood and fitted models. Two empirical examples are presented with psychological data in which FPs were fitted along with CPs of equal and next highest order. The results show that the FPs had equal or better fit than the higher-order CPs and had prediction curves with as favourable or more favourable characteristics, such as less extreme behaviour at the edges of the observed time intervals. The results illustrate some of the potential advantages of FPs relative to CPs, which include parsimony, flexibility of curve shape, and the ability to approximate asymptotes. Though FPs are not necessarily suggested as replacements for CPs or other transformations (e.g. piecewise models), they might be useful when the goal is to model non-linear growth trends with smooth curves.",,"MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,CURVE ANALYSIS,VARIABLES,SELECTION,TRANSFORMATION,SCHIZOPHRENIA,EPIDEMIOLOGY","Long, Jeffrey@Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Ryoo, Jihoon@Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Long, Jeffrey@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System::Ryoo, Jihoon@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System","Ryoo, Ji Hoon@J-5164-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7546-6911::Long, Jeffrey@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7181-9652","no title+BATES D+R NEWS+2005::no title+Belsley, D.

Investigating the relationship between item exposure and test overlap: Item sharing and item pooling,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X430906,FEB 2010,11,3,"To date, exposure control procedures that are designed to control item exposure and test overlap simultaneously are based on the assumption of item sharing between pairs of examinees. However, examinees may obtain test information from more than one examinee in practice. This larger scope of information sharing needs to be taken into account in refining exposure control procedures. To control item exposure and test overlap among a group of examinees larger than two, the relationship between the two indices needs to be identified first. The purpose of this paper is to analytically derive the relationships between item exposure rate and each of the two forms of test overlap, item sharing and item pooling, for fixed-length computerized adaptive tests. Item sharing is defined as the number of common items shared by all examinees in a group, while item pooling is the number of overlapping items that an examinee has with a group of examinees. The accuracy of the derived relationships was verified using numerical examples. The relationships derived will lay the foundation for future development of procedures to simultaneously control item exposure and item sharing or item pooling among a group of examinees larger than two.",,,"Chen, Shu-Ying@Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Psychol, Chiayi 62107, Taiwan::Lei, Pui-Wa@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Chen, Shu-Ying@National Chung Cheng University::Lei, Pui-Wa@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University","Lei, Pui-Wa@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8179-6623","a-stratified multistage computerized adaptive testing+Chang, HH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1999::Hypergeometric family and item overlap rates in computerized adaptive testing+Chang, HH; Zhang, JM+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::Controlling item exposure and test overlap on the fly in computerized adaptive testing+Chen, Shu-Ying; Lei, Pui-Wa; Liao, Wen-Han+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 2008::Controlling item exposure and test overlap in computerized adaptive testing+Chen, SY; Lei, PW+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAY 2005::Effects of practical constraints on item selection rules at the early stages of computerized adaptive testing+Chen, SY; Ankenmann, RD+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SUM 2004::The relationship between item exposure and test overlap in computerized adaptive testing+Chen, SY; Ankenmann, RD; Spray, JA+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SUM 2003::New algorithms for item selection and exposure control with computerized adaptive testing+Davey, T; Parshall, CG.+ANN M AM ED RES ASS+1995::A comparison of item exposure control methods in computerized adaptive testing+Revuelta, J; Ponsoda, V+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+WIN 1998::Controlling item exposure conditional on ability in computerized adaptive testing+Stocking, ML; Lewis, C+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SPR 1998::Controlling item-exposure rates in computerized adaptive testing+Sympson, J.

Random-effects meta-analysis of correlations: Monte Carlo evaluation of mean estimators,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711009X431914,FEB 2010,38,11,"Several authors have cautioned against using Fisher's z-transformation in random-effects meta-analysis of correlations, which seems to perform poorly in some situations, especially with substantial inter-study heterogeneity. Attributing this performance largely to the direct z-to-r transformation (DZRT) of Fisher z results (e.g. point estimate of mean correlation), in a previous paper Hafdahl (2009) proposed point and interval estimators of the mean Pearson r correlation that instead use an integral z-to-r transformation (IZRT). The present Monte Carlo study of these IZRT Fisher z estimators includes comparisons with their DZRT counterparts and with estimators based on Pearson r correlations. The IZRT point estimator was usually more accurate and efficient than its DZRT counterpart and comparable to the two Pearson r point estimators - better in some conditions but worse in others. Coverage probability for the IZRT confidence intervals (CIs) was often near nominal, much better than for the DZRT CIs, and comparable to coverage for the Pearson r CIs; every approach's CI fell markedly below nominal in some conditions. The IZRT estimators contradict warnings about Fisher z estimators' poor performance. Recommendations for practising research synthesists are offered, and an Appendix provides computing code to implement the IZRT as in the real-data example.",,"RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS,VALIDITY GENERALIZATION,CORRELATION-COEFFICIENTS,SITUATIONAL SPECIFICITY,FISHERS-Z,BIAS,STABILITY","Hafdahl, Adam R.@Washington Univ, Dept Math, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Hafdahl, Adam R.@Washington University (WUSTL)","Hafdahl, Adam@I-7738-2012::Rohlf, F@A-8710-2008","no title+BECKER BJ+RES SOCIOLOGY ORG+1989::A simple method for inference on an overall effect in meta-analysis+Brockwell, Sarah E.; Gordon, Ian R.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+NOV 10 2007::Meta-analytic structural equation modeling: A two-stage approach+Cheung, MWL; Chan, W+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 2005::Dependent effect sizes in meta-analysis: Incorporating the degree of interdependence+Cheung, SF; Chan, DKS+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+OCT 2004::Random-effects model for meta-analysis of clinical trials: An update+DerSimonian, Rebecca; Kacker, Raghu+CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS+FEB 2007::Higher-order factors of the big five+Digman, JM+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+DEC 1997::Using random rather than fixed effects models in meta-analysis: Implications for situational specificity and validity generalization+Erez, A; Bloom, MC; Wells, MT+PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY+SUM 1996::Is the meta-analysis of correlation coefficients accurate when population correlations vary?+Field, AP+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2005::Meta-analysis of correlation coefficients: A Monte Carlo comparison of fixed- and random-effects methods+Field, AP+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+JUN 2001::Improved Fisher z estimators for univariate random-effects meta-analysis of correlations+Hafdahl, Adam R.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2009::Meta-Analysis of Correlations Revisited: Attempted Replication and Extension of Field's (2001) Simulation Studies+Hafdahl, Adam R.; Williams, Michelle A.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 2009::no title+HAFDAHL AR+ANN M PSYCH SOC MONT+2004::no title+HAFDAHL AR+M PSYCH SOC DURH NH+2008::no title+Hafdahl, AR.+Multivariate meta-analysis for exploratory factor analytic research+2001::Comparison of two random-effects methods of meta-analysis+Hall, SM; Brannick, MT+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+APR 2002::no title+Hedges, L; Olkin, I.+Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis+1985::The meta- analysis of test validity studies: Some new approaches+Hedges, L.

Model-related factor score predictors for confirmatory factor analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X336146,NOV 2009,22,8,"The present paper introduces model-related (MR) factor score predictors, which reflect specific aspects of confirmatory factor models. The development is mainly based on Schonemann and Steiger's regression score components, but it can also be applied to the factor score coefficients. It is shown that the rotation of factor score predictors has no impact on the covariance matrix reproduced from the corresponding regression component patterns. Thus, regression score components or factor score coefficients can be rotated in order to obtain the required properties. This idea is the basis for MR factor score predictors, which are computed by means of a partial Procrustes rotation towards a target pattern representing the interesting properties of a confirmatory factor model. Two examples demonstrate the construction of MR factor score predictors reflecting specific constraints of a factor model.",,"PARTIALLY SPECIFIED TARGET,CRYSTALLIZED INTELLIGENCE,FACTOR-INDETERMINACY,ROTATION,FLUID","Beauducel, Andre@Univ Fed Armed Forces Hamburg, Helmut Schmidt Univ, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany::Rabe, Sirko@Tech Univ Dresden, D-8027 Dresden, Germany","Beauducel, Andre@Unknow::Rabe, Sirko@Dresden University of Technology",not exist,"no title+ANDERSON TW+3RD P BERK S MATH ST+1956::THE STATISTICAL CONCEPTION OF MENTAL FACTORS+Bartlett, M.

On the modelling and estimation of attribute rankings with ties in the Thurstonian framework,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X337703,NOV 2009,29,2,A Thurstonian type approach is applied to modelling ranking data with ties. It uses a non-totally differentiable discriminational process instead of the conventional totally differential one to relate the observed rankings and the underlying subjective values. A Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed to find the maximum likelihood estimates together with the standard errors of the parameters. The approach is examined numerically by means of an artificial example and a simulation study and is applied to a study of attribute assessment.,,"COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,COMPARATIVE JUDGMENT,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,DATA AUGMENTATION,IPSATIVE DATA,EM ALGORITHM,DISTRIBUTIONS,LAW","Poon, Wai-Yin@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Xu, Liang@Southeast Univ, Dept Math, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Poon, Wai-Yin@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Xu, Liang@Southeast University - China",not exist,"GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR PARAMETER ESTIMATION FOR LAW OF COMPARATIVE JUDGMENT+ARBUCKLE, J; NUGENT, JH+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1973::THURSTONIAN REPRESENTATION FOR PARTIAL RANKING DATA+BOCKENHOLT, U+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1992::A Thurstonian analysis of preference change+Bockenholt, U+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+JUN 2002::FACTOR AND IDEAL POINT ANALYSIS FOR INTERPERSONALLY INCOMPARABLE DATA+BRADY, HE+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 1989::no title+CARROLL DJ+DECISION SCI+1990::Covariance structure analysis of partially additive ipsative data using restricted maximum likelihood estimation+Chan, W; Bentler, PM+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1996::Covariance structure analysis of ordinal ipsative data+Chan, W; Bentler, PM+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1998::PREDICTIVE TESTING OF CONSUMER CHOICE MODELS NOT SUBJECT TO INDEPENDENCE OF IRRELEVANT ALTERNATIVES+CURRIM, IS+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+1982::no title+David, H.

Robust model fitting for the non linear structural equation model under normal theory,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X345966,NOV 2009,35,1,"Structural equation modelling has been widely applied in behavioural, educational, medical, social, and psychological research. The classical maximum likelihood estimate is vulnerable to outliers and non-normal data. In this paper, a robust estimation method for the nonlinear structural equation model is proposed. This method gives more weight to data that are likely to occur based on the structure of the posited model, and effectively downweights the influence of outliers. An algorithm is proposed to obtain the robust estimator. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are investigated, which include the asymptotic distribution of the estimator, and some statistics for hypothesis testing. Results from a simulation study and a real data example show that our procedure is effective.",,"COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,LATENT-VARIABLES","Xia, Ye-Mao@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Song, Xin-Yuan@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Lee, Sik-Yum@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Xia, Ye-Mao@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Song, Xin-Yuan@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Lee, Sik-Yum@Chinese University of Hong Kong",not exist,"no title+BENTLER PM+EQS 6 WINDOWS USERS+2002::no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::Covariance structures+Browne, M.W.+Tapies in Applied Multivariate Analysis+1982::ROBUSTNESS OF STATISTICAL-INFERENCE IN FACTOR-ANALYSIS AND RELATED MODELS+BROWNE, MW+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1987::ROBUSTNESS OF NORMAL THEORY METHODS IN THE ANALYSIS OF LINEAR LATENT VARIATE MODELS+BROWNE, MW; SHAPIRO, A+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1988::Robust procedures in multivariate analysis.

The main purpose of this paper is to show that, in spite of his inadequate tools and concepts, Sir Godfrey Thomson's approach of 70 years ago was on the right lines. His thinking was constrained by the primitive state of his statistical understanding but it is illuminated by his substantial exchange of the correspondence with M. S. Bartlett in the 1930s, most of which has survived in the Godfrey Thomson archive at the University of Edinburgh. In order to justify our claim and clarify the issues, we have found it necessary to fill in some of the gaps in the original derivations of Spearman, Thomson and Bartlett and to express their work in terms which are intelligible today.

Oblique rotation in correspondence analysis: A step forward in the search for the simplest interpretation,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X368295,NOV 2009,26,8,"Correspondence analysis ( CA) is a popular method that can be used to analyse relationships between categorical variables. It is closely related to several popular multivariate analysis methods such as canonical correlation analysis and principal component analysis. Like principal component analysis, CA solutions can be rotated orthogonally as well as obliquely into a simple structure without affecting the total amount of explained inertia. However, some specific aspects of CA prevent standard rotation procedures from being applied in a straightforward fashion. In particular, the role played by weights assigned to points and dimensions and the duality of CA solutions are unique to CA. For orthogonal simple structure rotation, procedures recently have been proposed. In this paper, we construct oblique rotation methods for CA that take into account these specific difficulties. We illustrate the benefits of our oblique rotation procedure by means of two illustrative examples.",,"ANALYTIC ROTATION,SIMPLICITY,MATRICES,INDEX","Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Psychol, Tarragona 43007, Spain::van de Velden, Michel@Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands::Kiers, Henk A.

Discriminating between strong and weak structures in three-mode principal component analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X369474,NOV 2009,22,24,"Recently, a number of model selection heuristics (i.e. DIFFIT, CORCONDIA, the numerical convex hull based heuristic) have been proposed for choosing among Parafac and/or Tucker3 solutions of different complexity for a given three-way three-mode data set. Such heuristics are often validated by means of extensive simulation studies. However, these simulation studies are unrealistic in that it is assumed that the variance in real three-way data can be split into two parts: structural variance, due to a true underlying Parafac or Tucker3 model of low complexity, and random noise. In this paper, we start from the much more reasonable assumption that the variance in any real three-way data set is due to three different sources: (1) a strong Parafac or Tucker3 structure of low complexity, accounting for a considerable amount of variance, (2) a weak Tucker3 structure, capturing less prominent data aspects, and (3) random noise. As such, Parafac and Tucker3 simulation studies are run in which the data are generated by adding a weak Tucker3 structure to a strong Parafac or Tucker3 one and perturbing the resulting data with random noise. The design of these studies is based on the reanalysis of real data sets. In these studies, the performance of the numerical convex hull based model selection method is evaluated with respect to its capability of discriminating strong from weak underlying structures. The results show that in about two-thirds of the simulated cases, the hull heuristic yields a model of the same complexity as the strong underlying structure and thus succeeds in disentangling strong and weak underlying structures. In the vast majority of the remaining third, this heuristic selects a solution that combines the strong structure and (part of) the weak structure.",,"INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES,MODELS,MATRICES,NUMBERS","Ceulemans, Eva@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Educ Sci, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Kiers, Henk A.

A Box-Cox normal model for response times,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X374126,NOV 2009,31,18,"The log-transform has been a convenient choice in response time modelling on test items. However, motivated by a dataset of the Medical College Admission Test where the lognormal model violated the normality assumption, the possibilities of the broader class of Box-Cox transformations for response time modelling are investigated. After an introduction and an outline of a broader framework for analysing responses and response times simultaneously, the performance of a Box-Cox normal model for describing response times is investigated using simulation studies and a real data example. A transformation-invariant implementation of the deviance information criterium (DIC) is developed that allows for comparing model fit between models with different transformation parameters. Showing an enhanced description of the shape of the response time distributions, its application in an educational measurement context is discussed at length.",,"DISTRIBUTIONS,TRANSFORMATIONS,SPEEDEDNESS,FRAMEWORK,MEMORY","Entink, R.

A graded response model for measuring person reliability,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X377745,NOV 2009,54,10,"This paper extends Lumsden's fluctuation model to the graded response case and, from the resulting basic scaling model, develops a one-dimensional item response theory graded response model (GRM). Under some additional assumptions, it follows that the item category response functions (ICRFs) can be closely approximated by the ICRFs of the standard GRM with equal item discrimination. For fixed item locations, the item responses depend on two individual differences parameters: the person central location and the person reliability. Procedures for estimating the person parameters and for addressing the goodness of fit of the proposed model as compared to the standard GRM are discussed. The accuracy of the person estimates is assessed by means of simulation studies. Finally, all the developments are illustrated using three empirical examples in personality measurement.",,"SELF-SCHEMATA,TEST SCORE,FLUCTUATION,INFORMATION,METATRAITS,VALIDITY,SCALES,TESTS","Joan Ferrando, Pere@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Fac Psicol, Tarragona 43007, Spain","Joan Ferrando, Pere@Universitat Rovira i Virgili","Ferrando, Pere@J-9857-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3133-5466","no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS+1972::Relationships between the thurstone and Rasch approaches to item scaling+Andrich, D.+Applied Psychological Measurement+1978::Individual response spread in self-report scales: Personality correlations and consequences+Austin, EJ; Deary, IJ; Gibson, GJ; et al.+PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES+MAR 1998::no title+Baker, F.+Item response theory: parameter estimation techniques+1992::METATRAITS+BAUMEISTER, RF; TICE, DM+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY+SEP 1988::ADAPTIVE EAP ESTIMATION OF ABILITY IN A MICROCOMPUTER ENVIRONMENT+BOCK, RD; MISLEVY, RJ+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+1982::THE NEXT GENERATION OF MODERATOR RESEARCH IN PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY+CHAPLIN, WF+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY+JUN 1991::SOME HYPOTHESES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF QUALITATIVE VARIABLES+COOMBS, CH+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+1948::no title+COOMBS CH+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1948::THE TEST-RETEST INDEX AND HIGH F MMPI PROFILES+EVANS, RG+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1984::A Pearson-type-VII item response model for assessing person fluctuation+Ferrando, Pere J.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2007::Person reliability in personality measurement: An item response theory analysis+Ferrando, PJ+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 2004::no title+Fisher, R.A.+Statistical Methods for Research Workers+1925::INTRA-INDIVIDUAL RESPONSE VARIABILITY+FISKE, DW; RICE, L+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1955::no title+FISKE DW+SOCIAL COGNITION+1984::The reliability of reliability: The generality and correlates of intra-individual consistency in responses to structured personality inventories+Goldberg, L.

"The metric-frequency measure of similarity for ill-structured data sets, with an application to family therapy",BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X376070,NOV 2009,42,7,"Similarity measures have been studied extensively in many domains, but usually with well-structured data sets. In many psychological applications, however, such data sets are not available. It often cannot even be predicted how many items will be observed, or what exactly they will entail. This paper introduces a similarity measure, called the metric-frequency (MF) measure, that can be applied to such data sets. If it is not known beforehand how many items will be observed, then the number of items actually observed in itself carries information. A typical feature of the MF is that it incorporates such information. The primary purpose of our measure is that it should be pragmatic, widely applicable, and tractable, even if data are complex. The MF generalizes Tversky's set-theoretic measure of similarity to cases where items may be present or absent and at the same time can be numerical as with Shepard's metric measure, but need not be so. As an illustration, we apply the MF to family therapy where it cannot be predicted what issues the clients will raise in therapy sessions. The MF is flexible enough to be applicable to idiographic data.",,"SEMANTIC SIMILARITY,JUDGMENT,TREES","Sales, Celia M.

Representing time-varying cyclic dynamics using multiple-subject state-space models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X384080,NOV 2009,60,15,"Over the last few decades, researchers have become increasingly aware of the need to consider intraindividual variability in the form of cyclic processes. In this paper, we review two contemporary cyclic state-space models: Young and colleagues' dynamic harmonic regression model and Harvey and colleagues' stochastic cycle model. We further derive the analytic equivalence between the two models, discuss their unique strengths and propose multiple-subject extensions. Using data from a study on human postural dynamics and a daily affect study, we demonstrate the use of these models to represent within-person non-stationarities in cyclic dynamics and interindividual differences therein. The use of diagnostic tools for evaluating model fit is also illustrated.",,"PANEL-DATA,KALMAN FILTER,SERIES MODELS,LIKELIHOOD,IDENTIFICATION,OSCILLATOR,ALGORITHM,POSTURE,SYSTEMS,MOOD","Chow, Sy-Miin@Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA::Hamaker, Ellen L.@Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands::Fujita, Frank@Indiana Univ, South Bend, IN 46615 USA::Boker, Steven M.@Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA","Chow, Sy-Miin@University of North Carolina@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill::Hamaker, Ellen L.@Utrecht University::Fujita, Frank@Indiana University South Bend@Indiana University System::Boker, Steven M.@University of Virginia",not exist,"no title+Anderson, B.

Overlooking its stochastic nature may lead to a serious underestimate of the sample size required to obtain an adequate probability of achieving the desired width for the confidence interval. The probability of achieving a certain width can either be an unconditional probability or a conditional probability given that the confidence interval includes the true parameter. We reconciled the difference between the unconditional and conditional probabilities by deriving the lower bound of the conditional probability. Additionally, we used the harmonic mean to determine unequal sample sizes for the confidence intervals for the two-mean comparison and multiple-mean comparisons.",,,"Liu, Xiaofeng Steven@Natl Educ Assoc, Washington, DC USA","Liu, Xiaofeng Steven@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.; Finlay, B.+Statistical methods for the social sciences+1997::SAMPLE-SIZE DETERMINATION FOR CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS ON THE POPULATION MEAN AND ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 2 POPULATION MEANS+BEAL, SL+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1989::no title+Bickel, PJ; Doksum, KA.+Mathematical Statistics: Basic Ideas and Selected Topics+1977::no title+Cochran, W.

Fixed-links models for investigating experimental effects combined with processing strategies in repeated measures designs: A cognitive task as example,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X268558,MAY 2009,34,11,Fixed-links models enable the investigation of experimental effects in combination with processing strategies in the framework of repeated measures designs. The consideration of different processing strategies is reasonable whenever the task requirements can be met in different ways. Effects due to specific processing strategies become obvious in comparing the models representing these processing strategies and also by investigating the variances of the corresponding latent variables. The usefulness of such models is demonstrated by the reaction time data of a cognitive task including three treatment levels. Two different processing strategies were considered: analytic and holistic. The results indicated that the participants applied both processing strategies. The analytic strategy was primarily applied for performing with respect to the second and third treatment levels and the holistic strategy with respect to the first treatment level.,,"FLUID INTELLIGENCE,RELIABILITY,GROWTH,TESTS,MEMORY,ERROR,ALPHA","Schweizer, Karl@Univ Frankfurt, Inst Psychol, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany","Schweizer, Karl@Goethe University Frankfurt",not exist,"Mood and the use of general knowledge structures in judgment and decision making+Bless, H; Igou, ER+ROUTINES OF DECISION MAKING+2005::An introduction to latent growth curve modeling+Duncan, TE; Duncan, SC+BEHAVIOR THERAPY+SPR 2004::Structural equation modeling [Computer Software]+Joreskog, K.

Improved Fisher z estimators for univariate random-effects meta-analysis of correlations,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X281633,MAY 2009,35,16,"Several authors have studied or used the following estimation strategy for meta-analysing correlations: obtain a point estimate or confidence interval for the mean Fisher z correlation, and transform this estimate to the Pearson r metric. Using the relationship between Fisher z and Pearson r random variables, I demonstrate the potential discrepancy induced by directly z-to-r transforming a mean correlation parameter. Point and interval estimators based on an alternative integral z-to-r transformation are proposed. Analytic expressions for the expectation and variance of certain meta-analytic point estimators are also provided, as are selected moments of correlation parameters; numerical examples are included. In an application of these analytic results, the proposed point estimator outperformed its usual direct z-to-r counterpart and compared favourably with an estimator based on Pearson r correlations. Practical implications, extensions of the proposed estimators, and uses for the analytic results are discussed.",,"RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS,VALIDITY GENERALIZATION,CORRELATION-COEFFICIENTS,SITUATIONAL SPECIFICITY,TESTS,POPULATION","Hafdahl, Adam R.@Washington Univ, Dept Math, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Hafdahl, Adam R.@Washington University (WUSTL)","Hafdahl, Adam@I-7738-2012","Multivariate meta-analysis+Becker, B.

Two modifications of the Games and Howell procedure were shown to make it conservative. No procedure was found to be uniformly most powerful. For any pair power the Games and Howell procedure was found to be generally most powerful even when applied at more stringent levels to control Type I errors.

Optimum sample size allocation to minimize cost or maximize power for the two-sample trimmed mean test,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X267289,MAY 2009,50,10,"When planning a study, sample size determination is one of the most important tasks facing the researcher. The size will depend on the purpose of the study, the cost limitations, and the nature of the data. By specifying the standard deviation ratio and/or the sample size ratio, the present study considers the problem of heterogeneous variances and non-normality for Yuen's two-group test and develops sample size formulas to minimize the total cost or maximize the power of the test. For a given power, the sample size allocation ratio can be manipulated so that the proposed formulas can minimize the total cost, the total sample size, or the sum of total sample size and total cost. On the other hand, for a given total cost, the optimum sample size allocation ratio can maximize the statistical power of the test. After the sample size is determined, the present simulation applies Yuen's test to the sample generated, and then the procedure is validated in terms of Type I errors and power. Simulation results show that the proposed formulas can control Type I errors and achieve the desired power under the various conditions specified. Finally, the implications for determining sample sizes in experimental studies and future research are discussed.",,"BEHRENS-FISHER PROBLEM,STATISTICAL POWER,POPULATION VARIANCES,UNEQUAL VARIANCES,MONTE-CARLO,TRANSFORMATION,ROBUSTNESS,HETEROGENEITY,DISTRIBUTIONS,NONNORMALITY","Guo, Jiin-Huarng@Natl Pingtung Univ Educ, Dept Appl Math, Pingtung, Taiwan::Luh, Wei-Ming@Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Educ, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Guo, Jiin-Huarng@Unknow::Luh, Wei-Ming@National Cheng Kung University","Rohlf, F@A-8710-2008","Sample size determination: A review+Adcock, CJ+STATISTICIAN+1997::Power and money: Designing statistically powerful studies while minimizing financial costs+Allison, DB; Allison, RL; Faith, MS; et al.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 1997::no title+Barnett, V.+Sample survey: Principles and methods.+1991::ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::The design of simulation studies in medical statistics+Burton, Andrea; Altman, Douglas G.; Royston, Patrick; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2006::Statistical power analysis+Cohen, J.+Current Directions in Psychological Science+1992::no title+Cohen, J.+Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences+1988::no title+Desu, M.

Bootstrap confidence intervals in multi-level simultaneous component analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X265894,MAY 2009,23,14,"Multi-level simultaneous component analysis (MLSCA) was designed for the exploratory analysis of hierarchically ordered data. MLSCA specifies a component model for each level in the data, where appropriate constraints express possible similarities between groups of objects at a certain level, yielding four MLSCA variants. The present paper discusses different bootstrap strategies for estimating confidence intervals (CIs) on the individual parameters. In selecting a proper strategy, the main issues to address are the resampling scheme and the non-uniqueness of the parameters. The resampling scheme depends on which level(s) in the hierarchy are considered random, and which fixed. The degree of non-uniqueness depends on the MLSCA variant, and, in two variants, the extent to which the user exploits the transformational freedom. A comparative simulation study examines the quality of bootstrap CIs of different MLSCA parameters. Generally, the quality of bootstrap CIs appears to be good, provided the sample sizes are sufficient at each level that is considered to be random. The latter implies that if more than a single level is considered random, the total number of observations necessary to obtain reliable inferential information increases dramatically. An empirical example illustrates the use of bootstrap CIs in MLSCA.",,"POPULATIONS,LOADINGS","Timmerman, Marieke E.@Univ Groningen, Heymans Inst Psychol, Groningen, Netherlands::Kiers, Henk A.

Acquiescent responding in partially balanced multidimensional scales,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X265164,MAY 2009,21,15,"We propose a method for controlling acquiescent response in which acquiescence response variance is isolated in an independent factor. This kind of procedure is available for perfectly balanced scales (i.e. half of the items are worded in the opposite direction to the other half with respect to a general trait). However, few questionnaires are designed so that exactly half of the items are worded in this way. If this is not the case, the available methods are useless. We propose to adapt the rotation method of Lorenzo-Seva and Rodriguez-Fornells to handle partially balanced scales (i.e. only a few items in the scale are worded in the opposite direction). The most important characteristic of our method is that it removes the variance due to acquiescent response from all the items in the questionnaire (i.e. the balanced subset of items, but also the unbalanced subsets of items). The usefulness of the method is illustrated in a numerical example.",,"BIAS,ADJUSTMENT,STYLES,INDEX","Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Psychol, Fac Psychol, Res Ctr Behav Assessment, Tarragona 43007, Spain::Ferrando, Pere J.@Unknow","Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@Universitat Rovira i Virgili::Ferrando, Pere J.@Unknow","Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@G-4228-2011::Ferrando, Pere@J-9857-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3133-5466::lorenzo-seva, Urbano@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5369-3099","Response styles in marketing research: A cross-national investigation+Baumgartner, H; Steenkamp, JBEM+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+MAY 2001::IDENTIFICATION OF CONTENT AND STYLE - 2-DIMENSIONAL INTERPRETATION OF ACQUIESCENCE+BENTLER, PM; JACKSON, DN; MESSICK, S+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1971::Modeling Acquiescence in Measurement Models for Two Balanced Sets of Items+Billiet, Jaak B.; McClendon, Mckee J.+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+2000::Assessing extreme and acquiescence response sets in cross-cultural research using structural equations modeling+Cheung, GW; Rensvold, RB+JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAR 2000::USING BALANCED SCALES TO CONTROL ACQUIESCENCE+CLOUD, J; VAUGHAN, GM+SOCIOMETRY+1970::Studies of acquiescence as a factor in the true-false test+Cronbach, LJ+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY+1942::Unrestricted factor analytic procedures for assessing acquiescent responding in balanced, theoretically unidimensional personality scales+Ferrando, PJ; Lorenzo-Seva, U; Chico, E+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+2003::IMPROVING RATING-SCALE MEASURES BY DETECTING AND CORRECTING BIAS COMPONENTS IN SOME RESPONSE STYLES+GREENLEAF, EA+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+MAY 1992::no title+HOFSTEE WKB+Z DIFFERENTIELLE DIA+1994::THE VARIMAX CRITERION FOR ANALYTIC ROTATION IN FACTOR-ANALYSIS+KAISER, HF+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1958::PROCRUSTES MATCHING BY CONGRUENCE COEFFICIENTS+KORTH, B; TUCKER, LR+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1976::A factor simplicity index+Lorenzo-Seva, U+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2003::Acquiescent responding in balanced multidimensional scales and exploratory factor analysis+Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano; Rodriguez-Fornells, Antoni+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2006::ELIMINATING DEFENSE AND AGREEMENT BIAS FROM MEASURES OF THE SENSE OF CONTROL - A 2X2 INDEX+MIROWSKY, J; ROSS, CE+SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY+JUN 1991::Facts and artefacts in the comparison of attitudes among ethnic minorities.

Most notably, multiobjective programming provides a tool for analysts to model trade offs among competing criteria in clustering, seriation, and unidimensional scaling tasks. Although multiobjective programming has considerable promise, the technique can produce numerically appealing results that lack empirical validity.

Compared with the weighted deviation modelling method, it leads to fewer constraint violations and better exposure control while maintaining the same level of measurement precision.",,"EXPOSURE,MODEL","Cheng, Ying@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA::Chang, Hua-Hua@Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Cheng, Ying@University of Notre Dame::Chang, Hua-Hua@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign",not exist,"IRT test assembly using network-flow programming+Armstrong, RD; Jones, DH+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1998::Optimal Design in Educational Testing+Buyske, Steven+APPLIED OPTIMAL DESIGNS+2005::a-stratified multistage computerized adaptive testing with b blocking+Chang, HH; Qian, JH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 2001::a-stratified multistage computerized adaptive testing+Chang, HH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1999::A global information approach to computerized adoptive testing+Chang, HH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1996::Linear models for optimal test design+Chang, Hua-Hua+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2007::The relationship between item exposure and test overlap in computerized adaptive testing+Chen, SY; Ankenmann, RD; Spray, JA+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SUM 2003::no title+CHENG Y+ANN M NAT COUNC MEAS+2006::Two-phase item selection procedure for flexible content balancing in CAT+Cheng, Ying; Chang, Hua-Hua+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+NOV 2007::New algorithms for item selection and exposure control with computerized adaptive testing+Davey, T; Parshall, CG.+ANN M AM ED RES ASS+1995::no title+HAMBLETON R+PREFACE LINEAR MODEL+2005::no title+Hambleton,, R.

An effect size index for comparing two independent alpha coefficients,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X315518,MAY 2009,33,8,"Since Cronbach proposed the a coefficient in 1951, researchers have contributed to the derivation of its sampling distribution and the testing of related statistical hypotheses. Yet, there has been no research on effect size index relevant to coefficient a to our knowledge. Considering the importance of effect size in understanding quantitative research findings, we therefore developed an effect size index Delta for the comparison of two independent as with equal test length based on the asymptotic distribution of (1/2) In (1-(alpha) over cap) under the assumptions of normality and compound symmetry. Simulations indicated that the index was applicable when the sample size was at least 100. The robustness of the derived index when the required assumptions were violated was also explored. It is suggested that the index should be applicable in most cases of unequal test lengths and could be extended to non-normally distributed component scores. Moreover, a small simulation was conducted to explore the behaviour of Delta with correlated errors, a frequently studied situation violating the assumption of compound symmetry. The proposed index was found to be robust unless a large number of highly correlated errors were present in the data.",,"RELIABILITY COEFFICIENT,CRONBACHS ALPHA,EQUALITY,TESTS,SAMPLE,HYPOTHESIS,PSYCHOLOGY,VIOLATION","Liu, Hsin-Yun@Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Psychol, Taipei 106, Taiwan::Weng, Li-Jen@Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Psychol, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Liu, Hsin-Yun@National Taiwan University::Weng, Li-Jen@National Taiwan University","WENG, LI-JEN@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5822-4029","no title+Allen, M.

Latent variable models for multivariate longitudinal ordinal responses,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X320134,MAY 2009,19,17,The paper proposes a full information maximum likelihood estimation method for modelling multivariate longitudinal ordinal variables. Two latent variable models are proposed that account for dependencies among items within time and between time. One model fits item-specific random effects which account for the between time points correlations and the second model uses a common factor. The relationships between the time-dependent latent variables are modelled with a non-stationary autoregressive model. The proposed models are fitted to a real data set.,,"COMPONENTS,VARIANCE,COMMON","Cagnone, Silvia@Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy::Moustaki, Irini@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England::Vasdekis, Vassilis@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece","Cagnone, Silvia@University of Bologna::Moustaki, Irini@University of London@London School Economics & Political Science::Vasdekis, Vassilis@Athens University of Economics & Business",not exist,"Item response theory for longitudinal data: population parameter estimation+Andrade, DF; Tavares, HR+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 2005::Latent Curve Models: A Structural Equation Perspective+Bollen, KA; Curran, PJ+LATENT CURVE MODELS: A STRUCTURAL EQUATION PERSPECTIVE+2006::no title+Browne, M.

On sample size calculation for 2 x 2 fixed-effect ANOVA when variances are unknown and possibly unequal,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X322853,MAY 2009,38,2,"The factorial 2 x 2 fixed-effect ANOVA is a procedure used frequently in scientific research to test mean differences between-subjects in all of the groups. But if the assumption of homogeneity is violated, the test for the row, column, and the interaction effect might be invalid or less powerful. Therefore, for planning research in the case of unknown and possibly unequal variances, it is worth developing a sample size formula to obtain the desired power. This article suggests a simple formula to determine the sample size for 2 x 2 fixed-effect ANOVA for heterogeneous variances across groups. We use the approximate Welch t test and consider the variance ratio to derive the formula. The sample size determination requires two-step iterations but the approximate sample sizes needed for the main effect and the interaction effect can be determined separately with the specified power. The present study also provides an example and a SAS program to facilitate the calculation process.",,"STATISTICAL POWER,DESIGNS,DETECT,PSYCHOTHERAPY,RESEARCHERS,HYPOTHESES,CONTRAST,ANCOVA","Guo, Jiin-Huarng@Natl Pingtung Univ Educ, Dept Appl Math, Pingtung, Taiwan::Luh, Wei-Ming@Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Educ, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Guo, Jiin-Huarng@Unknow::Luh, Wei-Ming@National Cheng Kung University",not exist,"Contrast tests of interaction hypotheses+Abelson, RP; Prentice, DA+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 1997::Conducting power analyses for ANOVA and ancova in between-subjects designs+Algina, J; Olejnik, S+EVALUATION &amp; THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS+SEP 2003::Publication manual of the American Psychological Association+no author+PUBL MAN AM PSYCH AS+2001::no title+Bausell, R.

Robust ANCOVA using a smoother with bootstrap bagging,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X325300,MAY 2009,39,6,"Many robust analogs of the classic analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method have been proposed, some of which are based on some type of regression smoother. A method that first appeared in this journal, which is relatively simple and performs well in simulations, is based on a running interval smoother combined with comparing medians or 20% trimmed means. It makes no parametric assumption about the regression lines and does not assume that the regression lines are parallel. A possible way of improving the efficiency of the running interval smoother is to use bootstrap bagging and a minor goal here is to report some results supporting this approach. The major goal is to consider how ANCOVA might be performed when bootstrap bagging is used. Simple extensions of extant approaches that use some type of bootstrap method were found to be unsatisfactory. However, a basic percentile bootstrap method was found to perform well in simulations. And a reanalysis of data dealing with teachers' expectations about the cognitive ability of students illustrates that bootstrap bagging can make a practical difference.",,"REGRESSION-CURVES,NONPARAMETRIC ANALYSIS,COVARIANCE,SELECTION","Wilcox, Rand R.@Univ So Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Wilcox, Rand R.@University of Southern California","Wilcox, Rand@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2524-2976","ROBUSTNESS OF COVARIANCE ANALYSIS OF 1-WAY CLASSIFICATION+ATIQULLAH, M+BIOMETRIKA+1964::no title+BOWMAN A+APPL STAT-J ROY ST C+1996::Heuristics of instability and stabilization in model selection+Breiman, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1996::Bagging predictors+Breiman, L+MACHINE LEARNING+AUG 1996::Analyzing bagging+Buhlmann, P; Yu, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2002::ROBUST LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION AND SMOOTHING SCATTERPLOTS+CLEVELAND, WS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::Recent developments in bootstrap methodology+Davison, AC; Hinkley, DV; Young, GA+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2003::TESTING THE EQUALITY OF NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION-CURVES+DELGADO, MA+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 18 1993::Nonparametric analysis of covariance+Dette, H; Neumeyer, N+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2001::no title+Efromovich, S.+Nonparametric curve estimation: Methods, theory and applications+1999::no title+Efron, B.; Tibshirani, R.

Coherent psychometric modelling with Bayesian nonparametrics,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X246237,FEB 2009,34,8,"In this paper we argue that model selection, as commonly practised in psychometrics, violates certain principles of coherence. On the other hand, we show that Bayesian nonparametrics provides a coherent basis for model selection, through the use of a 'nonparametric' prior distribution that has a large support on the space of sampling distributions. We illustrate model selection under the Bayesian nonparametric approach, through the analysis of real questionnaire data. Also, we present ways to use the Bayesian nonparametric framework to define very flexible psychometric models, through the specification of a nonparametric prior distribution that supports all distribution functions for the inverse link, including the standard logistic distribution functions. The Bayesian nonparametric approach provides a coherent method for model selection that can be applied to any statistical model, including psychometric models. Moreover, under a 'non-informative' choice of nonparametric prior, the Bayesian nonparametric approach is easy to apply, and selects the model that maximizes the log likelihood. Thus, under this choice of prior, the approach can be extended to non-Bayesian settings where the parameters of the competing models are estimated by likelihood maximization, and it can be used with any psychometric software package that routinely reports the model log likelihood.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,EM ALGORITHM,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE","Karabatsos, George@Univ Illinois, Coll Educ, Chicago, IL 60607 USA::Walker, Stephen G.@Univ Kent, Inst Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury, Kent, England","Karabatsos, George@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Chicago@University of Illinois Chicago Hospital::Walker, Stephen G.@University of Kent",not exist,"Information theory and the maximum likelihood principle+AKAIKE, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::no title+ANDERSEN E+CONDITIONAL INFERENC+1973::What Georg Rasch Would Have Thought About This Book+Andersen, E.

Improved statistics for contrasting means of two samples under non-normality,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X246246,FEB 2009,24,4,"This paper presents the asymptotic expansions of the distributions of the two-sample t-statistic and the Welch statistic, for testing the equality of the means of two independent populations under non-normality. Unlike other approaches, we obtain the null distributions in terms of the distribution and density functions of the standard normal variable up to n(-1), where n is the pooled sample size. Based on these expansions, monotone transformations are employed to remove the higher-order cumulant effect. We show that the new statistics can improve the precision of statistical inference to the level of o (n(-1)).

The psychometricians' fallacy: Too clever by half?,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X243582,FEB 2009,59,24,"The psychometricians' fallacy concludes that an attribute is quantitative from the premise that it is ordinal. This fallacy occupies a central place in the paradigm of psychometrics. Most of the founders of the discipline committed it and it makes sense of otherwise anomalous developments within the discipline, such as the permissible statistics controversy and the dominant form taken by item response theories. The fallacy is displayed by showing (1) that an attribute's quantitative structure reduces to a weak order upon differences between degrees that satisfies the double cancellation, solvability, and Archimedean conditions of conjoint measurement theory and (2) the fact that any order on the degrees themselves does not entail sufficient structure on this weak order to guarantee satisfaction of these conditions. Thus, it is possible that an ordered attribute is non-quantitative. Also, each pair of differences between degrees of an ordinal attribute falls into one of two disjoint classes: (1) those where the order relation between the pair follows from an order on the attribute and (2) those where it is independent of that order and possibly diagnostic of quantitative structure and this fact means that the distinction between order and quantity is an empirical one.",,"PARAMETRIC STATISTICS,CONJOINT-MEASUREMENT,MODELS,ERROR","Michell, Joel@Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Michell, Joel@University of Sydney",not exist,"no title+BERGSON H+TIME FREE WILL+1913::The logic of the normal law of error in mental measurement+Boring, EG+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY+1920::What do we mean by the intensity of psychical states?+Bradley, F.

Heteroscedastic one-factor models and marginal maximum likelihood estimation,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X248884,FEB 2009,26,17,"In the present paper, a general class of heteroscedastic one-factor models is considered. In these models, the residual variances of the observed scores are explicitly modelled as parametric functions of the one-dimensional factor score. A marginal maximum likelihood procedure for parameter estimation is proposed under both the assumption of multivariate normality of the observed scores conditional on the single common factor score and the assumption of normality of the common factor score. A likelihood ratio test is derived, which can be used to test the usual homoscedastic one-factor model against one of the proposed heteroscedastic models. Simulation studies are carried out to investigate the robustness and the power of this likelihood ratio test. Results show that the asymptotic properties of the test statistic hold under both small test length conditions and small sample size conditions. Results also show under what conditions the power to detect different heteroscedasticity parameter values is either small, medium, or large. Finally, for illustrative purposes, the marginal maximum likelihood estimation procedure and the likelihood ratio test are applied to real data.",,TESTS,"Hessen, David J.@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands::Dolan, Conor V.@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Hessen, David J.@Utrecht University::Dolan, Conor V.@University of Amsterdam",not exist,"MARGINAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF ITEM PARAMETERS - APPLICATION OF AN EM ALGORITHM+BOCK, RD; AITKIN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1981::FITTING A RESPONSE MODEL FOR N DICHOTOMOUSLY SCORED ITEMS+BOCK, RD; LIEBERMAN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1970::no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::A Limited-Information Estimator for LISREL Models with or Without Heteroscedastic Errors+Bollen, Kenneth A.+&lt;IT&gt;Advanced Structural Equation Modeling: Issues and Techniques&lt;/IT&gt;+1996::THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO, WALD, AND LAGRANGE MULTIPLIER TESTS - AN EXPOSITORY NOTE+BUSE, A+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1982::Intelligence and the differentiation hypothesis+Deary, IJ; Egan, V; Gibson, GJ; et al.+INTELLIGENCE+SEP-OCT 1996::CORRELATIONS OF MENTAL TESTS WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH COGNITIVE VARIABLES ARE HIGHEST FOR LOW IQ GROUPS+DETTERMAN, DK; DANIEL, MH+INTELLIGENCE+OCT-DEC 1989::ESTIMATING REGRESSION-MODELS WITH MULTIPLICATIVE HETEROSCEDASTICITY+HARVEY, AC+ECONOMETRICA+1976::A GENERAL APPROACH TO CONFIRMATORY MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FACTOR ANALYSIS+JORESKOG, KG+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1969::SOME CONTRIBUTIONS TO MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FACTOR ANALYSIS+JORESKOG, KG+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1967::The estimation of factor loadings by the method of maximum likelihood+Lawley, D.+P ROY SOC EDINB A+1940::THE APPLICATION OF THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD METHOD TO FACTOR ANALYSIS+Lawley, D.

A new statistical approach based on classical test theory is proposed to assess when subscores at the institutional level have any added value over the total scores. The methods are applied to two operational data sets. For the data under study, the observed results provide little support in favour of reporting subscores for either examinees or institutions.",,,"Haberman, Shelby@Unknow::Sinharay, Sandip@Educ Testing Serv, Ctr Stat Theory & Practice, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA::Puhan, Gautam@Unknow","Haberman, Shelby@Unknow::Sinharay, Sandip@Educational Testing Service (ETS)::Puhan, Gautam@Unknow","Sinharay, Sandip@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4491-8510","no title+Bock, R.

Fixed-versus random-effects models in meta-analysis: Model properties and an empirical comparison of differences in results,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X255327,FEB 2009,60,252,"Today most conclusions about cumulative knowledge in psychology are based on meta-analysis. We first present an examination of the important statistical differences between fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) models in meta-analysis and between two different RE procedures, due to Hedges and Vevea, and to Hunter and Schmidt. The implications of these differences for the appropriate interpretation of published meta-analyses are explored by applying the two RE procedures to 68 meta-analyses from five large meta-analytic studies previously published in Psychological Bulletin. Under the assumption that the goal of research is generalizable knowledge, results indicated that the published FE confidence intervals (CIs) around mean effect sizes were on average 52% narrower than their actual width, with similar results being produced by the two RE procedures. These nominal 95% FE CIs were found to be on average 56% CIs. Because most meta-analyses in the literature use FE models, these findings suggest that the precision of meta-analysis findings in the literature has often been substantially overstated, with important consequences for research and practice.",,"CUMULATIVE RESEARCH KNOWLEDGE,VALIDITY GENERALIZATION,GENDER-DIFFERENCES,CORRELATION-COEFFICIENTS,SITUATIONAL SPECIFICITY,META-ANALYSIS,EFFECT SIZES,RESEARCHERS,ERROR,TESTS","Schmidt, Frank L.@Univ Iowa, Dept Management & Org, Henry B Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA::Oh, In-Sue@Unknow::Hayes, Theodore L.@Gallup Org Inc, Washington, DC USA","Schmidt, Frank L.@University of Iowa::Oh, In-Sue@Unknow::Hayes, Theodore L.@Unknow","Oh, In-Sue@S-7306-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3298-2489","Publication manual of the American Psychological Association+no author+PUBL MAN AM PSYCH AS+2001::no title+Aronson, E.; Carlsmith, J.

Estimation of maximal reliability for multiple-component instruments in multilevel designs,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X255345,FEB 2009,35,8,A procedure for point and interval estimation of maximal reliability of multiple-component measuring instruments in multi-level settings is outlined. The approach is applicable to hierarchical designs in which individuals are nested within higher-order units and exhibit possibly related performance on components of a given homogeneous scale. The method is developed within the framework of multi-level factor analysis. The proposed procedure is illustrated with an empirical example.,,"COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,MODEL","Raykov, Tenko@Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA::Penev, Spiridon@Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Raykov, Tenko@Michigan State University::Penev, Spiridon@University of New South Wales Sydney","Penev, Spiridon@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3669-0010","no title+Bartholomew, D.

MCMC estimation for the p(2) network regression model with crossed random effects,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X255336,FEB 2009,27,6,"The p(2) model is a statistical model for the analysis of binary relational data with covariates, as occur in social network studies. It can be characterized as a multinomial regression model with crossed random effects that reflect actor heterogeneity and dependence between the ties from and to the same actor in the network. Three Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation methods for the p2 model are presented to improve iterative generalized least squares (IGLS) estimation developed earlier, two of which use random walk proposals. The third method, an independence chain sampler, and one of the random walk algorithms use normal approximations of the binary network data to generate proposals in the MCMC algorithms. A large-scale simulation study compares MCMC estimates with IGLS estimates for networks with 20 and 40 actors. It was found that the IGLS estimates have a smaller variance but are severely biased, while the MCMC estimates have a larger variance with a small bias. For networks with 20 actors, mean squared errors are generally comparable or smaller for the IGLS estimates. For networks with 40 actors, mean squared errors are the smallest for the MCMC estimates. Coverage rates of confidence intervals are good for the MCMC estimates but not for the IGLS estimates.",,"MULTILEVEL MODELS,DIRECTED-GRAPHS,LAPLACE APPROXIMATION,BINARY RESPONSES,DISTRIBUTIONS","Zijlstra, Bonne J.

Nearly unbiased estimators for the three-parameter Weibull distribution with greater efficiency than the iterative likelihood method,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X270843,FEB 2009,38,12,"The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method is the most commonly used method to estimate the parameters of the three-parameter Weibull distribution. However, it returns biased estimates. In this paper, we show how to calculate weights which cancel the biases contained in the MLE equations. The exact weights can be computed when the population parameters are known and the expected weights when they are not. Two of the three weights' expected values are dependent only on the sample size, whereas the third also depends on the population shape parameters. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the practicability of the weighted MLE method. When compared with the iterative MLE technique, the bias is reduced by a factor of 7 (irrespective of the sample size) and the variability of the parameter estimates is also reduced by a factor of 7 for very small sample sizes, but this gain disappears for large sample sizes.",,"RESPONSE-TIME DISTRIBUTIONS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,RACE MODELS","Cousineau, Denis@Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada","Cousineau, Denis@University of Montreal","cousineau, denis@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5908-0402","EVIDENCE FROM AUDITORY SIMPLE REACTION-TIMES FOR BOTH CHANGE AND LEVEL DETECTORS+BURBECK, SL+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+1982::GENERALIZATION OF THE METHOD OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD+CACCIARI, M; MONTANARI, GC; MAZZANTI, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DIELECTRICS AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION+JUN 1994::ESTIMATING PARAMETERS IN CONTINUOUS UNIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS WITH A SHIFTED ORIGIN+CHENG, RCH; AMIN, NAK+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1983::Fitting distributions using maximum likelihood: Methods and packages+Cousineau, D; Brown, S; Heathcote, A+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS INSTRUMENTS &amp; COMPUTERS+NOV 2004::PASTIS: A program for curve and distribution analyses+Cousineau, D; Larochelle, S+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS INSTRUMENTS &amp; COMPUTERS+NOV 1997::no title+COUSINEAU D+IEEE T DIEL IN PRESS+no time::no title+COUSINEAU D+IMPROVING MAXI UNPUB+2008::Extending statistics of extremes to distributions varying in position and scale and the implications for race models+Cousineau, D; Goodman, VW; Shiffrin, RM+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+AUG 2002::Merging race models and adaptive networks: A parallel race network+Cousineau, D+PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN &amp; REVIEW+OCT 2004::Termination of a visual search with large display size effects+Cousineau, D; Shiffrin, RM+SPATIAL VISION+2004::no title+Dolan, C.+DISFIT version 1. 0: Provisional program documentation+2000::ESTIMATING THE CUMULATIVE PROBABILITY OF FAILURE DATA POINTS TO BE PLOTTED ON WEIBULL AND OTHER PROBABILITY PAPER+FOTHERGILL, JC+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL INSULATION+JUN 1990::no title+Galambos, J.+The Asymptotic Theory of Extreme Order Statistics+1978::no title+Gumbel, EJ.+Statistics of extremes+1958::no title+HACCOUN RR+STAT CONCEPTS APPL+2007::QMPE: Estimating lognormal, wald, and Weibull RT distributions with a parameter-dependent lower bound+Heathcote, A; Brown, S; Cousineau, D+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS INSTRUMENTS &amp; COMPUTERS+MAY 2004::RTSYS: A DOS application for the analysis of reaction time data+Heathcote, A+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS INSTRUMENTS &amp; COMPUTERS+AUG 1996::Bias correction for the maximum likelihood estimates in the two-parameter Weibull distribution+Hirose, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DIELECTRICS AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION+FEB 1999::ULTRASTABLE STIMULUS-RESPONSE LATENCIES - ACQUISITION AND STIMULUS-CONTROL+HOPKINS, GW; KRISTOFFERSON, AB+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+1980::Inference of sampling on Weibull parameter estimation (vol 3, pg 809, 1996)+Jacquelin, J+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DIELECTRICS AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION+FEB 1997::GENERALIZATION OF THE METHOD OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD+JACQUELIN, J+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL INSULATION+FEB 1993::no title+KIEFER NM+MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD E+2006::TOWARD AN INSTANCE THEORY OF AUTOMATIZATION+LOGAN, GD+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+OCT 1988::no title+Luce, RD.+Response times: their role in inferring elementary mental organization+1986::Tutorial on maximum likelihood estimation+Myung, IJ+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 2003::no title+PALMER J+VISUAL ATTENTION+1998::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION WITH WEIBULL MODEL+ROCKETTE, H; ANTLE, C; KLIMKO, LA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::Symbolic maximum likelihood estimation with Mathematica+Rose, C; Smith, MD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN+2000::no title+Rose, C.; Smith, M.+Mathematical Statistics with Mathematica+2001::A hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework for response time distributions+Rouder, JN; Sun, DC; Speckman, PL; et al.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2003::A hierarchical model for estimating response time distributions+Rouder, JN; Lu, J; Speckman, P; et al.+PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN &amp; REVIEW+APR 2005::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION IN A CLASS OF NONREGULAR CASES+SMITH, RL+BIOMETRIKA+1985::A comment on Heathcote, Brown, and Mewhort's QMLE method for response time distributions+Speckman, PL; Rouder, JN+PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN &amp; REVIEW+JUN 2004::no title+Townsend, J.

A comparative study of robust tests for spread: Asymmetric trimming strategies,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711008X299742,NOV 2008,41,8,"We examined 633 procedures that can be used to compare the variability of scores across independent groups. The procedures, except for one, were modifications of the procedures suggested by Levene (1960) and O'Brien (1981). We modified their procedures by substituting robust measures of the typical score and variability, rather than relying on classical estimators. The robust measures that we utilized were either based on a priori or empirically determined symmetric or asymmetric trimming strategies. The Levene-type and O'Brien-type transformed scores were used with either the ANOVA F test, a robust test due to Lee and Fung (1985), or the Welch (1951) test. Based on four measures of robustness, we recommend a Levene-type transformation based upon empirically determined 20% asymmetric trimmed means, involving a particular adaptive estimator, where the transformed scores are then used with the ANOVA F test.",,"ONE-WAY ANOVA,I ERROR RATES,VARIANCES,ESTIMATORS,SCALE,DISTRIBUTIONS,HOMOGENEITY,STATISTICS","Keselman, H.

Stability analysis in K-means clustering,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X184849,NOV 2008,57,22,"This paper develops a new procedure, called stability analysis, for K-means clustering. Instead of ignoring local optima and only considering the best solution found, this procedure takes advantage of additional information from a K-means cluster analysis. The information from the locally optimal solutions is collected in an object by object co-occurrence matrix. The co-occurrence matrix is clustered and subsequently reordered by a steepest ascent quadratic assignment procedure to aid visual interpretation of the multidimensional cluster structure. Subsequently, measures are developed to determine the overall structure of a data set, the number of clusters and the multidimensional relationships between the clusters.",,"CHARACTER STABILITY,LOCAL OPTIMA,DATA SET,CONSENSUS,NUMBER,ALGORITHM","Steinley, Douglas@Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Steinley, Douglas@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"CONSENSUS TECHNIQUES AND COMPARISON OF TAXONOMIC TREES+ADAMS, EN+SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY+1972::no title+Anderberg, Michael R.+Cluster Analysis For Applications+1973::Cluster analysis and marketing research+Arabie, P.; Hubert, L.+Advanced Methods in Marketing Research+1994::COMBINATORIAL DATA-ANALYSIS+ARABIE, P; HUBERT, LJ+ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY+1992::An overview of combinatorial data analysis+Arabie, P.; Hubert, L.+Clustering and Classification+1996::Speech analysis by clustering, or the hyperphoneme method+Astrahan, M.

Alpha if item deleted: A note on loss of criterion validity in scale development if maximizing coefficient alpha,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X188520,NOV 2008,16,17,"This note is concerned with a validity-related limitation of the widely available and routinely used index 'alpha if item deleted' in the process of construction and development of multiple-component measuring instruments. Attention is drawn to the fact that this statistic can suggest dispensing with such scale components, whose removal leads to loss of criterion validity while maximizing the popular coefficient alpha. As an alternative, a latent variable modelling approach is discussed that can be used for point and interval estimation of composite criterion validity (as well as reliability) after deletion of single components. The method can also be utilized to test conventional or minimum level hypotheses about associated population change in measurement quality indices.",,"RELIABILITY,TESTS","Raykov, Tenko@Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Raykov, Tenko@Michigan State University",not exist,"no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::no title+Crocker, L.; Algina, J.+Introduction to classical and modern test theory+1986::no title+CRONBACH LJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1951::no title+Hays, W.

A general diagnostic model applied to language testing data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X193957,NOV 2008,30,81,"Probabilistic models with one or more latent variables are designed to report on a corresponding number of skills or cognitive attributes. Multidimensional skill profiles offer additional information beyond what a single test score can provide, if the reported skills can be identified and distinguished reliably. Many recent approaches to skill profile models are limited to dichotomous data and have made use of computationally intensive estimation methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, since standard maximum likelihood (ML) estimation techniques were deemed infeasible. This paper presents a general diagnostic model (GDM) that can be estimated with standard ML techniques and applies to polytomous response variables as well as to skills with two or more proficiency levels. The paper uses one member of a larger class of diagnostic models, a compensatory diagnostic model for dichotomous and partial credit data. Many well-known models, such as univariate and multivariate versions of the Rasch model and the two-parameter logistic item response theory model, the generalized partial credit model, as well as a variety of skill profile models, are special cases of this GDM. In addition to an introduction to this model, the paper presents a parameter recovery study using simulated data and an application to real data from the field test for TOEFL (R) Internet-based testing.",,"PARTIAL-CREDIT MODEL,ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,LATENT CLASS MODELS","von Davier, Matthias@Educ Testing Serv, Res & Dev, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA","von Davier, Matthias@Educational Testing Service (ETS)",not exist,"Graphical models and computerized adaptive testing+Almond, RG; Mislevy, RJ+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1999::Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::no title+COHEN J+EDUC PSYCHOL MEAS+1960::Higher-order latent trait models for cognitive diagnosis+De la Torre, J; Douglas, JA+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 2004::no title+Fleiss, J.+Statistical methods for rates and proportions+1981::no title+HABERMAN SJ+QUALITATIVE DATA ANA+1979::USING RESTRICTED LATENT CLASS MODELS TO MAP THE SKILL STRUCTURE OF ACHIEVEMENT ITEMS+HAERTEL, EH+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+WIN 1989::no title+Hagenaars, J.

SEM of another flavour: Two new applications of the supplemented EM algorithm,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X249603,NOV 2008,49,49,"The supplemented EM (SEM) algorithm is applied to address two goodness-of-fit testing problems in psychometrics. The first problem involves computing the information matrix for item parameters in item response theory models. This matrix is important for limited-information goodness-of-fit testing and it is also used to compute standard errors for the item parameter estimates. For the second problem, it is shown that the SEM algorithm provides a convenient computational procedure that leads to an asymptotically chi-squared goodness-of-fit statistic for the 'two-stage EM' procedure of fitting covariance structure models in the presence of missing data. Both simulated and real data are used to illustrate the proposed procedures.",,"GOODNESS-OF-FIT,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,IGNORABLE MISSING DATA,LIMITED-INFORMATION,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,RESPONSE MODEL,FULL,PESSIMISM","Cai, Li@Univ Calif Los Angeles, GSE&IS, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Cai, Li@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"Missing data techniques for structural equation modeling+Allison, PD+JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 2003::no title+no author+GAUSS (Version 6.08)+2003::A goodness of fit test for sparse 2(p) contingency tables+Bartholomew, DJ; Leung, SO+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2002::The goodness of fit of latent trait models in attitude measurement+Bartholomew, DJ; Tzamourani, P+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1999::MEASUREMENT OF PESSIMISM - HOPELESSNESS SCALE+BECK, AT; WEISSMAN, A; LESTER, D; et al.+JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1974::MARGINAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF ITEM PARAMETERS - APPLICATION OF AN EM ALGORITHM+BOCK, RD; AITKIN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1981::FITTING A RESPONSE MODEL FOR N DICHOTOMOUSLY SCORED ITEMS+BOCK, RD; LIEBERMAN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1970::no title+BOCK RD+TESTFACT 4 USERS GUI+2003::ASYMPTOTICALLY DISTRIBUTION-FREE METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES+BROWNE, MW+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1984::Limited-information goodness-of-fit testing of item response theory models for sparse 2(P) tables+Cai, Li; Maydeu-Olivares, Albert; Coffman, Donna L.; et al.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2006::ASSESSING THE DIMENSIONALITY OF OPTIMISM AND PESSIMISM USING A MULTIMEASURE APPROACH+CHANG, EC; DZURILLA, TJ; MAYDEUOLIVARES, A+COGNITIVE THERAPY AND RESEARCH+APR 1994::no title+CURRAN PJ+1997 BIENN M SOC RES+1997::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Using the expectation maximization algorithm to estimate coefficient alpha for scales with item-level missing data+Enders, CK+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2003::Using an EM covariance matrix to estimate structural equation models with missing data: Choosing an adjusted sample size to improve the accuracy of inferences+Enders, CK; Peugh, JL+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+2004::no title+Holland, P; Bishop, Y.; Fienberg, S.+Discrete Multivariate Analysis: Theory and Practice.+1975::CAN TEST STATISTICS IN COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS BE TRUSTED+HU, LT; BENTLER, PM; KANO, Y+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+SEP 1992::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD COMPUTATIONS WITH REPEATED MEASURES - APPLICATION OF THE EM-ALGORITHM+LAIRD, N; LANGE, N; STRAM, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::Maximum likelihood estimation and model comparison for mixtures of structural equation models with ignorable missing data+Lee, SY; Song, XY+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+2003::Maximum likelihood estimation of nonlinear structural equation models with ignorable missing data+Lee, SY; Song, XY; Lee, JCK+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SUM 2003::Analysis of two-level structural equation models via EM type algorithms+Lee, SY; Poon, WY+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1998::no title+Little, RJA; Rubin, DB.+Statistical Analysis with Missing Data+2002::FINDING THE OBSERVED INFORMATION MATRIX WHEN USING THE EM ALGORITHM+LOUIS, TA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1982::no title+Mathai, A.

Goodness-of-fit testing using components based on marginal frequencies of multinomial data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X204215,NOV 2008,42,11,"The goodness-of-fit test based on Pearson's chi-squared statistic is sometimes considered to be an omnibus test that gives little guidance to the source of poor fit when the null hypothesis is rejected. It has also been recognized that the omnibus test can often be outperformed by focused or directional tests of lower order. In this paper, a test is considered for a model on a data table formed by the cross-classification of q dichotomous variables, and a score statistic on overlapping cells that correspond to the first-through qth-order marginal frequencies is presented. Then orthogonal components of the Pearson-Fisher statistic are defined on marginal frequencies. The orthogonal components may be used to form test statistics, and a log-linear version of an item response model is used to investigate the order and dilution of a test based on these components, as well as the projection of components onto the space of lower-order marginals. The advantage of the components in terms of power and detection of the source of poor fit is demonstrated.

Constructing second-order accurate confidence intervals for communalities in factor analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X204198,NOV 2008,29,2,"In an effort to find accurate alternatives to the usual confidence intervals based on normal approximations, this paper compares four methods of generating second-order accurate confidence intervals for non-standardized and standardized communalities in exploratory factor analysis under the normality assumption. The methods to generate the intervals employ, respectively, the Cornish-Fisher expansion and the approximate bootstrap confidence (ABC), and the bootstrap-t and the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap (BC(a)). The former two are analytical and the latter two are numerical. Explicit expressions of the asymptotic bias and skewness of the communality estimators, used in the analytical methods, are derived. A Monte Carlo experiment reveals that the performance of central intervals based on normal approximations is a consequence of imbalance of miscoverage on the left- and right-hand sides. The second-order accurate intervals do not require symmetry around the point estimates of the usual intervals and achieve better balance, even when the sample size is not large. The behaviours of the second-order accurate intervals were similar to each other, particularly for large sample sizes, and no method performed consistently better than the others.",,"LIKELIHOOD FACTOR-ANALYSIS,ROTATED FACTOR LOADINGS,ML FACTOR-ANALYSIS,STANDARD ERRORS,NORMALIZING TRANSFORMATIONS,EM ALGORITHMS","Ichikawa, Masanori@Tokyo Univ Foreign Studies, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838534, Japan::Konishi, Sadanori@Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Math, Fukuoka 812, Japan","Ichikawa, Masanori@Unknow::Konishi, Sadanori@Kyushu University",not exist,"no title+ANDERSON, T.

This allows the analysis of non-congeneric test-retest variables assumed to measure a common, possibly (temporally) transient, attribute. Temporal change in the attribute between different times of measurement is modelled by the true-change variable. Individual causal method effects, due to heterogeneity of the measurement methods, account for the imperfect correlation of the true-score variables at each time of measurement. The reliability of the composite scores, at each time of measurement, and the reliability of the difference composite score may be estimated with appropriate coefficients derived from the model. Measurements of daily life tension in adult females serve to illustrate how the model can be used empirically.",,"COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,ESSENTIAL TAU-EQUIVALENCE,COEFFICIENT-ALPHA,GAIN SCORES,COMPOSITE RELIABILITY,CONGENERIC MEASURES,SCALE RELIABILITY,ASSUMPTIONS,TESTS,INSTRUMENTS","Vautier, Stephane@Univ Toulouse, Ctr Etud & Rech Psychopathol, F-31058 Toulouse 9, France::Steyer, Rolf@Univ Jena, Inst Psychol, Jena, Germany::Boomsma, Anne@Univ Groningen, Fac Behav & Social Sci, Dept Sociol, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands","Vautier, Stephane@Unknow::Steyer, Rolf@Friedrich Schiller University of Jena::Boomsma, Anne@University of Groningen",not exist,"HOW WE SHOULD MEASURE CHANGE - OR SHOULD WE+CRONBACH, LJ+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1970::no title+CRONBACH LJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1951::Separating trait effects from trait-specific method effects in multitrait-multimethod models: A multiple-indicator CT-C(M-1) model+Eid, M; Lischetzke, T; Nussbeck, FW; et al.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 2003::A multitrait-multimethod model with minimal assumptions+Eid, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2000::Structural equation models for multitrait-multimethod data+Eid, M.; Lischetzke, T.; Nussbeck, F.

Generalized latent variable models with non-linear effects,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X213963,NOV 2008,58,9,"Until recently, item response models such as the factor analysis model for metric responses, the two-parameter logistic model for binary responses and the multinomial model for nominal responses considered only the main effects of latent variables without allowing for interaction or polynomial latent variable effects. However, non-linear relationships among the latent variables might be necessary in real applications. Methods for fitting models with non-linear latent terms have been developed mainly under the structural equation modelling approach. In this paper, we consider a latent variable model framework for mixed responses (metric and categorical) that allows inclusion of both non-linear latent and covariate effects. The model parameters are estimated using full maximum likelihood based on a hybrid integration-maximization algorithm.

An implicit enumeration method for an exact test of weighted kappa,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X227058,NOV 2008,40,1,"The kappa coefficient is one of the most widely used measures for evaluating the agreement between two raters asked to assign N objects to one of K nominal categories. Weighted versions of kappa enable partial credit to be awarded for near agreement, most notably in the case of ordinal categories. An exact significance test for weighted kappa can be conducted by enumerating all rater agreement tables with the same fixed marginal frequencies as the observed table, and accumulating the probabilities for all tables that produce a weighted kappa index that is greater than or equal to the observed measure. Unfortunately, complete enumeration of all tables is computationally unwieldy for modest values of N and K. We present an implicit enumeration algorithm for conducting an exact test of weighted kappa, which can be applied to tables of non-trivial size. The algorithm is particularly efficient for 'good' to 'excellent' values of weighted kappa that typically have very small p-values. Therefore, our method is beneficial for situations where resampling tests are of limited value because the number of trials needed to estimate the p-value tends to be large.",,"NOMINAL SCALE AGREEMENT,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,RATER AGREEMENT,STATISTICS,CATEGORIES,VARIANCE,SAMPLE","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Mkt, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Stahl, Stephanie@Unknow::Steinley, Douglas@Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol Sci, Columbia, MO USA","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State University@State University System of Florida::Stahl, Stephanie@Unknow::Steinley, Douglas@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"EXACT INFERENCE FOR CONTINGENCY-TABLES WITH ORDERED CATEGORIES+AGRESTI, A; MEHTA, CR; PATEL, NR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::Unwilling versus unable: Infants' understanding of intentional action+Behne, T; Carpenter, M; Call, J; et al.+DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAR 2005::Efficient exact p-value computation for small sample, sparse, and surprising categorical data+Bejerano, G; Friedman, N; Tishby, N+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY+OCT 2004::Exact and resampling probability values for weighted kappa+Berry, KJ; Johnston, JE; Mielke, PW+PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS+APR 2005::MEASURING AGREEMENT WHEN 2 OBSERVERS CLASSIFY PEOPLE INTO CATEGORIES NOT DEFINED IN ADVANCE+BRENNAN, RL; LIGHT, RJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1974::A new procedure for assessing reliability of scoring EEG sleep recordings+Cicchetti, D.V.; Allison, T.+American Journal of EEG Technology+Sept. 1971::Comparison of the null distributions of weighted kappa and the C ordinal statistic+Cicchetti, DV; Fleiss, JL.+Appl Psychol Meas+1977::no title+COHEN J+EDUC PSYCHOL MEAS+1960::WEIGHTED KAPPA - NOMINAL SCALE AGREEMENT WITH PROVISION FOR SCALED DISAGREEMENT OR PARTIAL CREDIT+COHEN, J+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1968::INTEGRATION AND GENERALIZATION OF KAPPAS FOR MULTIPLE RATERS+CONGER, AJ+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1980::no title+*CYT SOFTW CORP IN+STATXACT 7 US GUID+2006::Supportive colleague, unsupportive supervisor: the role of provider-specific constellations of social support at work in the development of low back pain.+Elfering, Achim; Semmer, Norbert K; Schade, Volker; et al.+Journal of occupational health psychology+2002-Apr::MOMENTS OF STATISTICS KAPPA AND WEIGHTED KAPPA+EVERITT, BS+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1968::Inferences about weighted kappa in the nonnull case+Fleiss, J.

Beta-binomial ANOVA for multivariate randomized response data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X226040,NOV 2008,20,1,"There is much empirical evidence that randomized response methods improve the cooperation of the respondents when asking sensitive questions. The traditional methods for analysing randomized response data are restricted to univariate data and only allow inferences at the group level due to the randomized response sampling design. Here, a novel beta-binomial model is proposed for analysing multivariate individual count data observed via a randomized response sampling design. This new model allows for the estimation of individual response probabilities (response rates) for multivariate randomized response data utilizing an empirical Bayes approach. A common beta prior specifies that individuals in a group are tied together and the beta prior parameters are allowed to be cluster-dependent. A Bayes factor is proposed to test for group differences in response rates. An analysis of a cheating study, where 10 items measure cheating or academic dishonesty, is used to illustrate application of the proposed model.",,"MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE","Fox, Jean-Paul@Univ Twente, Dept Res Methodol Measurement & Data Anal, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands","Fox, Jean-Paul@University of Twente","Fox, Jean-Paul@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0058-1496","Item randomized-response models for measuring noncompliance: Risk-return perceptions, social influences, and self-protective responses+Bockenholt, Ulf; van der Heijden, Peter G.

Controlling item exposure and test overlap on the fly in computerized adaptive testing,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X227067,NOV 2008,12,11,"This paper proposes an on-line version of the Sympson and Hetter procedure with test overlap control (SHT) that can provide item exposure control at both the item and test levels on the fly without iterative simulations. The on-line procedure is similar to the SHT procedure in that exposure parameters are used for simultaneous control of item exposure rates and test overlap rate. The exposure parameters for the on-line procedure, however, are updated sequentially on the fly, rather than through iterative simulations conducted prior to operational computerized adaptive tests (CATs). Unlike the SHT procedure, the on-line version can control item exposure rate and test overlap rate without time-consuming iterative simulations even when item pools or examinee populations have been changed. Moreover, the on-line procedure was found to perform better than the SHT procedure in controlling item exposure and test overlap for examinees who take tests earlier. Compared with two other on-line alternatives, this proposed on-line method provided the best all-around test security control. Thus, it would be an efficient procedure for controlling item exposure and test overlap in CATs.",,,"Chen, Shu-Ying@Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Psychol, Chiayi 62107, Taiwan::Lei, Pui-Wa@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Liao, Wen-Han@Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Psychol, Chiayi 62107, Taiwan","Chen, Shu-Ying@National Chung Cheng University::Lei, Pui-Wa@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Liao, Wen-Han@National Chung Cheng University","Lei, Pui-Wa@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8179-6623","a-stratified multistage computerized adaptive testing+Chang, HH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1999::Controlling item exposure and test overlap in computerized adaptive testing+Chen, SY; Lei, PW+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAY 2005::Effects of practical constraints on item selection rules at the early stages of computerized adaptive testing+Chen, SY; Ankenmann, RD+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SUM 2004::The relationship between item exposure and test overlap in computerized adaptive testing+Chen, SY; Ankenmann, RD; Spray, JA+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SUM 2003::Computerized adaptive testing using the nearest-neighbors criterion+Cheng, PE; Liou, M+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAY 2003::Item exposure control in CAT-ASVAB+Hetter, R.

Incorporating randomness in the Fisher information for improving item-exposure control in CATs,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X230937,NOV 2008,30,16,"The most commonly employed item selection rule in a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is that of selecting the item with the maximum Fisher information for the estimated trait level. This means a highly unbalanced distribution of item-exposure rates, a high overlap rate among examinees and, for item bank management, strong pressure to replace items with a high discrimination parameter in the bank. An alternative for mitigating these problems involves, at the beginning of the test, basing item selection mainly on randomness. As the test progresses, the weight of information in the selection increases. In the present work we study, for two selection rules, the progressive methods (Revuelta & Ponsoda, 1998) and the proportional method (Segall, 2004a), different functions that define the weight of the random component according to the position in the test of the item to be administered. The functions were tested in simulated item banks and in an operative bank. We found that both the progressive and the proportional methods tolerate a high weight of the random component with minimal or zero loss of accuracy, while bank security and maintenance are improved.",,"COMPUTERIZED ADAPTIVE TEST,SELECTION-RULES,WRITTEN ENGLISH,SHADOW TESTS,TEST OVERLAP,CONSTRAINTS,CRITERIA,MODEL","Ramon Barrada, Juan@Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Psicol, Bellaterra 08193, Spain::Olea, Julio@Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Psicol, Madrid, Spain::Ponsoda, Vicente@Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Psicol, Madrid, Spain::Jose Abad, Francisco@Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Psicol, Madrid, Spain","Ramon Barrada, Juan@Autonomous University of Barcelona::Olea, Julio@Autonomous University of Madrid::Ponsoda, Vicente@Autonomous University of Madrid::Jose Abad, Francisco@Autonomous University of Madrid","Barrada, Juan Ramon@B-8930-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6887-6277::Abad, Francisco@B-4379-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6728-2709::ponsoda, vicente@C-8313-2011","Methods for restricting maximum exposure rate in computerized adaptive testing+Barrada, J.

A note on using alpha and stratified alpha to estimate the reliability of a test composed of item parcels,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X72485,NOV 2008,32,6,"Several authors have suggested that prior to conducting a confirmatory factor analysis it may be useful to group items into a smaller number of item 'parcels' or 'testlets'. The present paper mathematically shows that coefficient alpha based on these parcel scores will only exceed alpha based on the entire set of items if W, the ratio of the average covariance of items between parcels to the average covariance of items within parcels, is greater than unity. If W is less than unity, however, and errors of measurement are uncorrelated, then stratified alpha will be a better lower bound to the reliability of a measure than the other two coefficients. Stratified alpha are also equal to the true reliability of a test when items within parcels are essentially tau-equivalent if one assumes that errors of measurement are not correlated.",,"COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS,COEFFICIENT-ALPHA,CONGENERIC MEASURES,PARALLEL TESTS,NONNORMAL DATA,QUESTIONNAIRE,GENERALIZABILITY,VALIDITY,ERRORS","Rae, Gordon@Univ Ulster, Sch Psychol, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland","Rae, Gordon@Ulster University",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS+1986::Item parceling issues in structural equation modelling+Bandalos, D.; Finney, S.+New developments and techniques in structural equation modelling+2001::no title+Battle, J.+Culture-Free Self-Esteem Inventories for Children and Adults+1981::A confirmatory factor analysis of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire among older people+Cheung, YB+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY+AUG 2002::SCALED TEST STATISTICS AND ROBUST STANDARD ERRORS FOR NONNORMAL DATA IN COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS - A MONTE-CARLO STUDY+CHOU, CP; BENTLER, PM; SATORRA, A+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1991::THEORY OF GENERALIZABILITY - A LIBERALIZATION OF RELIABILITY THEORY+CRONBACH, LJ; RAJARATNAM, N; GLESER, GC+BRITISH JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1963::ALPHA-COEFFICIENTS FOR STRATIFIED-PARALLEL TESTS+CRONBACH, LJ; SCHONEMANN, P; MCKIE, D+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+1965::no title+CRONBACH LJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1951::Reliability+Feldt, L.; Brennan, R.+Educational measurement+1989::Bias in coefficient alpha arising from heterogeneity of test content+Feldt, LS; Qualls, AL+APPLIED MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION+1996::Item Parceling Strategies in SEM: Investigating the Subtle Effects of Unmodeled Secondary Constructs+Hall, Rosalie J.; Snell, Andrea F.; Foust, Michelle Singer+ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH METHODS+JUL 1999::The use of item parcels in structural equation modelling: Non-normal data and small sample sizes+Hau, KT; Marsh, HW+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 2004::Perceived affiliation with family member roles: Validity and reliability of scores on the Children's Role Inventory+Kier, FJ; Buras, AR+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+AUG 1999::no title+Kline, R.

Feature selection in feature network models: Finding predictive subsets of features with the Positive Lasso,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X119365,MAY 2008,34,4,"A set of features is the basis for the network representation of proximity data achieved by feature network models (FNMs). Features are binary variables that characterize the objects in an experiment, with some measure of proximity as response variable. Sometimes features are provided by theory and play an important role in the construction of the experimental conditions. In some research settings, the features are not known a priori. This paper shows how to generate features in this situation and how to select an adequate subset of features that takes into account a good compromise between model fit and model complexity, using a new version of least angle regression that restricts coefficients to be non-negative, called the Positive Lasso. It will be shown that features can be generated efficiently with Gray codes that are naturally linked to the FNMs. The model selection strategy makes use of the fact that FNM can be considered as univariate multiple regression model. A simulation study shows that the proposed strategy leads to satisfactory results if the number of objects is less than or equal to 22. If the number of objects is larger than 22, the number of features selected by our method exceeds the true number of features in some conditions.",,"DISTINCTIVE FEATURES,SIMILARITY TREES,GRAY CODES,REGRESSION,COMMON","Frank, Laurence E.@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, Fac Social & Behav Sci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands::Heiser, Willem J.@Leiden Univ, Dept Psychol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Frank, Laurence E.@Utrecht University::Heiser, Willem J.@Leiden University","Frank, Laurence E.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4075-8129","MAPCLUS - A MATHEMATICAL-PROGRAMMING APPROACH TO FITTING THE ADCLUS MODEL+ARABIE, P; CARROLL, JD+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1980::A GRAPH-THEORETIC METHOD FOR ORGANIZING OVERLAPPING CLUSTERS INTO TREES, MULTIPLE TREES, OR EXTENDED TREES+CARROLL, JD; CORTER, JE+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1995::no title+Corter, J.

Computing inter-rater reliability and its variance in the presence of high agreement,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X126600,MAY 2008,18,275,"Pi (pi) and kappa (kappa) statistics are widely used in the areas of psychiatry and psychological testing to compute the extent of agreement between raters on nominally scaled data. It is a fact that these coefficients occasionally yield unexpected results in situations known as the paradoxes of kappa. This paper explores the origin of these limitations, and introduces an alternative and more stable agreement coefficient referred to as the AC(1) coefficient. Also proposed are new variance estimators for the multiple-rater generalized pi and AC(1) statistics, whose validity does not depend upon the hypothesis of independence between raters. This is an improvement over existing alternative variances, which depend on the independence assumption. A Monte-Carlo simulation study demonstrates the validity of these variance estimators for confidence interval construction, and confirms the value of AC(1) as an improved alternative to existing inter-rater reliability statistics.",,"WEIGHTED KAPPA,COEFFICIENT","Gwet, Kilem Li@STATAXIS Consulting, Gaithersburg, MD 20886 USA","Gwet, Kilem Li@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::Beyond kappa: A review of interrater agreement measures+Banerjee, M+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+MAR 1999::HIGH AGREEMENT BUT LOW KAPPA .2.

Estimating the polychoric correlation from misclassified data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X131136,MAY 2008,18,3,"Many variables that are used in social and behavioural science research are ordinal categorical or polytomous variables. When more than one polytomous variable is involved in an analysis, observations are classified in a contingency table, and a commonly used statistic for describing the association between two variables is the polychoric correlation. This paper investigates the estimation of the polychoric correlation when the data set consists of misclassified observations. Two approaches for estimating the polychoric correlation have been developed. One assumes that the probabilities in relation to misclassification are known, and the other uses a double sampling scheme to obtain information on misclassification. A parameter estimation procedure is developed, and statistical properties for the estimates are discussed. The practicability and applicability of the proposed approaches are illustrated by analysing data sets that are based on real and generated data. Excel programmes with visual basic for application (VBA) have been developed to compute the estimate of the polychoric correlation and its standard error. The use of the structural equation modelling programme Mx to find parameter estimates in the double sampling scheme is discussed.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,CATEGORICAL-DATA,MODELS,ERROR","Yiu, Choi-Fan@Unknow::Poon, Wai-Yin@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Yiu, Choi-Fan@Unknow::Poon, Wai-Yin@Chinese University of Hong Kong",not exist,"Modeling discrete choice with response error: Food stamp participation+Bollinger, CR; David, MH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::DOUBLE SAMPLING FOR EXACT VALUES IN SOME MULTIVARIATE MEASUREMENT ERROR PROBLEMS+BUONACCORSI, JP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1990::LOG-LINEAR MODELS FOR DOUBLY SAMPLED CATEGORICAL-DATA FITTED BY THE EM ALGORITHM+ESPELAND, MA; ODOROFF, CL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::A METHOD OF GENERATING BEST ASYMPTOTICALLY NORMAL ESTIMATES WITH APPLICATION TO THE ESTIMATION OF BACTERIAL DENSITIES+FERGUSON, TS+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1958::USE OF DOUBLE SAMPLING SCHEMES IN ANALYZING CATEGORICAL DATA WITH MISCLASSIFICATION ERRORS+HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::LIFE-STYLE SEGMENTATION WITH TAILORED INTERVIEWING+KAMAKURA, WA; WEDEL, M+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+AUG 1995::TEACHING ABOUT APPROXIMATE CONFIDENCE-REGIONS BASED ON MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION+MEEKER, WQ; ESCOBAR, LA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1995::The use of likelihood-based confidence intervals in genetic models+Neale, MC; Miller, MB+BEHAVIOR GENETICS+MAR 1997::no title+NEALE MC+MX STAT MODELING+1999::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF THE POLYCHLORIC CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT+OLSSON, U+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1979::PRECISION OF DOUBLE SAMPLING ESTIMATORS FOR COMPARING 2 PROBABILITIES+PALMGREN, J+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1987::INFERENCE USING SURROGATE OUTCOME DATA AND A VALIDATION SAMPLE+PEPE, MS+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1992::Multisample analysis of multivariate ordinal categorical variables+Poon, WY; Tang, FC+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+2002::A latent normal distribution model for analysing ordinal responses with applications in meta-analysis+Poon, WY+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 30 2004::ESTIMATING FROM MISCLASSIFIED DATA+PRESS, SJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1968::no title+Rao, C.

Based on the formula, item exposure parameters for new parallel item pools can be predicted without conducting additional iterative simulations. Results show that an interesting formula between item exposure parameters and item parameters in a pool can be found by using GP The item exposure parameters predicted based on the found formula were close to those observed from the Sympson and Hetter (1985) procedure and performed well in controlling item exposure rates. Similar results were observed for the Stocking and Lewis (1998) multinomial model for item selection and the Sympson and Hetter procedure with content balancing.

Estimating the pi* goodness of fit index for finite mixtures of item response models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X136843,MAY 2008,25,2,"Testing the fit of finite mixture models is a difficult task, since asymptotic results on the distribution of likelihood ratio statistics do not hold; for this reason, alternative statistics are needed. This paper applies the pi* goodness of fit statistic to finite mixture item response models. The pi* statistic assumes that the population is composed of two subpopulations - those that follow a parametric model and a residual group outside the model; pi* is defined as the proportion of population in the residual group. The population was divided into two or more groups, or classes. Several groups followed an item response model and there was also a residual group. The paper presents maximum likelihood algorithms for estimating item parameters, the probabilities of the groups and pi*.

Power of pairwise comparisons in the equal variance and unequal sample size case,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X153051,MAY 2008,24,12,"A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to compare five, pairwise multiple comparison procedures. The number of means varied from 4 to 6 and the sample size ratio varied from 1 to 60. Procedures were evaluated on the basis of Type I errors, any-pair power and all-pairs power. Four procedures were shown to be conservative, while the fifth provided adequate control of Type I errors only for restricted values of sample size ratios. No procedure was found to be uniformly most powerful. The Tukey-Kramer procedure was found to provide the best any-pair power provided it is applied without requiring a significant overall F test. In most cases, the Hayter-Fisher modification of the Tukey-Kramer was found to provide very good any-pair power and to be uniformly more powerful than the Tukey-Kramer when a significant overall F test is required. A partition-based version of Peritz's method usually provided the greatest all-pairs power.

Influence analysis for the factor analysis model with ranking data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X169991,MAY 2008,48,2,"Influence analysis is an important component of data analysis, and the local influence approach has been widely applied to many statistical models to identify influential observations and assess minor model perturbations since the pioneering work of Cook (1986). The approach is often adopted to develop influence analysis procedures for factor analysis models with ranking data. However, as this well-known approach is based on the observed data likelihood, which involves multidimensional integrals, directly applying it to develop influence analysis procedures for the factor analysis models with ranking data is difficult. To address this difficulty, a Monte Carlo expectation and maximization algorithm (MCEM) is used to obtain the maximum-likelihood estimate of the model parameters, and measures for influence analysis on the basis of the conditional expectation of the complete data log likelihood at the E-step of the MCEM algorithm are then obtained. Very little additional computation is needed to compute the influence measures, because it is possible to make use of the by-products of the estimation procedure. Influence measures that are based on several typical perturbation schemes are discussed in detail, and the proposed method is illustrated with two real examples and an artificial example.",,"STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,LOCAL INFLUENCE ANALYSIS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,PAIRED-COMPARISON MODELS,ITEM FACTOR MODELS,DATA AUGMENTATION,COMPARATIVE JUDGMENT,INCOMPLETE-DATA","Xu, Liang@SE Univ, Dept Math, Nanjing 210018, Peoples R China::Poon, Wai-Yin@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Lee, Sik-Yum@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Xu, Liang@Southeast University - China::Poon, Wai-Yin@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Lee, Sik-Yum@Chinese University of Hong Kong",not exist,"DIAGNOSTICS IN CATEGORICAL-DATA ANALYSIS+ANDERSEN, EB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1992::GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR PARAMETER ESTIMATION FOR LAW OF COMPARATIVE JUDGMENT+ARBUCKLE, J; NUGENT, JH+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1973::THURSTONIAN REPRESENTATION FOR PARTIAL RANKING DATA+BOCKENHOLT, U+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1992::no title+BOCKENHOLT U+PROBABILITY MODELS S+1993::no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::FACTOR AND IDEAL POINT ANALYSIS FOR INTERPERSONALLY INCOMPARABLE DATA+BRADY, HE+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 1989::Local Influence in Structural Equation Models+Cadigan, N.

This comparison can be used to determine predictor importance and is the basis for procedures such as Dominance Analysis. Results indicate that the asymptotic procedure provides the expected coverage rates for sample sizes of 200 or more, but in many cases much higher sample sizes are required to achieve adequate power.

A note on monotone likelihood ratio of the total score variable in unidimensional item response theory,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X173391,MAY 2008,20,4,"This note provides a direct, elementary proof of the fundamental result on monotone likelihood ratio of the total score variable in unidimensional item response theory (IRT). This result is very important for practical measurement in IRT because it justifies the use of the total score variable to order participants on the latent trait. The proof relies on a basic inequality for elementary symmetric functions which is proved by means of few purely algebraic, straightforward transformations. In particular, flaws in a proof of this result by Huynh [(1994). A new proof for monotone likelihood ratio for the sum of independent Bernoulli random variables. Psychometrika, 59, 77-79] are pointed out and corrected, and a natural generalization of the fundamental result to non-linear (quasi-ordered) latent trait spaces is presented. This may be useful for multidimensional IRT or knowledge space theory, in which the latent 'ability' spaces are partially ordered with respect to, for instance, coordinate-wise vector-ordering or set-inclusion, respectively.",,"POLYTOMOUS IRT MODELS,LATENT TRAIT,SUM SCORE,KNOWLEDGE,SPACES","Uenlue, Ali@Univ Augsburg, Inst Math, Dept Comp Oriented Stat & Data Anal, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany","Uenlue, Ali@University of Augsburg",not exist,"Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum,, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::no title+Doignon, J.

Wavelet modelling of collinearity judgment error,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X182580,MAY 2008,20,1,"Prior research has found that participants manifest complex profiles of error when they are asked to judge collinearity of stimulus elements. These studies used harmonic analysis to model the data, and found large departures from accurate collinear judgments, with the amplitude and specific angular position of departures from valid judgment varying from one participant to the next. The models appeared to be a composite of many large-, medium- and small-scale departures, but this could not be established with any certainty because of the global nature of harmonic model components. Wavelet modelling is better suited to answer the question of whether the error profile is produced by independent sources that vary in size and location. Here, we examined judgments of collinearity of dot pairs across 360 degrees of angular position. A priori and post hoc wavelet modelling strategies were used to identify independent sources of error that could not be attributed to chance, and some new statistical protocols were applied. We found evidence of error sources at several levels of scale, and these results were confirmed by the application of cross-validation methods that make no assumption about the nature of the error probability distribution.",,"ORIENTATION,DISCRIMINATION,SHRINKAGE","Greene, Ernest@Univ So Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA::Ogden, R.

A dynamic extraversion model. The brain's response to a single dose of a stimulant drug,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711007X185514,MAY 2008,42,8,"The aim of this paper is to present a mathematical dynamic modelling of the effect a stimulant drug has on different people which, at the same time, can be a useful tool for future brain studies. To this end, a dynamic model of the evolution of extraversion (considering its tonic and phasic aspects) has been constructed taking into account the unique personality trait theory and the general modelling methodology. This model consists of a delayed differential equation which, on one hand, considers that the active stimulus, a consequence of a single intake, is not constant; on the other hand, it contemplates that the state variable representing the phasic extraversion also represents the brain activation. The derivative of this state variable is calculated as the sum of the homeostatic control flow, the excitatory effect flow and the inhibitor effect flow. The solutions of this equation relate the tonic activation of an individual (that characterizes his or her personality) with his or her phasic activation level, whose evolution over time describes the organism's response to a single drug intake. These solutions quantitatively reproduce the predictions of current personality theories and anticipate vulnerability to drug misuse and addiction development.",,"OPPONENT-PROCESS THEORY,INTRAVENOUS COCAINE,PERSONALITY,MOTIVATION,METHYLPHENIDATE,BEHAVIOR,ABUSERS","Amigo, Salvador@Univ Valencia, Dept Personalitat Avaluacio & Tractaments Psicol, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain::Caselles, Antonio@Univ Valencia, Dept Matemat Aplicada, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain::Mico, Joan C.@Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Matemat Aplicada, IUMPA, Valencia, Spain","Amigo, Salvador@University of Valencia::Caselles, Antonio@University of Valencia::Mico, Joan C.@Universitat Politecnica de Valencia","Mico, Joan C.@K-5683-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7120-5458","ON THE ARBITRARY DISTINCTION BETWEEN STATES AND TRAITS+ALLEN, BP; POTKAY, CR+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+1981::no title+AMIGO S+INFORM PSICOLOGICA+2002::no title+AMIGO S+INFORM PSICOLOGICA+1999::no title+Amigo, S.+La teoria del rasgo unico de personalidad: Hacia una teoria unificada del cerebro y la conducta+2005::IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SYSTEMS-BASED MODELS GENERATOR SIGEM+CASELLES, A+CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS+JAN-FEB 1994::SYSTEMS DECOMPOSITION AND COUPLING+CASELLES, A+CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS+JUL-AUG 1993::STRUCTURE AND BEHAVIOR IN GENERAL SYSTEMS-THEORY+CASELLES, A+CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS+NOV-DEC 1992::Focal and asymmetric cortical degeneration syndromes+Caselli, RJ+NEUROLOGIST+JAN 1995::no title+Cattell, R.

Robust step-down tests for multivariate independent group designs,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X117853,NOV 2007,49,7,"A composite step-down procedure, in which a set of step-down tests are summarized collectively with Fisher's combination statistic, was considered to test for multivariate mean equality in two-group designs. An approximate degrees of freedom (ADF) composite procedure based on trimmed/Winsorized estimators and a non-pooled estimate of error variance is proposed, and compared to a composite procedure based on trimmed/Winsorized estimators and a pooled estimate of error variance. The step-down procedures were also compared to Hotelling's T-2 and Johansen's ADF global procedure based on trimmed estimators in a simulation study. Type I error rates of the pooled step-down procedure were sensitive to covariance heterogeneity in unbalanced designs; error rates were similar to those of Hotelling's T-2 across all of the investigated conditions. Type I error rates of the ADF composite step-down procedure were insensitive to covariance heterogeneity and less sensitive to the number of dependent variables when sample size was small than error rates of Johansen's test. The ADF composite step-down procedure is recommended for testing hypotheses of mean equality in two-group designs except when the data are sampled from populations with different degrees of multivariate skewness.",,"BEHRENS-FISHER PROBLEM,2-SAMPLE TRIMMED T,NONNORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS,POPULATION VARIANCES,CLINICAL-TRIALS,I ERROR,MANOVA,PERFORMANCE","Lix, Lisa M.@Univ Manitoba, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3E 3P5, Canada@Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada::Fouladi, Rachel T.@Univ Manitoba, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3E 3P5, Canada@Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Lix, Lisa M.@University of Manitoba@Simon Fraser University::Fouladi, Rachel T.@University of Manitoba@Simon Fraser University",not exist,"PROGRAMMING UNIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE+BOCK, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+1963::ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::A STEP-DOWN PROCEDURE OF ELIMINATING VARIABLES IN MULTI VARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE+CALINSKI T; KACZMAREK Z+Biometrical Journal+1977::no title+CHAKRAVORTI SR+SANKHYA+1975::no title+Cohen, J.+Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences+1988::METHOD FOR SIMULATING NON-NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+FLEISHMAN, AI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1978::Type I error control of two-group multivariate tests on means under conditions of heterogeneous correlation structure and varied multivariate distributions+Fouladi, RT; Yockey, RD+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2002::no title+GRIZZLE JE+CONTRIBUTION STATIST+1983::no title+HAMPEL FR+ROBUST STAT OPPROACH+1986::Simulating correlated multivariate nonnormal distributions: Extending the Fleishman power method+Headrick, TC; Sawilowsky, SS+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 1999::no title+HOLLINGSWORTH H+AM STAT ASS P SOCIAL+1982::The generalization of Student's ratio+Hotelling, H+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1931::Adjusting O'Brien's test to control type I error for the generalized nonparametric Behrens-Fisher problem+Huang, P; Tilley, BC; Woolson, RF; et al.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2005::no title+Huber, P J.+Robust statistics.+1981::ON ROBUSTNESS OF T2/0 TEST IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WHEN VARIANCE-COVARIANCE MATRICES ARE NOT EQUAL+ITO, K; SCHULL, WJ+BIOMETRIKA+1964::Robustness of ANOVA and MANOVA test procedures+Ito, P.

An alternative approach to evaluation of scale reliability following deletion of each component in a given composite is outlined that can be recommended in general for scale development purposes. The method provides ranges of plausible values for instrument reliability when dispensing with single components in a tentative composite, and permits testing hypotheses about reliability of resulting scale versions.

Further evaluating the conditional decision rule for comparing two independent means,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X62576,NOV 2007,71,17,"Many books on statistical methods advocate a 'conditional decision rule' when comparing two independent group means. This rule states that the decision as to whether to use a 'pooled variance' test that assumes equality of variance or a 'separate variance' Welch t test that does not should be based on the outcome of a variance equality test. In this paper, we empirically examine the Type I error rate of the conditional decision rule using four variance equality tests and compare this error rate to the unconditional use of either of the t tests (i.e. irrespective of the outcome of a variance homogeneity test) as well as several resampling-based alternatives when sampling from 49 distributions varying in skewness and kurtosis. Several unconditional tests including the separate variance test performed as well as or better than the conditional decision rule across situations. These results extend and generalize the findings of previous researchers who have argued that the conditional decision rule should be abandoned.",,"BEHRENS-FISHER PROBLEM,2-SAMPLE T-TEST,RANDOMIZATION TESTS,SAMPLE MEANS,F-TEST,VARIANCES,EQUALITY,ROBUSTNESS,DISTRIBUTIONS,NONNORMALITY","Hayes, Andrew F.@Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA::Cai, Li@Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA","Hayes, Andrew F.@Ohio State University@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina::Cai, Li@Ohio State University@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina","Hayes, Andrew@A-5936-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8329-1696","TYPE-I ERROR RATES FOR WELCH TEST AND JAMES 2ND-ORDER TEST UNDER NONNORMALITY AND INEQUALITY OF VARIANCE WHEN THERE ARE 2 GROUPS+ALGINA, J; OSHIMA, TC; LIN, WY+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+FAL 1994::no title+Andrews, D.

Over the 240 empirical values collected for each method investigated, in which we varied the total percentage of data trimmed, sample size, degree of variance heterogeneity, pairing of variances and group sizes, and population shape, one method resulted in exceptionally good control of Type I errors. However, under less extreme cases of non-normality and variance heterogeneity a number of methods exhibited reasonably good Type I error control. With regard to the power to detect non-null treatment effects, we found that the choice among the methods depended on the degree of non-normality and variance heterogeneity.

Estimating confidence intervals for principal component loadings: A comparison between the bootstrap and asymptotic results,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X109636,NOV 2007,38,38,"Confidence intervals (Cis) in principal component analysis (PCA) can be based on asymptotic standard errors and on the bootstrap methodology. The present paper offers an overview of possible strategies for bootstrapping in PCA. A motivating example shows that Ci estimates for the component loadings using different methods may diverge. We explain that this results from both differences in quality and in perspective on the rotational freedom of the population loadings. A comparative simulation study examines the quality of various estimated component loading Cis. The bootstrap approach is more flexible and generally yields better Cis than the asymptotic approach. However, in the case of a clear simple structure of varimax rotated loadings, one can be confident that the asymptotic estimates are reasonable as well.",,"ROTATED FACTOR LOADINGS,EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS,STANDARD ERRORS,ORTHOGONAL ROTATION,ANALYTIC ROTATION,CRITERION,NUMBER,BIAS","Timmerman, Marieke E.@Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands::Kiers, Henk A.

Extensions of this method to multidimensional data are proposed. A simulation study is used to investigate whether these extensions produce biased estimates of important statistics in multidimensional data, and to compare them with lower benchmark listwise deletion, two-way with error and multivariate normal imputation. The new methods produce smaller bias in several psychometrically interesting statistics than the existing methods of two-way with error and multivariate normal imputation.

Design sequences for sensory studies: Achieving balance for carry-over and position effects,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X114568,NOV 2007,18,12,"In sequences of human sensory assessments, the response toa. stimulus may be influenced by previous stimuli. When investigating this phenomenon experimentally with several types or levels of stimulus, it is useful to have treatment sequences which are balanced for first-order carry-over effects. The requirement of balance for each experimental participant leads us to consider sequences of n symbols comprising an initial symbol followed by n 'blocks' each containing a permutation of the symbols. These sequences are designed to include all n 2 ordered pairs of symbols once each, and to have treatment and sequence position effects which are approximately or thogonal. Such sequences were suggested by Finney and Outhwaite (1956), who were able to find examples for particular values of n. We describe and illustrate acomputer algorithm for systematically enumerating the sequences for those values of n for which they exist. Criteria are proposed for choosing between the sequences according to the nearness to orthogonality of their treatment and position effects.",,"CONTRAST,JUDGMENT,ASSIMILATION","Nonyane, B. A.

Conditional mixed models with crossed random effects,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X110562,NOV 2007,20,6,"The analysis of continuous hierarchical data such as repeated measures or data from meta-analyses can be carried out by means of the linear mixed-effects model. However, in some situations this model, in its standard form, does pose computational problems. For example, when dealing with crossed random-effects models, the estimation of the variance components becomes a non-trivial task if only one observation is available for each cross-classified level. Pseudolikelihood ideas have been used in the context of binary data with standard generalized linear multilevel models. However, even in this case the problem of the estimation of the variance remains non-trivial. In this paper we first propose a method to fit a crossed random-effects model with two levels and continuous outcomes, borrowing ideas from conditional linear mixed-effects model theory. We also propose a crossed random-effects model for binary data combining ideas of conditional logistic regression with pseudolikelihood estimation. We apply this method to a case study with data coming from the field of psychometrics and study a series of items (responses) crossed with participants. A simulation study assesses the operational characteristics of the method.",,"IRT MODEL,ERROR","Tibaldi, Fabian S.@Eli Lilly & Co, B-1348 Mont St Guibert, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium@Hasselt Univ, Diepenbeek, Belgium::Verbeke, Geert@Eli Lilly & Co, B-1348 Mont St Guibert, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium@Hasselt Univ, Diepenbeek, Belgium::Molenberghs, Geert@Eli Lilly & Co, B-1348 Mont St Guibert, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium@Hasselt Univ, Diepenbeek, Belgium::Renard, Didier@Eli Lilly & Co, B-1348 Mont St Guibert, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium@Hasselt Univ, Diepenbeek, Belgium::Van den Noortgate, Wirn@Eli Lilly & Co, B-1348 Mont St Guibert, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium@Hasselt Univ, Diepenbeek, Belgium::de Boeck, Paul@Eli Lilly & Co, B-1348 Mont St Guibert, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium@Hasselt Univ, Diepenbeek, Belgium","Tibaldi, Fabian S.@Eli Lilly@KU Leuven@Hasselt University::Verbeke, Geert@Eli Lilly@KU Leuven@Hasselt University::Molenberghs, Geert@Eli Lilly@KU Leuven@Hasselt University::Renard, Didier@Eli Lilly@KU Leuven@Hasselt University::Van den Noortgate, Wirn@Eli Lilly@KU Leuven@Hasselt University::de Boeck, Paul@Eli Lilly@KU Leuven@Hasselt University","De Boeck, Paul@L-3508-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0884-2582::Verbeke, Geert@I-5587-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8430-7576","no title+Aerts, M.; Geys, H.; Molenberghs, G.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Ryan, L</span>.+Topics in Modelling of Clustered Data+2002::no title+Bryk, A.S; Raudenbush, S.W.+Hierarchical linear models+1992::no title+DEBOECK P+ONWIKKELING VAN EEN+1997::ESTIMATION IN COVARIANCE COMPONENTS MODELS+DEMPSTER, AP; RUBIN, DB; TSUTAKAWA, RK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1981::no title+Fahrmeir, L.; Tutz, G.+Multivariate statistical modelling based on generalized linear models+2001::Bayesian modeling of measurement error in predictor variables using item response theory+Fox, JP; Glas, CAW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2003::Bayesian estimation of a multilevel IRT model using Gibbs sampling+Fox, JP; Glas, CAW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2001::MULTILEVEL COVARIANCE COMPONENT MODELS+GOLDSTEIN, H+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1987::BAYESIAN INFERENCE FOR VARIANCE COMPONENTS USING ONLY ERROR CONTRASTS+HARVILLE, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1974::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD APPROACHES TO VARIANCE COMPONENT ESTIMATION AND TO RELATED PROBLEMS+HARVILLE, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::A hierarchical IRT model for criterion-referenced measurement+Janssen, R; Tuerlinckx, F; Meulders, M; et al.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+FAL 2000::RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS FOR LONGITUDINAL DATA+LAIRD, NM; WARE, JH+BIOMETRICS+1982::Tests for linkage of multiple cohorts in an accelerated longitudinal design+Miyazaki, Y; Raudenbush, SW+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 2000::no title+MOLENBERGHS G+DISCRETE LONGITUDINA+2005::RECOVERY OF INTER-BLOCK INFORMATION WHEN BLOCK SIZES ARE UNEQUAL+PATTERSON, HD; THOMPSON, R+BIOMETRIKA+1971::A CROSSED RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL FOR UNBALANCED DATA WITH APPLICATIONS IN CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH+RAUDENBUSH, SW+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+WIN 1993::no title+Seber, G.

Assessing change with the extended logistic model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X107548,NOV 2007,17,4,"The purpose of this article is to define a method for the assessment of change. A reinterpretation of the extended logistic model is proposed. The extended logistic model for the assessment of change (ELMAC) allows the definition of a time parameter which is supposed to identify whether change occurs during a period of time, given a specific event or phenomenon. The assessment of a trend of change through time, on the basis of the time parameter which is estimated at different successive occasions during a period of time, is also considered. In addition, a dispersion parameter is calculated which identifies whether change is consistent at each time point. The issue of independence is taken into account both in relation to the time parameter and the dispersion parameter. An application of the ELMAC in a learning process is presented. The interpretation of the model parameters and the model fit statistics is consistent with expectations.",,,"Cristante, Francesca@Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, I-35100 Padua, Italy::Robusto, Egidio@Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, I-35100 Padua, Italy","Cristante, Francesca@University of Padua::Robusto, Egidio@University of Padua",not exist,"A general form of Rasch's extended logistic model for partial credit scoring+Andrich, D.+Applied Measurement in Education+1988::AN EXTENSION OF THE RASCH MODEL FOR RATINGS PROVIDING BOTH LOCATION AND DISPERSION PARAMETERS+ANDRICH, D+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1982::AN ELABORATION OF GUTTMAN SCALING WITH RASCH MODELS FOR MEASUREMENT+ANDRICH, D+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY+1985::A latent trait model for items with response dependencies: Implications for test construction and analysis+Andrich, D.+Test design: Contributions from psychology, education and psychometrics+1985::Conditional pairwise estimation in the Rasch model for ordered response categories using principal components.+Andrich, David; Luo, Guanzhong+Journal of applied measurement+2003::no title+COLLINS LM+BEST METHODS ASSESSE+1991::Some applications of logistic latent trait models with linear constraints on the parameters+Fischer, G.

An algorithm for extracting maximum cardinality subsets with perfect dominance or anti-Robinson structures,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X107872,NOV 2007,26,1,"A common criterion for seriation of asymmetric matrices is the maximization of the dominance index, which sums the elements above the main diagonal of a reordered matrix. Similarly, a popular seriation criterion for symmetric matrices is the maximization of an anti-Robinson gradient index, which is associated with the patterning of elements in the rows and columns of a reordered matrix. Although perfect dominance and perfect anti-Robinson structure are rarely achievable for empirical matrices, we can often identify a sizable subset of objects for which a perfect structure is realized. We present and demonstrate an algorithm for obtaining a maximum cardinality (i.e. the largest number of objects) subset of objects such that the seriation of the proximity matrix corresponding to the subset will have perfect structure. MATLAB implementations of the algorithm are available for dominance, anti-Robinson and strongly anti-Robinson structures.",,"PAIRED-COMPARISON RANKING,ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITY MEASURES,NEAREST ADJOINING ORDERS,BOUND ALGORITHM,SLATERS I,MATRICES,SERIATION,BRANCH,CONFUSION","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Mkt, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Stahl, Stephanie@Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Mkt, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State University@State University System of Florida::Stahl, Stephanie@Florida State University@State University System of Florida",not exist,"APPLICATIONS OF COMBINATORIAL PROGRAMMING TO DATA-ANALYSIS - SERIATION USING ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITY MEASURES+BAKER, FB; HUBERT, LJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1977::no title+BRUSCO MJ+BRANCH AND BOUND APP+2005::Seriation of asymmetric matrices using integer linear programming+Brusco, MJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 2001::Branch-and-bound algorithm for fitting anti-Robinson structures to symmetric dissimilarity matrices+Brusco, MJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 2002::Compact integer-programming models for extracting subsets of stimuli from confusion matrices+Brusco, MJ; Stahl, S+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 2001::BRANCH AND BOUND ALGORITHM FOR MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD PAIRED COMPARISON RANKING+DECANI, JS+BIOMETRIKA+1972::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD PAIRED COMPARISON RANKING BY LINEAR PROGRAMMING+DECANI, JS+BIOMETRIKA+1969::Orders and overlapping clusters in pyramids+Diday, E.+Multidimensional data analysis+1986::One-to-one correspondences in pyramidal representation: a unified approach+Durand, C.; Fichet, B.+Classification and Related Methods of Data Analysis.

Asymptotic expansion of the distributions of the estimators in factor analysis under non-normality,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X110904,NOV 2007,29,13,"Equations for the Edgeworth expansion of the distributions of the estimators in exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling are given. The equations cover the cases of non-normal data, as well as normal ones with and without known first-order asymptotic standard errors. When the standard errors are unknown, the distributions of the Studentized statistics are expanded. Methods of constructing confidence intervals of population parameters with arbitrary asymptotic confidence coefficients are given using the Cornish-Fisher expansion. Simulations are performed to see the usefulness of the asymptotic expansions in exploratory factor analysis with rotated solutions and confirmatory factor analysis. The results show that asymptotic expansion gives substantial improvement of approximation to the exact distribution constructed by simulations over the usual normal approximation.",,"STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,UNIFIED APPROACH,STANDARD ERRORS,ROBUSTNESS,BIASES,SIMULATION","Ogasawara, Haruhiko@Otaru Univ, Dept Informat & Management Sci, Otaru, Hokkaido 0478501, Japan","Ogasawara, Haruhiko@Otaru University",not exist,"STANDARD ERRORS FOR ROTATED FACTOR LOADINGS+ARCHER, CO; JENNRICH, RI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1973::Covariance structures+Browne, M.W.+Tapies in Applied Multivariate Analysis+1982::ROBUSTNESS OF NORMAL THEORY METHODS IN THE ANALYSIS OF LINEAR LATENT VARIATE MODELS+BROWNE, MW; SHAPIRO, A+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1988::FACTOR ANALYSIS BY LAWLEY'S METHOD OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD+Emmett, W.

Existing methods to derive a network model from empirical data only give the best-fitting network and yield no standard errors for the parameter estimates. The additivity properties of networks make it possible to consider the model as a univariate (multiple) linear regression problem with positivity restrictions on the parameters. In the present study, both theoretical and empirical standard errors are obtained for the constrained regression parameters of a network model with known features. The performance of both types of standard error is evaluated using Monte Carlo techniques.",,"STIMULUS SIMILARITY,INEQUALITY,REPRESENTATION,CONSTRAINTS,GRAPHS,TREES","Frank, Laurence E.@Univ Utrecht, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands@Leiden Univ, Dept Psychol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands::Heiser, Willem J.@Univ Utrecht, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands@Leiden Univ, Dept Psychol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Frank, Laurence E.@Utrecht University@Leiden University::Heiser, Willem J.@Utrecht University@Leiden University","Frank, Laurence E.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4075-8129","no title+BJORK A+NUMERICAL METHODS LE+1996::A GRAPH-THEORETIC METHOD FOR ORGANIZING OVERLAPPING CLUSTERS INTO TREES, MULTIPLE TREES, OR EXTENDED TREES+CARROLL, JD; CORTER, JE+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+1995::no title+Corter, J.

Hypothesis tests for population heterogeneity in meta-analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X64042,MAY 2007,69,45,"Choice of the appropriate model in meta-analysis is often treated as an empirical question which is answered by examining the amount of variability in the effect sizes. When all of the observed variability in the effect sizes can be accounted for based on sampling error alone, a set of effect sizes is said to be homogeneous and a fixed-effects model is typically adopted. Whether a set of effect sizes is homogeneous or not is usually tested with the so-called Q test. In this paper, a variety of alternative homogeneity tests - the likelihood ratio, Wald and score tests - are compared with the Q test in terms of their Type I error rate and power for four different effect size measures. Monte Carlo simulations show that the Q test kept the tightest control of the Type I error rate, although the results emphasize the importance of large sample sizes within the set of studies. The results also suggest under what conditions the power of the tests can be considered adequate.",,"RESTRICTED MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL,MIXED-EFFECTS MODEL,VARIANCE-COMPONENTS,MONTE-CARLO,I ERROR,CORRELATION-COEFFICIENTS,VALIDITY GENERALIZATION,UNBIASED ESTIMATION,STATISTICAL POWER","Viechtbauer, Wolfgang@Univ Maastricht, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Viechtbauer, Wolfgang@Maastricht University@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@University of Illinois System","Viechtbauer, Wolfgang@M-1549-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3463-4063","STATISTICAL AND EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION OF THE CHI-SQUARE TEST FOR HOMOGENEITY OF CORRELATIONS IN META-ANALYSIS+ALEXANDER, RA; SCOZZARO, MJ; BORODKIN, LJ+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+SEP 1989::A RANDOM-EFFECTS REGRESSION-MODEL FOR METAANALYSIS+BERKEY, CS; HOAGLIN, DC; MOSTELLER, F; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 28 1995::Meta-analysis of raw mean differences+Bond, CF; Wiitala, WL; Richard, FD+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2003::A comparison of statistical methods for meta-analysis+Brockwell, SE; Gordon, IR+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAR 30 2001::UNBIASED ESTIMATION OF SAMPLING VARIANCE OF CORRELATIONS+CALLENDER, JC; OSBURN, HG+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1988::Problems arising in the analysis of a series of similar experiments.+COCHRAN, W.

Decision making in the short and long run: Repeated gambles and rationality,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X124143,MAY 2007,26,6,"Experimental evidence indicates that decision makers who reject a single play of a gamble may accept repeated plays of that gamble. The rationality of this pattern of preference has been investigated beginning with Samuelson's colleague (SC) who gained notoriety in a well-known paper. SCs pattern of preference is commonly viewed as a behavioural anomaly. Researchers from branches of psychology and economics have analysed the choice and, despite much debate, there remains considerable confusion. An axiomatic analysis of SCs choice has been used to motivate experimental studies in several disciplines. This paper identifies the axiomatic violation as that of an assumed rather than a normative condition. Therefore, contrary to popular belief, SC's choice is consistent with expected utility theory.",,"RISK-AVERSION,PROSPECT-THEORY,UTILITY-THEORY,LARGE NUMBERS,INVESTMENTS,ASPIRATION,FALLACY,CHOICES,ESSENCE,TIME","Aloysius, John A.@Univ Arkansas, Walton Coll Business, Dept Informat Syst, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Aloysius, John A.@University of Arkansas Fayetteville@University of Arkansas System",not exist,"no title+ALOYSIUS JA+J SOCIOECONOMICS+2005::Rational escalation of costs by playing a sequence of unfavorable gambles: the martingale+Aloysius, JA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR &amp; ORGANIZATION+MAY 2003::Risk aggregation and the efficient selection of joint projects by a consortium+Aloysius, JA+OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+JUN 1999::Risk aversion or myopia?

Bayesian analysis for proportions with an independent background effect,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/00071100SX86705,MAY 2007,13,7,"Conventional Bayesian analysis for proportions is not appropriate for proportions with a background effect, for example, for the proportion of correct responses in a sensory difference test using a forced-choice method with a guessing probability. The main difficulty is that it is not reasonable to assume that a proportion with a background effect has a beta prior distribution. A generalized posterior distribution for proportions is derived in this paper. It includes the standard beta posterior distribution for a proportion without background effect as a special case. Bayesian inference and Bayesian sample size determination for proportions based on the generalized posterior distribution are discussed.",,"DIFFERENCE,TESTS","Bi, Jian@Sensometr Res & Serv, Richmond, VA USA","Bi, Jian@Unknow",not exist,"Sample size determination: A review+Adcock, CJ+STATISTICIAN+1997::no title+ADCOCK CJ+STATISTICIAN+1987::no title+Amerine, M.

Detection of long-range dependence and estimation of fractal exponents through ARFIMA modelling,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X89513,MAY 2007,54,49,"We evaluate the performance of autoregressive, fractionally integrated, moving average (ARFIMA) modelling for detecting long-range dependence and estimating fractal exponents. More specifically, we test the procedure proposed by Wagenmakers, Farrell, and Ratcliff, and compare the results obtained with the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayes information criterion (BIC). The present studies show that ARFIMA modelling is able to adequately detect long-range dependence in simulated fractal series. Conversely, this method tends to produce a non-negligible rate of false detections in pure autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) series. Generally, ARFIMA modelling has a bias favouring the detection of long-range dependence. AIC and BIC gave dissimilar results, due to the different weights attributed by the two criteria to accuracy and parsimony. Finally, ARFI MA modelling provides good estimates of fractal exponents, and could adequately complement classical methods, such as spectral analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis or rescaled range analysis.",,"SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY,TIME-SERIES,HUMAN COGNITION,1/F NOISE,1/F(ALPHA) NOISE,VARIABILITY,SELECTION,MOVEMENT,PERFORMANCE,DYNAMICS","Torre, Kierstin@Univ Montpellier 1, Fac Sport Sci, EA Motor Efficiency & Deficiency 2991, F-34090 Montpellier, France::Delignieres, Didier@Univ Montpellier 1, Fac Sport Sci, EA Motor Efficiency & Deficiency 2991, F-34090 Montpellier, France::Lemoine, Loic@Univ Montpellier 1, Fac Sport Sci, EA Motor Efficiency & Deficiency 2991, F-34090 Montpellier, France","Torre, Kierstin@Universite de Montpellier@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)::Delignieres, Didier@Universite de Montpellier@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)::Lemoine, Loic@Universite de Montpellier@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)",not exist,"Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+P 2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY+BAK, P; CHEN, K+SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN+JAN 1991::no title+BOX GEP+TIME SERIES ANAL+1970::Finite sample criteria for autoregressive order selection+Broersen, PMT+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING+DEC 2000::Analyzing exact fractal time series: evaluating dispersional analysis and rescaled range methods+Caccia, DC; Percival, D; Cannon, MJ; et al.+PHYSICA A+DEC 1 1997::Long memory processes (1/f(alpha) type) in human coordination+Chen, YQ; Ding, MZ; Kelso, JAS+PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS+DEC 1 1997::1/f(alpha) noise from self-organized critical models with uniform driving+Davidsen, J; Schuster, HG+PHYSICAL REVIEW E+NOV 2000::TESTS FOR HURST EFFECT+DAVIES, RB; HARTE, DS+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1987::Dynamics of the learning of a morphokinetic movement sequence in humans+Delcor, L; Cadopi, M; Delignieres, D; et al.+NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS+JAN 9 2003::Time intervals production in tapping and oscillatory motion+Delignieres, D; Lemoine, L; Torre, K+HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE+SEP 2004::Fractal analyses for 'short' time series: A re-assessment of classical methods+Delignieres, Didier; Ramdani, Sofiane; Lemoine, Loic; et al.+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+DEC 2006::The fractal dynamics of self-esteem and physical self.+Delignieres, Didier; Fortes, Marina; Ninot, Gregory+Nonlinear dynamics, psychology, and life sciences+2004-Oct::A note on long memory time series+Diebolt, C; Guiraud, V+QUALITY &amp; QUANTITY+DEC 2005::no title+Doornik, J.

Local measures of association: Estimating the derivative of the regression line,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X98305,MAY 2007,20,1,"A local measure of association that allows both heterosceclasticity and a non-linear association was developed during the 1990s. The basic goal is to measure the strength of the association between X and Y given X, when Y = theta(X) + tau(X)epsilon for some unknown functions theta(X) and tau(X). Application of this method requires the estimation of the derivative of theta(X). The focus in this paper is on four alternatives to a very slight modification of the method used by Doksum et al. when estimating this derivative. The main result is that in simulations, a certain robust analogue of their method dominates in terms of mean squared error, even under normality. The bias of the method is found to be small but a little larger than the bias associated with the method used by Doksum et aL The method is based in part on bootstrap bagging followed by a lowess smooth.",,"QUANTILE ESTIMATORS,CORRELATION CURVES","Wilcox, Rand R.@Univ So Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Wilcox, Rand R.@University of Southern California","Wilcox, Rand@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2524-2976","CORRELATION CURVES - MEASURES OF ASSOCIATION AS FUNCTIONS OF COVARIATE VALUES+BJERVE, S; DOKSUM, K+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1993::Analyzing bagging+Buhlmann, P; Yu, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2002::Scale space view of curve estimation+Chaudhuri, P; Marron, JS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2000::ROBUST LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION AND SMOOTHING SCATTERPLOTS+CLEVELAND, WS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::Recent developments in bootstrap methodology+Davison, AC; Hinkley, DV; Young, GA+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2003::A COMPARISON OF QUANTILE ESTIMATORS+DIELMAN, T; LOWRY, C; PFAFFENBERGER, R+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1994::CORRELATION CURVES AS LOCAL MEASURES OF VARIANCE EXPLAINED BY REGRESSION+DOKSUM, K; BLYTH, S; BRADLOW, E; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1994::no title+Fan, J.; Gijbels, I.+Local Polynomial Modelling and its Applications+1996::LOCAL LINEAR-REGRESSION SMOOTHERS AND THEIR MINIMAX EFFICIENCIES+FAN, JQ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1993::SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE BOXPLOT+FRIGGE, M; HOAGLIN, DC; IGLEWICZ, B+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1989::no title+Hardle, W.+Applied nonparametric regression+1990::no title+Hastie, T.; Tibshirani, R.+Generalized additive models+1990::no title+Hoaglin, D.

Bayesian adaptive estimation of arbitrary points on a psychometric function,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X104596,MAY 2007,39,13,"Bayesian adaptive methods have been extensively used in psychophysics to estimate the point at which performance on a task attains arbitrary percentage levels, although the statistical properties of these estimators have never been assessed. We used simulation techniques to determine the small-sample properties of Bayesian estimators of arbitrary performance points, specifically addressing the issues of bias and precision as a function of the target percentage level. The study covered three major types of psychophysical task (yes-no detection, 2AFC discrimination and 2AFC detection) and explored the entire range of target performance levels allowed for by each task. Other factors included in the study were the form and parameters of the actual psychometric function Psi, the form and parameters of the model function M assumed in the Bayesian method, and the location of Psi within the parameter space. Our results indicate that Bayesian adaptive methods render unbiased estimators of any arbitrary point on psi only when M = Psi, and otherwise they yield bias whose magnitude can be considerable as the target level moves away from the midpoint of the range of Psi. The standard error of the estimator also increases as the target level approaches extreme values whether or not M = Psi. Contrary to widespread belief, neither the performance level at which bias is null nor that at which standard error is minimal can be predicted by the sweat factor. A closed-form expression nevertheless gives a reasonable fit to data describing the dependence of standard error on number of trials and target level, which allows determination of the number of trials that must be administered to obtain estimates with prescribed precision.",,"FIXED STEP SIZES,FORCED-CHOICE STAIRCASES,UP-DOWN METHOD,PSYCHOPHYSICAL PROCEDURES,SEQUENTIAL ESTIMATION,THRESHOLD ESTIMATION,EFFICIENT,QUEST,SENSITIVITY,FREQUENCY","Garcia-Perez, Miguel A.@Univ Complutense, Fac Psicol, Dept Metodol, Madrid 28223, Spain::Alcala-Quintana, Rocio@Univ Complutense, Fac Psicol, Dept Metodol, Madrid 28223, Spain","Garcia-Perez, Miguel A.@Complutense University of Madrid::Alcala-Quintana, Rocio@Complutense University of Madrid","Alcala-Quintana, Rocio@H-6323-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8611-2067::Garcia-Perez, Miguel Angel@F-7043-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2669-4429","The role of parametric assumptions in adaptive Bayesian estimation+Alcala-Quintana, R;

Bootstrapping the estimated latent distribution of the two-parameter latent trait model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711006X107539,MAY 2007,21,7,"This paper focuses on the two-parameter latent trait model for binary data. Although the prior distribution of the latent variable is usually assumed to be a standard normal distribution, that prior distribution can be estimated from the data as a discrete distribution using a combination of EM algorithms and other optimization methods. We assess with what precision we can estimate the prior from the data, using simulations and bootstrapping. A novel calibration method is given to check that near optimality is achieved for the bootstrap estimates. We find that there is sufficient information on the prior distribution to be informative, and that the bootstrap method is reliable. We illustrate the bootstrap method for two sets of real data.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,EM ALGORITHM,COMPONENTS,PARAMETERS","Knott, M.@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, London WC2A 2AE, England::Tzamourani, P.@Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, London WC2A 2AE, England","Knott, M.@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London::Tzamourani, P.@London School Economics & Political Science@University of London",not exist,"A general maximum likelihood analysis of variance components in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1999::A general maximum likelihood analysis of overdispersion in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+SEP 1996::THE SENSITIVITY OF LATENT TRAIT ANALYSIS TO CHOICE OF PRIOR DISTRIBUTION+BARTHOLOMEW, DJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1988::Test scores, sufficient statistics, and the information structures of tests+Birnbaum, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::MARGINAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF ITEM PARAMETERS - APPLICATION OF AN EM ALGORITHM+BOCK, RD; AITKIN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1981::no title+BOHNING D+COMPUTER ASSISTED AN+1999::A REVIEW OF RELIABLE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ALGORITHMS FOR SEMIPARAMETRIC MIXTURE-MODELS+BOHNING, D+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 1995::The EM algorithm with gradient function update for discrete mixtures with known (fixed) number of components+Bohning, D+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+AUG 2003::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION IN GENERALIZED RASCH MODELS+DELEEUW, J; VERHELST, N+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+FAL 1986::Asymptotic identifiability of nonparametric item response models+Douglas, JA+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::no title+Efron, B.; Tibshirani, R.

Statistical inference in generalized linear mixed models: A review,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005x79857,NOV 2006,101,45,"We present a review of statistical inference in generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). GLMMs are an extension of generalized linear models and are suitable for the analysis of non-normal data with a clustered structure. A GLMM contains parameters common to all clusters (fixed regression effects and variance components) and cluster-specific parameters. The latter parameters are assumed to be randomly drawn from a population distribution. The parameters of this population distribution (the variance components) have to be estimated together with the fixed effects. We focus on the case in which the cluster-specific parameters are normally distributed. The cluster-specific effects are integrated out of the likelihood so that the fixed effects and variance components can be estimated. Unfortunately, the integral over the cluster-specific effects is intractable for most GLMMs with a normal mixing distribution. Within a classical statistical framework, we distinguish between two broad classes of methods to handle this intractable integral: methods that rely on a numerical approximation to the integral and methods that use an analytical approximation to the integrand. Finally, we present an overview of available methods for testing hypotheses about the parameters of GLMMs.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,MULTILEVEL MODELS,EM ALGORITHM,BINARY RESPONSES,INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS,ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES,DISCRETE RESPONSE,LONGITUDINAL DATA,BIAS CORRECTION,RASCH MODEL","Tuerlinckx, Francis@Univ Louvain, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Univ Louvain, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Rijmen, Frank@Univ Louvain, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Univ Louvain, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Verbeke, Geert@Univ Louvain, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Univ Louvain, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::De Boeck, Paul@Univ Louvain, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Univ Louvain, Ctr Biostat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Tuerlinckx, Francis@Unknow@Unknow::Rijmen, Frank@Unknow@Unknow::Verbeke, Geert@Unknow@Unknow::De Boeck, Paul@Unknow@Unknow","De Boeck, Paul@L-3508-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0884-2582::Verbeke, Geert@I-5587-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8430-7576","no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.

Estimating sensitivity and bias in a yes/no task,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X65753,NOV 2006,7,6,"The estimation of sensitivity and bias from data collected in a yes/no detection-theoretic experiment is complicated by the possibility of proportions of 0 or 1 appearing in the resulting contingency table. Inverse normal transforms of these probabilities result in mathematically intractable infinities. Typically, some transformation of the data must be applied prior to parameter estimation. Several transformations have been reviewed in the literature, in terms of both the bias and the variance of the estimates they produce. We propose three generalized transformations, which contain the two most reported transformations as special cases, and consider their performance in terms of the mean square error of the estimates they produce. Results indicate that the 'I/N' and the adaptive log-linear transformations outperform the others. Guidelines for the application of these transformations are presented.",,D',"Hautus, Michael J.@Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol, Auckland, New Zealand::Lee, Alan@Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol, Auckland, New Zealand","Hautus, Michael J.@University of Auckland::Lee, Alan@University of Auckland","Hautus, Michael@B-5077-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2936-9023","Calculating estimates of sensitivity from group data: Pooled versus averaged estimators+Hautus, MJ+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS INSTRUMENTS &amp; COMPUTERS+NOV 1997::CORRECTIONS FOR EXTREME PROPORTIONS AND THEIR BIASING EFFECTS ON ESTIMATED VALUES OF D'+HAUTUS, MJ+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS INSTRUMENTS &amp; COMPUTERS+FEB 1995::The dispersions of estimates of sensitivity obtained from four psychophysical procedures: Implications for experimental design+Hautus, MJ; Lee, AJ+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+MAY 1998::Statistical properties of d ' and beta estimates of signal detection theory+Kadlec, H+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 1999::no title+Macmillan, N.

Generalized linear models with ordinally-observed covariates,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X65762,NOV 2006,53,4,"An ordinally-observed variable is a variable that is only partially observed through an ordinal surrogate. Although statistical models for ordinally-observed response variables are well known, relatively little attention has been given to the problem of ordinally-observed regressors. In this paper I show that if surrogates to ordinally-observed covariates are used as regressors in a generalized linear model then the resulting measurement error in the covariates can compromise the consistency of point estimators and standard errors for the effects of fully-observed regressors. To properly account for this measurement error when making inferences concerning the fully-observed regressors, I propose a general modelling framework for generalized linear models with ordinally-observed covariates. I discuss issues of model specification, identification, and estimation, and illustrate these with examples.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,MEASUREMENT ERROR,REGRESSION-MODELS,MONTE-CARLO,VARIABLES,DICHOTOMIZATION,ALGORITHMS","Johnson, Timothy R.@Univ Idaho, Dept Stat, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Johnson, Timothy R.@University of Idaho",not exist,"MEASUREMENT ERROR IN THE GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODEL+ARMSTRONG, B+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1985::Type I error inflation in the presence of a ceiling effect+Austin, PC; Brunner, LJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2003::THE CONCEPT OF RESIDUAL CONFOUNDING IN REGRESSION-MODELS AND SOME APPLICATIONS+BECHER, H+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 30 1992::Controlling for continuous confounders in epidemiologic research+Brenner, H; Blettner, M+EPIDEMIOLOGY+JUL 1997::Simulated latent variable estimation of models with ordered categorical data+Breslaw, JA; McIntosh, J+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1998::no title+BURRIDGE J+STAT SCI+1989::no title+Carroll, R.

Multilevel component analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X67599,NOV 2006,42,52,"A general framework for the exploratory component analysis of multilevel data (MLCA) is proposed. In this framework, a separate component model is specified for each group of objects at a certain level. The similarities between the groups of objects at a given level can be expressed by imposing constraints on component models of the groups using the approach adopted in simultaneous component analysis. The constraints used are based on the loading matrices and on the covariances of the component scores of each group. MLCA is related to three-way component analysis and to currently available multilevel structural equation models. It is shown that the latter are less flexible than MLCA.

Recovering stimuli from memory: A statistical method for linking discrimination and reproduction responses,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X73754,NOV 2006,15,1,"Investigations of sensory memory have often relied on discrimination processes: participants judge whether a reference stimulus is identical to a remembered stimulus. Recently, investigators have used response modes, in which participants directly reproduce stimuli. Findings using reproduction tasks have suggested new ways of thinking about biases that pervade psychophysics. To allow an assessment of whether results obtained using reproduction responses persevere for discrimination tasks, this paper presents a statistical model that links the two approaches. The model uses the pattern of discrimination judgements to estimate parameters that represent the means and standard deviations that would have occurred under a reproduction task. An analysis of stimuli that have been previously studied using reproduction responses illustrates the method. Simulations investigate bias and efficiency, large-sample confidence intervals and the performance of likelihood-ratio tests of the adequacy of special submodels.",,"CATEGORIES,JUDGMENT","Vevea, Jack L.@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Psychol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Vevea, Jack L.@University of California System@University of California Santa Cruz",not exist,"TOWARD A UNIFIED THEORY OF SIMILARITY AND RECOGNITION+ASHBY, FG; PERRIN, NA+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+JAN 1988::VARIETIES OF PERCEPTUAL INDEPENDENCE+ASHBY, FG; TOWNSEND, JT+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+APR 1986::Category effects on estimates of stimuli: Perception or reconstruction?+Crawford, LE; Huttenlocher, J; Engebretson, PH+PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE+JUL 2000::no title+FECHNER G+ELEMENTS PSYCHOPHYSI+1966::Why do categories affect stimulus judgment?+Huttenlocher, J; Hedges, LV; Vevea, JL+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL+JUN 2000::CATEGORIES AND PARTICULARS - PROTOTYPE EFFECTS IN ESTIMATING SPATIAL LOCATION+HUTTENLOCHER, J; HEDGES, LV; DUNCAN, S+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+JUL 1991::no title+Knuth, D.

Mood-management dynamics: The interrelationship between moods and behaviours,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X81133,NOV 2006,44,3,"People actively attempt to create and maintain positive moods and to escape from negative moods by engaging in various activities. The principle of homeostasis explains the essence of the mood-management system: adjustments of individuals' moods and activities help maintain constant their conditions of life. We model the dynamics of mood and mood-management behaviour through a pair of interdependent, linear differential equations and estimate the equations using mood and behaviour data collected from an adult panel. Because empirically fitting continuous-time differential equations to intermittent observations is uncommon in the literature, we show how to transform differential equations into equations that can be estimated using simultaneous-equation regression methods. Our adult panel shows strong homeostasis in mood management with mood episodes of several hours and no evidence of endogenous mood cycles.",,"NEGATIVE AFFECT,SELF-REGULATION,MODEL,EXPERIENCE,EPIDEMIOLOGY,PERSONALITY,DEPRESSION,TELEVISION,ATTENTION,STRESS","Hess, James D.@Univ Houston, Dept Mkt, Houston, TX 77204 USA@Univ Cent Florida, Dept Mkt, Orlando, FL 32816 USA::Kacen, Jacqueline J.@Univ Houston, Dept Mkt, Houston, TX 77204 USA@Univ Cent Florida, Dept Mkt, Orlando, FL 32816 USA::Kim, Junyong@Univ Houston, Dept Mkt, Houston, TX 77204 USA@Univ Cent Florida, Dept Mkt, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Hess, James D.@University of Houston@University of Houston System@State University System of Florida@University of Central Florida::Kacen, Jacqueline J.@University of Houston@University of Houston System@State University System of Florida@University of Central Florida::Kim, Junyong@University of Houston@University of Houston System@State University System of Florida@University of Central Florida",not exist,"no title+ANDREWS RL+J MARKETING RES+2002::no title+Bergstrom, A.

Two item response theory models for analysing normative forced-choice personality items,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X64691,NOV 2006,30,1,"This paper proposes two unidimensional item response theory (IRT) models for analysing normative forced-choice personality items. Both models are derived from a common theoretical framework and arise as a result of different assumptions regarding the mechanism of choice. The simplest mechanism gives rise to the one-parameter normal-ogive model. The second mechanism gives rise to a new IRT model, which is closely related to the Coombs-Zinnes probabilistic unfolding model. The second model is compared theoretically to the normal-ogive model in terms of item characteristic curves and amount of item information. Next, procedures for estimating the respondent and the item parameters in the second model are described. Finally, both models are empirically compared by using two well-known personality measures.",,"SENSATION SEEKING,SCALE,ENGLAND,TESTS","Ferrando, Pere J.@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Fac Psicol, Tarragona 43007, Spain","Ferrando, Pere J.@Universitat Rovira i Virgili","Ferrando, Pere@J-9857-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3133-5466","RESIDUAL ANALYSIS IN THE POLYTOMOUS RASCH MODEL+ANDERSEN, EB+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1995::Relationships between the thurstone and Rasch approaches to item scaling+Andrich, D.+Applied Psychological Measurement+1978::no title+Baker, F.+Item response theory: parameter estimation techniques+1992::CONSTRUCT-VALIDATION OF PERSONAL AND SOCIOPOLITICAL DIMENSIONS OF ROTTER INTERNAL-EXTERNAL LOCUS OF CONTROL SCALE+BERNDT, DJ+PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS+1978::Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum,, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::no title+BOCK RD+MEASUREMENT PERSONAL+1985::A DOUBLE LAW OF COMPARATIVE JUDGMENT FOR THE ANALYSIS OF PREFERENTIAL CHOICE AND SIMILARITIES DATA+COOMBS, CH; GREENBERG, M; ZINNES, J+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1961::no title+COOMBS CH+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1948::MEASUREMENT OF PERSONALITY-TRAITS - THEORY AND TECHNIQUE+EDWARDS, AL; ABBOTT, RD+ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY+1973::no title+Edwards, AL.+The Measurement of Personality Traits by Scales and Inventories+1970::CROSS-CULTURAL COMPARISONS OF PERSONALITY - FINLAND AND ENGLAND+EYSENCK, SBG; HAAPASALO, J+PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES+1989::Validities of the Forced-Choice and Questionnaire Methods of Personality Measurement+Gordon, Leonard V.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+DEC 1951::no title+Guilford, J.

Standard errors in covariance structure models: Asymptotics versus bootstrap,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1345/000711005X85896,NOV 2006,51,34,"Commonly used formulae for standard error (SE) estimates in covariance structure analysis are derived under the assumption of a correctly specified model. In practice, a model is at best only an approximation to the real world. It is important to know whether the estimates of SEs as provided by standard software are consistent when a model is misspecified, and to understand why if not. Bootstrap procedures provide nonparametric estimates of SEs that automatically account for distribution violation. It is also necessary to know whether bootstrap estimates of SEs are consistent. This paper studies the relationship between the bootstrap estimates of SEs and those based on asymptotics. Examples are used to illustrate various versions of asymptotic variance-covariance matrices and their validity. Conditions for the consistency of the bootstrap estimates of SEs are identified and discussed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the relationship of different estimates of SEs and covariance matrices.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION,TEST STATISTICS,UNIFIED APPROACH,DISTRIBUTIONS,TESTS,HYPOTHESES,MATRICES","Yuan, Ke-Hai@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA::Hayashi, Kentaro@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA@Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Yuan, Ke-Hai@University of Notre Dame@University of Hawaii System@University of Hawaii Manoa::Hayashi, Kentaro@University of Notre Dame@University of Hawaii System@University of Hawaii Manoa",not exist,"THE ASYMPTOTIC NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION OF ESTIMATORS IN FACTOR-ANALYSIS UNDER GENERAL CONDITIONS+ANDERSON, TW; AMEMIYA, Y+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1988::PSEUDO-MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF MEAN AND COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES WITH MISSING DATA+ARMINGER, G; SOBEL, ME+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1990::PSEUDO MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION AND A TEST FOR MISSPECIFICATION IN MEAN AND COVARIANCE STRUCTURE MODELS+ARMINGER, G; SCHOENBERG, RJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1989::no title+Bentler, P.

Avoiding degeneracy in metric unfolding by penalizing the intercept,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X68507,NOV 2006,20,4,"It has long been thought that degeneracy in unfolding only concerned non-metric unfolding. Recently, Busing, Groenen, and Heiser have established that degeneracy occurs for all transformations that include estimation of an intercept and a slope. Consequently, degeneracy also plagues metric unfolding, since one member of the metric transformation family, the interval transformation, includes estimation of both an intercept and a slope. In this paper, a simple solution is proposed to the degeneracy problem for metric unfolding by penalizing for an undesirable intercept. An application of this approach will illustrate its potential.",,"PROXIMITIES,MODELS","Busing, Frank M. T. A.@Leiden Univ, Dept Psychol, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands","Busing, Frank M. T.

Bayesian item fit analysis for unidimensional item response theory models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X66888,NOV 2006,28,20,"Assessing item fit for unidimensional item response theory models for dichotomous items has always been an issue of enormous interest, but there exists no unanimously agreed item fit diagnostic for these models, and hence there is room for further investigation of the area. This paper employs the posterior predictive model-checking method, a popular Bayesian model-checking tool, to examine item fit for the above-mentioned models. An item fit plot, comparing the observed and predicted proportion-correct scores of examinees with different raw scores, is suggested. This paper also suggests how to obtain posterior predictive p-values (which are natural Bayesian p-values) for the item fit statistics of Orlando and Thissen that summarize numerically the information in the above-mentioned item fit plots. A number of simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested item fit diagnostics. The suggested techniques seem to have adequate power and reasonable Type I error rate, and psychometricians will find them promising.",,"POSTERIOR PREDICTIVE ASSESSMENT,ABILITY,IRT","Sinharay, Sandip@Educ Testing Serv, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA","Sinharay, Sandip@Educational Testing Service (ETS)","Sinharay, Sandip@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4491-8510","Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::ESTIMATING ITEM PARAMETERS AND LATENT ABILITY WHEN RESPONSES ARE SCORED IN 2 OR MORE NOMINAL CATEGORIES+BOCK, RD+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1972::RECONCILING BAYESIAN AND FREQUENTIST EVIDENCE IN THE ONE-SIDED TESTING PROBLEM+CASELLA, G; BERGER, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1987::THE USE OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES IN X2 TESTS FOR GOODNESS OF FIT+CHERNOFF, H; LEHMANN, EL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1954::no title+DONOGHUE JR+ANN M NCME CHIC IL+2003::Statistical significance and effect size in education research: Two sides of a coin+Fan, XT+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH+MAY-JUN 2001::Posterior predictive assessment of model fitness via realized discrepancies+Gelman, A; Meng, XL; Stern, H+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 1996::A Bayesian approach to person fit analysis in item response theory models+Glas, CAW; Meijer, RR+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAY 2003::A comparison of item-fit statistics for the three-parameter logistic model+Glas, CAW; Falcon, JCS+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 2003::no title+Hambleton,, R.

Simple and multiple P-splines regression with shape constraints,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X84293,NOV 2006,22,20,"In many research areas, especially within social and behavioural sciences, the relationship between predictor and criterion variables is often assumed to have a particular shape, such as monotone, single-peaked or U-shaped. Such assumptions can be transformed into (local or global) constraints on the sign of the nth-order derivative of the functional form. To check for such assumptions, we present a non-parametric regression method, P-splines regression, with additional asymmetric discrete penalties enforcing the constraints. We show that the corresponding loss function is convex and present a Newton-Raphson algorithm to optimize. Constrained P-splines are illustrated with an application on monotonicity-constrained regression with both one and two predictor variables, using data from research on the cognitive development of children.",,,"Bollaerts, Kaatje@Univ Hasselt, Ctr Stat, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium@Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands::Eilers, Paul H.

Theoretic statistical results are provided and various extensions of K-means using different metrics or modifications of the original algorithm are given, leading to a unifying treatment of K-means and some of its extensions.

Bootstrap scree tests: A Monte Carlo simulation and applications to published data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X66770,MAY 2006,51,13,"A non-parametric procedure for Cattell's scree test is proposed, using the bootstrap method. Bentler and Yuan developed parametric tests for the linear trend of scree eigenvalues in principal component analysis. The proposed method is for cases where parametric assumptions are not realistic. We define the break in the scree trend in several ways, based on linear slopes defined with two or three consecutive eigenvalues, or all eigenvalues after the k largest. The resulting scree test statistics are evaluated under various data conditions, among which Gorsuch and Nelson's bootstrap CNG performs best and is reasonably consistent and efficient under leptokurtic and skewed conditions. We also examine the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method for these statistics, and the bias correction is found to be too unstable to be useful. Using seven published data sets which Bentler and Yuan analysed, we compare the bootstrap approach to the scree test with the parametric linear trend test.",,"CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,DETERMINING NUMBER,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,LINEAR TREND,COMPONENTS,EIGENVALUES,JACKKNIFE,CRITERIA,REGIONS,RETAIN","Hong, SJ@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada::Mitchell, SK@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada::Harshman, RA@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA@Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada","Hong, SJ@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@Western University (University of Western Ontario)::Mitchell, SK@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@Western University (University of Western Ontario)::Harshman, RA@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@Western University (University of Western Ontario)",not exist,"ASYMPTOTIC THEORY FOR PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS+ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1963::A FURTHER NOTE ON TESTS OF SIGNIFICANCE IN FACTOR ANALYSIS+Bartlett, M.

The use of configural frequency analysis for explorative data analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X66761,MAY 2006,14,5,"Configural frequency analysis (CFA) is a widely used method of explorative data analysis. It tries to detect patterns in the data that occur significantly more or significantly less often than expected by chance. Patterns which occur more often than expected by chance are called CFA types, while those which occur less often than expected by chance are called CFA antitypes. The patterns detected are used to generate knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the data. We investigate the ability of CFA to detect adequate types and antitypes in a number of simulation studies. The basic idea of these studies is to predefine sets of types and antitypes and a mechanism which uses them to create a simulated data set. This simulated data set is then analysed with CFA and the detected types and antitypes are compared to the predefined ones. The predefined types and antitypes together with the method to generate the data are called a data generation model. The results of the simulation studies show that CFA can be used in quite different research contexts to detect structural dependencies in observed data. In addition, we can learn from these simulation studies how much data is necessary to enable CFA to reconstruct the predefined types and antitypes with sufficient accuracy. For one of the data generation models investigated, implicitly underlying knowledge space theory, it was shown that zero-order CFA can be used to reconstruct the predefined types (which can be interpreted in this context as knowledge states) with sufficient accuracy. Theoretical considerations show that first-order CFA cannot be used for this data generation model. Thus, it is wrong to consider first-order CFA, as is done in many publications, as the standard or even only method of CFA.",,KNOWLEDGE,"Schrepp, M@Unknow","Schrepp, M@Unknow",not exist,"no title+ALBERT D+KNOWLEDGE SPACES+1999::SPACES FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF KNOWLEDGE+DOIGNON, JP; FALMAGNE, JC+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MAN-MACHINE STUDIES+1985::A SIMPLE SEQUENTIALLY REJECTIVE MULTIPLE TEST PROCEDURE+HOLM, S+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1979::no title+KRAUTH J+CONFIGURAL FREQUENCY+1973::no title+KRAUTH J+INTRO CONFIGURAL FRE+1993::no title+LAUTSCH E+CONFIGURAL FREQUENCY+1990::A MORE POWERFUL SIMULTANEOUS TEST PROCEDURE IN CONFIGURAL FREQUENCY ANALYSIS+LEHMACHER W+Biometrical Journal+1981::no title+LIENERT GA+CONFIGURAL FREQUENCY+1969::Extracting knowledge structures from observed data+Schrepp, M+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1999::no title+von Eye, A.+Introduction to configural frequency analysis: the search for types and antitypes in cross- classifications+1990::Configural frequency analysis in applied psychological research+vonEye, A; Spiel, C; Wood, PK+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW-PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE+OCT 1996::no title+VONEYE A+EDP MED BIOL+1988::The odds favour antitypes - A comparison of tests for the identification of configural types and antitypes.+vonEye, A.+Methods of Psychological Research Online+2002::no title+VONWEBER S+PSYCHOLOGISCHE BEITR+2000"
Maximal reliability and power in covariance structure models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/00071100SX68183,MAY 2006,18,6,"In covariance structure modelling, the non-centrality parameter of the asymptotic chi-squared distribution is typically used as an indicator of asymptotic power for hypothesis tests. When a latent linear regression is of interest, the contribution to power by the maximal reliability coefficient, which is associated with used latent variable indicators, is examined and this relationship is further explicated in the case of congeneric measures. It is also shown that item parcelling may reduce power of tests of latent regression parameters. Recommendations on weights for parcelling to avoid power loss are provided, which are found to be those of optimal linear composites with maximal reliability.",,,"Penev, S@Univ New S Wales, Dept Stat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia@Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA::Raykov, T@Univ New S Wales, Dept Stat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia@Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Penev, S@University of New South Wales Sydney@Michigan State University::Raykov, T@University of New South Wales Sydney@Michigan State University","Penev, Spiridon@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3669-0010","no title+ANDERSON TW+ITNRO MULTIVARIATE S+1984::no title+BANKALOS DL+NEW DEV TECHNIQUES S+2001::no title+Bartholomew, D.

Testing the Rasch model by means of the mixture fit index,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X72818,MAY 2006,15,3,"Ruclas, Clogg, and Lindsay (RCL) proposed a new index of fit for contingency table analysis. Using the overparametrized two-component mixture, where the first component with weight I - w represents the model to be tested and the second component with weight w is unstructured, the mixture index of fit was defined to be the smallest w compatible with the saturated two-component mixture. This index of fit, which is insensitive to sample size, is applied to the problem of assessing the fit of the Rasch model. In this application, use is made of the equivalence of the semi-parametric version of the Rasch model to specifically restricted latent class models. Therefore, the Rasch model can be represented by the structured component of the RCL mixture, with this component itself consisting of two or more subcomponents corresponding to the classes, and the unstructured component capturing the discrepancies between the data and the model. An empirical example demonstrates the application of this approach. Based on four-item data, the one- and two-class unrestricted latent class models and the one- to three-class models restricted according to the Rasch model are considered, with respect to both their chi-squared statistics and their mixture fit indices.",,"LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS,LOCAL IDENTIFICATION,EFFICIENT ESTIMATION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD","Formann, AK@Univ Vienna, Sch Psychol, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","Formann, AK@University of Vienna",not exist,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION IN GENERALIZED RASCH MODELS+DELEEUW, J; VERHELST, N+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+FAL 1986::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::CONSISTENT ESTIMATION IN THE RASCH MODEL BASED ON NONPARAMETRIC MARGINS+FOLLMANN, D+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1988::Latent class model diagnosis from a frequentist point of view+Formann, AK+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2003::LINEAR LOGISTIC LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS FOR POLYTOMOUS DATA+FORMANN, AK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1992::Linear logistic latent class analysis and the Rasch model+FORMANN, AK+RASCH MODELS: FOUNDATIONS, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, AND APPLICATIONS+1995::Rater agreement and the generalized Rudas-Clogg-Lindsay index of fit+Formann, AK+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 30 2000::EXPLORATORY LATENT STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS USING BOTH IDENTIFIABLE AND UNIDENTIFIABLE MODELS+GOODMAN, LA+BIOMETRIKA+1974::Chapter The American Soldier: Studies in Social Psychology in World War II+LAZARSFELD, P.F.+The logical and mathematical foundations of latent structure analysis+1950::no title+Lazarsfeld, PF; Henry, NW.+Latent Structure Analysis+1968::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION IN THE RASCH MODEL AND RELATED EXPONENTIAL RESPONSE MODELS, INCLUDING A SIMPLE LATENT CLASS MODEL FOR ITEM ANALYSIS+LINDSAY, B; CLOGG, CC; GREGO, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1991::NOTE ON EFFICIENT ESTIMATION AND LOCAL IDENTIFICATION IN LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS+MCHUGH, RB+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1958::EFFICIENT ESTIMATION AND LOCAL IDENTIFICATION IN LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS+MCHUGH, RB+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1956::no title+Rasch, G.+Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests+1960::A NEW INDEX OF FIT BASED ON MIXTURE METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF CONTINGENCY-TABLES+RUDAS, T; CLOGG, CC; LINDSAY, BG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1994"

A single number called the weighted effect size summarizes the differences in population means after weighting each according to the difficulty of estimating their respective means, whether the difficulty is due to unknown population variances, unequal sample sizes or the presence of outliers. For an ANOVA weighted for unequal variances, we find interval estimates for the weighted effect size. In addition, the weighted effect size is shown to be a monotone function of a suitably defined weighted coefficient of determination, which means that interval estimates of the former are readily transformed into interval estimates of the latter.

Generalized reliability estimation using repeated measurements,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X66068,MAY 2006,31,16,"Reliability can be studied in a generalized way using repeated measurements. Linear mixed models are used to derive generalized test-retest reliability measures. The method allows for repeated measures with a different mean structure due to correction for covariate effects. Furthermore, different variance-covariance structures between measurements can be implemented. When the variance structure reduces to a random intercept (compound symmetry), classical methods are recovered. With more complex variance structures (e.g. including random slopes of time and/or serial correlation), time-dependent reliability functions are obtained. The effect of time lag between measurements on reliability estimates can be evaluated.

The following question then may be raised: given a specific data set, which of these models should be selected, and at what complexity (i.e. with how many components)? We address this question by proposing a numerical model selection heuristic based on a convex hull.

Bayesian analysis of structural equation models with mixed exponential family and ordered categorical data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X81403,MAY 2006,47,13,"Structural equation models are very popular for studying relationships among observed and latent variables. However, the existing theory and computer packages are developed mainly under the assumption of normality, and hence cannot be satisfactorily applied to non-normal and ordered categorical data that are common in behavioural, social and psychological research. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach to the analysis of structural equation models in which the manifest variables are ordered categorical and/or from an exponential family. In this framework, models with a mixture of binomial, ordered categorical and normal variables can be analysed. Bayesian estimates of the unknown parameters are obtained by a computational procedure that combines the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Some goodness-of-fit statistics are proposed to evaluate the fit of the posited model. The methodology is illustrated by results obtained from a simulation study and analysis of a real data set about non-adherence of hypertension patients in a medical treatment scheme.",,"LATENT VARIABLE MODELS,POLYTOMOUS DATA,UNKNOWN NUMBER,OUTCOMES,DISTRIBUTIONS,COMPONENTS,INFERENCE,MIXTURES","Lee, SY@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Tang, NS@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Lee, SY@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Tang, NS@Chinese University of Hong Kong","Tang, Niansheng@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7033-3845","ASYMPTOTIC CHI-SQUARE TESTS FOR A LARGE CLASS OF FACTOR-ANALYSIS MODELS+AMEMIYA, Y; ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1990::THE ASYMPTOTIC NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION OF ESTIMATORS IN FACTOR-ANALYSIS UNDER GENERAL CONDITIONS+ANDERSON, TW; AMEMIYA, Y+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1988::Heterogeneous factor analysis models: A Bayesian approach+Ansari, A; Jedidi, K; Dube, L+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2002::Bayesian factor analysis for multilevel binary observations+Ansari, A; Jedidi, K+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2000::no title+BENTLER PM+EQS60 WINDOWS USER G+2002::no title+Bollen, K.

Limited-information goodness-of-fit testing of item response theory models for sparse 2(P) tables,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X66419,MAY 2006,34,59,"Bartholomew and Leung proposed a limited-information goodness-of-fit test statistic (Y) for models fitted to sparse 2(P) contingency tables. The null distribution of Y was approximated using a chi-squared distribution by matching moments. The moments were derived under the assumption that the model parameters were known in advance and it was conjectured that the approximation would also be appropriate when the parameters were to be estimated. Using maximum likelihood estimation of the two-parameter logistic item response theory model, we show that the effect of parameter estimation on the distribution of Y is too large to be ignored. Consequently, we derive the asymptotic moments of Y for maximum likelihood estimation. We show using a simulation study that when the null distribution of Y is approximated using moments that take into account the effect of estimation, Y becomes a very useful statistic to assess the overall goodness of fit of models fitted to sparse 2(P) tables.",,"CONTINGENCY-TABLES,DISTRIBUTIONS,VARIABLES,FULL","Cai, Li@Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA@Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain::Maydeu-Olivares, Albert@Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA@Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain::Coffman, Donna L.@Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA@Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain::Thissen, David@Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA@Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain","Cai, Li@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina@University of Barcelona::Maydeu-Olivares, Albert@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina@University of Barcelona::Coffman, Donna L.@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina@University of Barcelona::Thissen, David@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill@University of North Carolina@University of Barcelona","Maydeu-Olivares, Alberto@B-5178-2010::Coffman, Donna@C-3038-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6305-6579","COMPARING MARGINAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF LARGE, SPARSE CONTINGENCY-TABLES+AGRESTI, A; LIPSITZ, S; LANG, JB+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 1992::AN EMPIRICAL-INVESTIGATION OF SOME EFFECTS OF SPARSENESS IN CONTINGENCY-TABLES+AGRESTI, A; YANG, MC+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 1987::A goodness of fit test for sparse 2(p) contingency tables+Bartholomew, DJ; Leung, SO+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2002::Scaling unobservable constructs in social science+Bartholomew, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1998::no title+Bartholomew, DJ; Knott, M.+Latent variable models and factor analysis+1999::The goodness of fit of latent trait models in attitude measurement+Bartholomew, DJ; Tzamourani, P+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1999::MARGINAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF ITEM PARAMETERS - APPLICATION OF AN EM ALGORITHM+BOCK, RD; AITKIN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1981::no title+BOCK RD+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1970::SOME THEOREMS ON QUADRATIC FORMS APPLIED IN THE STUDY OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE PROBLEMS .1.

Analysing multitrait-multimethod data with structural equation models for ordinal variables applying the WLSMV estimator: What sample size is needed for valid results?,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/00071100SX67490,MAY 2006,31,45,"Convergent and discriminant validity of psychological constructs can best be examined in the framework of multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) analysis. To gain information at the level of single items, MTMM models for categorical variables have to be applied. The CTC(M-1) model is presented as an example of an MTMM model for ordinal variables. Based on an empirical application of the CTC(M-1) model, a complex simulation study was conducted to examine the sample size requirements of the robust weighted least squares mean- and variance-adjusted chi(2) test of model fit (WLSMV estimator) implemented in Mplus. In particular, the simulation study analysed the chi(2) approximation, the parameter estimation bias, the standard error bias, and the reliability of the WLSMV estimator depending on the varying number of items per trait-method unit (ranging from 2 to 8) and varying sample sizes (250, 500, 750, and 1000 observations). The results howed that the WLSMV estimator provided a good - albeit slightly liberal chi(2) approximation and stable and reliable parameter estimates for models of reasonable complexity (2-4 items) and small sample sizes (at least 250 observations). When more complex models with 5 or more items were analysed, larger sample sizes of at least 500 observations were needed. The most complex model with 9 trait-method units and 8 items (72 observed variables) requires sample sizes of at least 1000 observations.",,"CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS,PERSONALITY","Nussbeck, FW@Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland::Eid, M@Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland::Lischetzke, T@Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Nussbeck, FW@University of Geneva::Eid, M@University of Geneva::Lischetzke, T@University of Geneva","Nussbeck, Fridtjof@I-8938-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4002-8916","no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::ASYMPTOTICALLY DISTRIBUTION-FREE METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES+BROWNE, MW+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1984::CONVERGENT AND DISCRIMINANT VALIDATION BY THE MULTITRAIT-MULTIMETHOD MATRIX+CAMPBELL, DT; FISKE, DW+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1959::Estimates and tests in structural equation modeling+Chou, C.

Initial loadings and components are extracted using principal component analysis. Rotating the components towards independence rather than rotating the loadings towards simplicity allows one to accurately recover the dimensions of each box and also produce simple loadings. It is shown how this may be done using an appropriate rotation criterion and a general rotation algorithm. Methods from independent component analysis are used, and this paper may be viewed as an introduction to independent component analysis from the perspective of factor analysis.",,,"Jennrich, RI@Open Univ, Dept Stat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Math, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA::Trendafilov, N@Open Univ, Dept Stat, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Math, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Jennrich, RI@Open University - UK@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System::Trendafilov, N@Open University - UK@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System","Trendafilov, Nickolay@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9309-1375","Kernel independent component analysis+Bach, FR; Jordan, MI.+J.

Computerized adaptive testing: A mixture item selection approach for constrained situations,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X62945,NOV 2005,31,11,"in computerized adaptive testing (CAT), traditionally the most discriminating items are selected to provide the maximum information so as to attain the highest efficiency in trait (theta) estimation. The maximum information (MI) approach typically results in unbalanced item exposure and hence high item-overlap rates across examinees. Recently, Yi and Chang (2003) proposed the multiple stratification (MS) method to remedy the shortcomings of MI. In MS, items are first sorted according to content, then difficulty and finally discrimination parameters. As discriminating items are used strategically, MS offers a better utilization of the entire item pool. However, for testing with imposed non-statistical constraints, this new stratification approach may not maintain its high efficiency. Through a series of simulation studies, this research explored the possible benefits of a mixture item selection approach (MS-MI), integrating the MS and MI approaches, in testing with non-statistical constraints. In all simulation conditions, MS consistently outperformed the other two competing approaches in item pool utilization, while the MS-MI and the MI approaches yielded higher measurement efficiency and offered better conformity to the constraints. Furthermore, the MS-MI approach was shown to perform better than MI on all evaluation criteria when control of item exposure was imposed.",,"ABILITY,BLOCKING,DESIGN","Leung, CK@Hong Kong Inst Educ, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Chang, HH@Hong Kong Inst Educ, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Hau, KT@Hong Kong Inst Educ, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Leung, CK@Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK)@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Chang, HH@Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK)@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Hau, KT@Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK)@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign@Chinese University of Hong Kong","Hau, Kit-Tai@K-2995-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4065-1855","The role of parametric assumptions in adaptive Bayesian estimation+Alcala-Quintana, R; Garcia-Perez, MA+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+JUN 2004::IRT test assembly using network-flow programming+Armstrong, RD; Jones, DH+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1998::no title+CHANG H+APPL PSYCH MEAS+1999::a-stratified multistage computerized adaptive testing with b blocking+Chang, HH; Qian, JH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 2001::A global information approach to computerized adoptive testing+Chang, HH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1996::New algorithms for item selection and exposure control with computerized adaptive testing+Davey, T; Parshall, CG.+ANN M AM ED RES ASS+1995::Case studies in computer adaptive test design through simulation+Eignor, D.

On measuring the minimum detection time: A simple reaction time study in the time estimation paradigm,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X62774,NOV 2005,38,3,"Kornblum's time estimation paradigm, together with the so-called 'race model', provides an appealing alternative for measuring the 'cut-off' which separates 'true' reaction times from anticipatory reaction times. However, the model is not precise enough to reveal the relation between the signal intensity and the 'cut-off'. Accordingly, Kornblum's model is extended with an emphasis on the measure of the 'cut-off'. Another aspect of the extension is to use a parametric method to analyse the data. In particular, it is assumed that the time estimation-induced latency is gamma distributed and the signal-induced latency is Weibull distributed, with the latter shifted by the 'cut-off'. The rationale behind the parametric assumption is discussed. For illustrative purposes, two pieces of experimental work are presented. Since the core of the race model is the assumption of an independent race between the time estimation process and the detection process, the first experiment tests whether, for the same signal intensity, the signal-induced latency distribution is invariant across different time intervals; the second experiment tests whether, for the same time interval, the time estimation-induced latency distribution is invariant across different signal intensity conditions. The data from the second experiment are also used to test various parametric assumptions in the model, which include the signal effect on the 'cut-off'. The new model fits the data well.",,"CHOICE-REACTION-TIME,SPEED ACCURACY DECOMPOSITION,WEAK TEST LIGHTS,STIMULUS-INTENSITY,INSTANCE THEORY,RESPONSE FORCE,MODEL,RACE,DISTRIBUTIONS,PROBABILITIES","Hsu, YF@Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Psychol, Taipei, Taiwan","Hsu, YF@National Taiwan University","HSU, YUNG-FONG@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5193-9718","no title+Brent, R.+Algorithms for minimization without derivatives+1973::THE INSTANCE THEORY OF AUTOMATICITY - WHY THE WEIBULL+COLONIUS, H+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+OCT 1995::Extending statistics of extremes to distributions varying in position and scale and the implications for race models+Cousineau, D; Goodman, VW; Shiffrin, RM+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+AUG 2002::PARTIAL INFORMATION OR FACILITATION - DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF RESULTS FROM SPEED ACCURACY DECOMPOSITION+DEJONG, R+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+OCT 1991::THE STRUCTURE OF SIMPLE REACTION-TIME TO STEP-FUNCTION SIGNALS+DZHAFAROV, EN+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+JUN 1992::ANALYSIS OF SIMPLE REACTION-TIME TO A SINUSOIDAL GRATING BY MEANS OF A LINEAR FILTER MODEL OF THE DETECTION PROCESS+EJIMA, Y; OHTANI, Y+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+AUG 1989::no title+GEGENFURTNER KR+BEHAV RES METH INSTR+1993::no title+HSU YF+IN PRESS J MATH PSYC+no time::no title+HSU YF+UNPUB NOTE POWER FUN+2000::no title+INDOW T+BEHAVIORMETRIKA+1993::no title+INDOW T+WEIBULL FORM MEMORY+1995::SIMPLE REACTION-TIME AS A RACE BETWEEN SIGNAL-DETECTION AND TIME ESTIMATION - PARADIGM AND MODEL+KORNBLUM, S+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+1973::VARIATION IN RESPONSE LATENCY OF CAT RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS+LEVICK, WR+VISION RESEARCH+1973::SHAPES OF REACTION-TIME DISTRIBUTIONS AND SHAPES OF LEARNING-CURVES - A TEST OF THE INSTANCE THEORY OF AUTOMATICITY+LOGAN, GD+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION+SEP 1992::ON THE ABILITY TO INHIBIT THOUGHT AND ACTION - A THEORY OF AN ACT OF CONTROL+LOGAN, GD; COWAN, WB+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+1984::no title+Luce, RD.+Response times: their role in inferring elementary mental organization+1986::A MODEL OF A SINGLE VISUAL CHANNELS RESPONSE TO WEAK TEST LIGHTS+MALONEY, LT; WANDELL, BA+VISION RESEARCH+1984::LATENCY FUNCTIONS IN HUMAN VISION+MANSFIELD, RJ+VISION RESEARCH+1973::A RANDOM UTILITY FAMILY THAT INCLUDES MANY OF THE CLASSICAL-MODELS AND HAS CLOSED FORM CHOICE-PROBABILITIES AND CHOICE REACTION-TIMES+MARLEY, AAJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1989::THE HORSE RACE RANDOM UTILITY MODEL FOR CHOICE-PROBABILITIES AND REACTION-TIMES, AND ITS COMPETING RISKS INTERPRETATION+MARLEY, AAJ; COLONIUS, H+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAR 1992::no title+MCGILL WJ+HANDB MATH+1963::THE DYNAMICS OF COGNITION AND ACTION - MENTAL PROCESSES INFERRED FROM SPEED ACCURACY DECOMPOSITION+MEYER, DE; OSMAN, AM; IRWIN, DE; et al.+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+APR 1988::STIMULUS-INTENSITY AND INFORMATION-PROCESSING+NISSEN, MJ+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+1977::no title+OLLMAN RT+ATTENTION PERFORM+1973::DEADLINE MODEL FOR SIMPLE REACTION TIMES+OLLMAN, RT; BILLINGT.MJ+COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY+1972::THE POINT-OF-NO-RETURN IN CHOICE REACTION-TIME - CONTROLLED AND BALLISTIC STAGES OF RESPONSE PREPARATION+OSMAN, A; KORNBLUM, S; MEYER, DE+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE+AUG 1986::no title+Pieron, H.+The Sensations: their functions, processes and mechanisms+1952::On the relation between stimulus intensity and processing time: Pieron's law and choice reaction time+Pins, D; Bonnet, C+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+APR 1996::PSYCHOPHYSICALLY PRINCIPLED MODELS OF VISUAL SIMPLE REACTION-TIME+SMITH, PL+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+JUL 1995::SOME EXPERIMENTS ON SIMPLE AND CHOICE REACTION TIME+SNODGRAS.JG; LUCE, R, RD; GALANTER, E+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY+1967::EFFECTS OF TRUNCATION ON REACTION-TIME ANALYSIS+ULRICH, R; MILLER, J+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL+MAR 1994::Effects of stimulus duration and intensity on simple reaction time and response force+Ulrich, R; Rinkenauer, G; Miller, J+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE+JUN 1998::Motor programming of response force and movement direction+Ulrich, R; Leuthold, H; Sommer, W+PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY+NOV 1998::STATISTICAL MIMICKING OF REACTION-TIME DATA - SINGLE-PROCESS MODELS, PARAMETER VARIABILITY, AND MIXTURES+VANZANDT, T; RATCLIFF, R+PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN &amp; REVIEW+MAR 1995::FUNCTIONAL RELATION OF VISUAL EVOKED RESPONSE AND REACTION TIME TO STIMULUS INTENSITY+VAUGHAN, HG; COSTA, LD; GILDEN, L+VISION RESEARCH+1966::REACTION-TIMES TO WEAK TEST LIGHTS+WANDELL, BA; AHUMADA, P; WELSH, D+VISION RESEARCH+1984::no title+Woodworth, R.

However, when the partition-diameter criterion is used, there is often a myriad of alternative optimal solutions that can vary significantly with respect to their substantive interpretation. We propose a bicriterion partitioning approach that considers both diameter and within-cluster sums in the optimization problem and facilitates selection from among the alternative optima. We developed several MATLAB-based exchange algorithms that rapidly provide excellent solutions to bicriterion partitioning problems.

In this research note, we propose a bicriterion approach for seriation of a skew-symmetric matrix incorporating both sign and magnitude information.

Influence curves for factor loadings,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X66923,NOV 2005,27,1,Influence curves for the initial and rotated loadings are derived for the maximum likelihood factor analysis (MLFA) model. Cook's distances based on the empirical influence curves of factor loadings are proposed for the identification of influential observations. The distances are shown to be invariant under scale transformation and factor rotation. We find that an observation with a very large Cook's distance based on the sample influence curve may not necessarily exert an excessive influence on the factor loadings pattern but may change the ordering of the factors. The issue of the switching of factors is also studied by means of the empirical influence curve and factor scores.,,"LIKELIHOOD FACTOR-ANALYSIS,EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS,STANDARD ERRORS,SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS,LOCAL INFLUENCE,DIAGNOSTICS,MODELS","Kwan, CW@Univ Hong Kong, Clin Trials Ctr, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Fung, WK@Univ Hong Kong, Clin Trials Ctr, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Kwan, CW@University of Hong Kong@University of Hong Kong::Fung, WK@University of Hong Kong@University of Hong Kong",not exist,"no title+Anderson, T.+An Introdiction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+1984::STANDARD ERRORS FOR ROTATED FACTOR LOADINGS+ARCHER, CO; JENNRICH, RI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1973::SENSITIVITY MEASURES OF INFLUENCE ON THE LOADING MATRIX IN EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS+CASTANOTOSTADO, E; TANAKA, Y+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1991::no title+Cook, R.

Fitting the factor analysis model to the sample correlation matrix is a complex matrix optimization problem which requires the structure preservation of the unknown parameters (e.g. positive definiteness). The projected gradient approach is a natural way of solving such data matching problems as especially designed to follow the geometry of the model parameters. Two reparameterizations of the factor analysis model are considered. The approach leads to globally convergent procedures for simultaneous estimation of the factor analysis matrix parameters.

Estimating population or group sensitivity and its precision from a set of individual d',BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X38357,MAY 2005,26,5,"A commonly used method of estimating population sensitivity is the so-called averaged d' method. In this method, the arithmetic mean of a set of individual d' is usually taken as a population sensitivity estimator. This practice ignores the fact that the individual d, itself is an estimator with an inherent variance. For observations with different levels of precision, the arithmetic mean is not the best estimator of a population parameter. It may lead to an estimate with a large variation. Another fact, which is often ignored, is that the variance of individual d involves both between- and within-subject variations in a random effects model when population sensitivity and its level of precision are estimated. Failing to account for both components of variance leads to an underestimate of variation and an overestimate of precision for the estimator. In this paper a lognormal distribution rather than a normal distribution is assumed for individual sensitivity. An iterative weighting procedure is proposed for estimating population sensitivity on the log scale on the basis of a random effects model. An ordinary weighting procedure is proposed for estimating group sensitivity on the log scale on the basis of a fixed effects model.

A statistical model for binocular rivalry,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X38708,MAY 2005,31,2,"au`A probabilistic model is presented for the phase durations in binocular rivalry experiments. The hypothetical construct of inhibition or reaction inhibition is used to account for the length of the successive phases of left-eye dominance and right-eye dominance. In accordance with Hull's Postulate X.B. it is assumed that the inhibition increases linearly at rate a, during periods of left-eye dominance and decreases linearly at rate a(0) during periods of right-eye dominance. Two different versions of the proposed model are presented: the beta and the Bessel inhibition models. Inhibition fluctuates between the boundaries 0 and 1 in the beta inhibition model and between -infinity and +infinity in the Bessel inhibition model. The transition rates lambda(1)(t) for switches from a state of left-eye dominance to a state of right-eye dominance, and lambda(0)(t) for switches from a state of right-eye dominance to a state of left-eye dominance depend on inhibition: lambda(1) (t) = I-1 (Y(t)), lambda(0)(t) = I-0(Y(t)), where I-1 is a non-decreasing function and I-0 is a nonincreasing function. In the beta inhibition model I-1 (y) = c(1)/(I - y) and I-0(y) = c(0)/y. In the Bessel inhibition model I-1 (y) = u(1)e(y) and I-0(y) = u(0)/e(y). Special attention is given to the derivation of the expectation of the stationary phase durations.",,"SUPPRESSION,INHIBITION,TESTS,SPEED","van der Ven, AHGS@Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Ctr Study Giftedness, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands@Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Dept Psychol, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands@Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Dept Math, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands::Gremmen, FM@Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Ctr Study Giftedness, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands@Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Dept Psychol, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands@Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Dept Math, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands::Smit, JC@Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Ctr Study Giftedness, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands@Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Dept Psychol, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands@Univ Nijmegen St Radboud Hosp, Dept Math, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands","van der Ven, AHGS@Radboud University Nijmegen@Radboud University Nijmegen@Radboud University Nijmegen::Gremmen, FM@Radboud University Nijmegen@Radboud University Nijmegen@Radboud University Nijmegen::Smit, JC@Radboud University Nijmegen@Radboud University Nijmegen@Radboud University Nijmegen","Ven, A.J.A.M.@H-8102-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1833-3391","The Predictive Validity of Herbart's Mathematical Psychology+BANDOMIR, DJ.+Psychologie et Histoire+2002::THRESHOLD CONDITIONS FOR BINOCULAR-RIVALRY+BLAKE, R+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE+1977::A NEURAL THEORY OF BINOCULAR-RIVALRY+BLAKE, R+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+JAN 1989::A TEST OF LEVELT 2ND PROPOSITION FOR BINOCULAR-RIVALRY+BOSSINK, CJH; STALMEIER, PFM; DEWEERT, CMM+VISION RESEARCH+JUL 1993::Herbart's mathematical psychology.+Boudewijnse, G J; Murray, D J; Bandomir, C A+History of psychology+1999-Aug::On inhibition+Breese, B.

Latent variable models for partially ordered responses and trajectory analysis of anger-related feelings,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711005X38555,MAY 2005,49,4,"A general framework is presented for the analysis of partially ordered set (poset) data. The work is motivated by the need to analyse poset data such as multi-componential responses in psychological measurement and partially accomplished cognitive tasks in educational measurement. It is shown how the generalized loglinear model can be used to represent poset data that form a lattice and how latent-variable models can be constructed by further specifying the canonical parameters of the loglinear representation. The approach generalizes a class of latent-variable models for completely ordered data. We apply the methods to analyse data on the frequency and intensity of anger-related feelings. Furthermore, we propose a trajectory analysis to gain insight into the response function of partially ordered emotional states.",,"PARTIAL CREDIT MODEL,CATEGORIES,FREQUENCY,INTENSITY,INVENTORY","Meulders, M@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA::Ip, EH@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA::De Boeck, P@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA","Meulders, M@KU Leuven@Wake Forest University::Ip, EH@KU Leuven@Wake Forest University::De Boeck, P@KU Leuven@Wake Forest University","De Boeck, Paul@L-3508-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0884-2582::Meulders, Michel@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7042-6849","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::no title+Aigner, M.+Combinatorial Theory+1979::Information Theory and an Extension of the Maximum Likelihood Principle+AKAIKE, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR BU+1973::RATING FORMULATION FOR ORDERED RESPONSE CATEGORIES+ANDRICH, D+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1978::no title+Berge, C.+Principles of combinatorics+1971::ESTIMATING ITEM PARAMETERS AND LATENT ABILITY WHEN RESPONSES ARE SCORED IN 2 OR MORE NOMINAL CATEGORIES+BOCK, RD+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1972::DOMAINS AND FACETS - HIERARCHICAL PERSONALITY-ASSESSMENT USING THE REVISED NEO PERSONALITY-INVENTORY+COSTA, PT; MCCRAE, RR+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT+FEB 1995::ANALYSIS OF MULTIVARIATE BINARY DATA+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1972::THE PERSONALITY STRUCTURE OF AFFECT+DIENER, E; SMITH, H; FUJITA, F+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+JUL 1995::INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY - DIMENSIONS UNDERLYING POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT+DIENER, E; LARSEN, RJ; LEVINE, S; et al.+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+1985::STAGE-RELATED PROPERTIES OF COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT+FLAVELL, JH+COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY+1971::no title+Gelman,, A.; Carlin, J.

A method for testing group differences of scale validity in multiple population studies,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/00071105X38005,MAY 2005,15,2,A method for testing equality in validity of multi-component measuring instruments across populations is outlined. The approach is developed within the framework of covariance structure modelling and complements earlier research on examining group differences in scale reliability. The procedure is particularly useful for purposes of ascertaining comparability of validity when constructing and developing measuring instruments. The method also provides ranges of plausible values for differences in composite validity across several populations and allows one to evaluate group discrepancies in validity of behavioural scales. The approach is illustrated using data from a cognitive intervention study.,,RELIABILITY,"Raykov, T@Fordham Univ, Dept Psychol, Bronx, NY 10458 USA","Raykov, T@Fordham University",not exist,"Validity: an evolving concept+Angoff, WH.+Test Validity+1988::Reserve capacity of the elderly in aging-sensitive tests of fluid intelligence: replication and extension.+Baltes, P B; Dittmann-Kohli, F; Kliegl, R+Psychology and aging+1986-Jun::no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::no title+Crocker, L.; Algina, J.+Introduction to classical and modern test theory+1986::no title+Hays, W.

Statistical inference and Aristotle's Rhetoric,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/0007110042307186,NOV 2004,26,4,"Formal logic operates in a closed system where all the information relevant to any conclusion is present, whereas this is not the case when one reasons about events and states of the world. Pollard and Richardson drew attention to the fact that the reasoning behind statistical tests does not lead to logically justifiable conclusions. In this paper statistical inferences are defended not by logic but by the standards of everyday reasoning. Aristotle invented formal logic, but argued that people mostly get at the truth with the aid of enthymemes-incomplete syllogisms which include arguing from examples, analogies and signs. It is proposed that statistical tests work in the same way-in that they are based on examples, invoke the analogy of a model and use the size of the effect under test as a sign that the chance hypothesis is unlikely. Of existing theories of statistical inference only a weak version of Fisher's takes this into account. Aristotle anticipated Fisher by producing an argument of the form that there were too many cases in which an outcome went in a particular direction for that direction to be plausibly attributed to chance. We can therefore conclude that Aristotle would have approved of statistical inference and there is a good reason for calling this form of statistical inference classical.",,PROBABILITY,"Macdonald, RR@Univ Stirling, Dept Psychol, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland","Macdonald, RR@University of Stirling","Rohlf, F@A-8710-2008","no title+Abelson, R.+Statistics as principled argument+1995::no title+Barlow, RE; Bartholomew, DJ; Bremner, JM<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Brunk, HD</span>.+Statistical Inference under Order Restriction: Theory and Application of Isotonic Regression+1972::no title+Billig, Michael.+Arguing and thinking: A rhetorical approach to social psychology+1996::THE EARTH IS ROUND (P-LESS-THAN.05)+COHEN, J+AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST+DEC 1994::no title+CORBETT EPJ+CLASSICAL RHETORIC M+1965::no title+De Finetti, B.+Probability, induction, and statistics+1972::no title+Edwards, AWF.+Likelihood+1992::Murder and (of?) the likelihood principle: a trialogue+Edwards, W.; Schum, D.A.; Winkler, R.L.+Journal of Behavioral Decision Making+April-June 1990::no title+Fisher, R.

A multivariate projection-type analogue of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/0007110042307212,NOV 2004,12,0,"The problem of comparing two independent groups based on mulitivariate data is considered. Many such methods have been proposed, but it is difficult to gain a perspective on the extent to which the groups differ. The basic strategy here is to determine a robust measure of location for each group, project the data onto the line connecting these measures of location, and then compare the groups based on the ordering of the projected points. In the univariate case the method uses the same measure of effect size employed by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Under general conditions, the projected points are dependent, causing difficulties when testing hypotheses. Two methods are found to be effective when trying to avoid Type I error probabilities above the nominal level. The relative merits of the two methods are discussed. The projected data provide not only a useful (numerical) measure of effect size, but also a graphical indication of the extent to which groups differ.",,LOCATION,"Wilcox, RR@Univ So Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Wilcox, RR@University of Southern California","Wilcox, Rand@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2524-2976","no title+Brunner, E.; Domhof, S.; Langer, F.+Nonparametric analysis of longitudinal data in factorial experiments+2002::An approach to multivariate rank tests in multivariate analysis of variance+Choi, K; Marden, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::no title+Cliff, N.+Ordinal Methods for Behavioral Data Analysis+1996::BREAKDOWN PROPERTIES OF LOCATION ESTIMATES BASED ON HALF-SPACE DEPTH AND PROJECTED OUTLYINGNESS+DONOHO, DL; GASKO, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1992::no title+Hettmansperger, T.

Comparing measures of the 'typical' score across treatment groups,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/0007110042307159,NOV 2004,51,14,"Researchers can adopt one of many different measures of central tendency to examine the effect of a treatment variable across groups. These include least squares means, trimmed means, M-estimators and medians. In addition, some methods begin with a preliminary test to determine the shapes of distributions before adopting a particular estimator of the typical score. We compared a number of recently developed adaptive robust methods with respect to their ability to, control Type I error and their sensitivity to detect differences between the groups when data were non-normal and heterogeneous, and the design was unbalanced. In particular, two new approaches to comparing the typical score across treatment groups, due to Babu, Padmanabhan, and Puri, were compared to two new methods presented by Wilcox and by Keselman, Wilcox, Othman, and Fradette. The procedures examined generally resulted in good Type I error control and therefore, on the basis of this critetion, it would be difficult to recommend one method over the other. However, the power results clearly favour one of the methods presented by Wilcox and Keselman; indeed, in the vast majority of the cases investigated, this most favoured approach had substantially larger power values than the other procedures, particularly when there were more than two treatment groups.",,"ONE-WAY ANOVA,TRIMMED MEANS,POPULATION VARIANCES,ROBUST ESTIMATORS,TESTS,EQUALITY,BOOTSTRAP,WORK","Othman, AR@Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Distance Educ, Math Sci Program, George Town 11800, Malaysia@Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia@Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA::Keselman, HJ@Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Distance Educ, Math Sci Program, George Town 11800, Malaysia@Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia@Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA::Padmanabhan, AR@Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Distance Educ, Math Sci Program, George Town 11800, Malaysia@Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia@Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA::Wilcox, RR@Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Distance Educ, Math Sci Program, George Town 11800, Malaysia@Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia@Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA::Fradette, K@Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Distance Educ, Math Sci Program, George Town 11800, Malaysia@Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada@Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia@Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Othman, AR@Universiti Sains Malaysia@University of Manitoba@Monash University@University of Southern California::Keselman, HJ@Universiti Sains Malaysia@University of Manitoba@Monash University@University of Southern California::Padmanabhan, AR@Universiti Sains Malaysia@University of Manitoba@Monash University@University of Southern California::Wilcox, RR@Universiti Sains Malaysia@University of Manitoba@Monash University@University of Southern California::Fradette, K@Universiti Sains Malaysia@University of Manitoba@Monash University@University of Southern California","Othman, Abdul Rahman@C-1117-2008::Wilcox, Rand@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2524-2976","Robust one-way ANOVA under possibly non-regular conditions+Babu, GJ; Padmanabhan, AR; Puri, ML+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1999::ON A SIMPLE ESTIMATE OF RECIPROCAL OF DENSITY FUNCTION+BLOCH, DA; GASTWIRT.JL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1968::ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::no title+Cohen, J.+Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences+1969::no title+David, H.

In the correlation of a naturally and an artificially dichotomized variable,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/0007110042307203,NOV 2004,36,10,"A method is suggested for estimating the correlation of a naturally (X) and an artificially (Y) dichotomized variable. It is assumed that a normal random variable (L) underlies the artificially dichotomized variable. The proposed correlation coefficient recovers the product moment correlation coefficient between X and L from a fourfold table of X and Y The suggested correlation coefficient nu is contrasted with the phi correlation and the biserial eta. The biserial eta was proposed by Karl Pearson and is conceptually related to the new correlation coefficient. However, in addition, Pearson's biserial eta invokes the assumption that the marginal distribution of L is normal, which contradicts its basic assumptions and thus does not recover the true correlation of L and X. Finally, an approximation is provided to simplify the calculation of nu and its standard error.",,"MODERATED MULTIPLE-REGRESSION,CORRELATION-COEFFICIENTS,POWER","Ulrich, R@Univ Tubingen, Inst Psychol, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany@Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany::Wirtz, M@Univ Tubingen, Inst Psychol, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany@Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany","Ulrich, R@Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen@University of Freiburg::Wirtz, M@Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen@University of Freiburg","Ulrich, Rolf@A-9372-2012","STATISTICAL POWER PROBLEMS WITH MODERATED MULTIPLE-REGRESSION IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH+AGUINIS, H+JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT+1995::no title+Bortz, J.; Doting, N.+Forschungsmethoden und Evaluation+2001::no title+BORTZ J+LEHRBUCH STAT SOZIAL+1979::Algorithm AS 116.

Some results on extensions and modifications of the Theii-Sen regression estimator,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/0007110042307230,NOV 2004,39,13,"Many robust regression estimators have been proposed that have a high, finite-sample breakdown point, roughly meaning that a large porportion of points must be altered to drive the value of an estimator to infinity. But despite this, many of them can be inordinately influenced by two properly placed outliers. With one predictor, an estimator that appears to correct this problem to a fair degree, and simultaneously maintain good efficiency when standard assumptions are met, consists of checking for outliers using a projection-type method, removing any that are found, and applying the Theil-Sen estimator to the data that remain. When dealing with multiple predictors, there are two generalizations of the Theil-Sen estimator that might be used, but nothing is known about how their small-sample properties compare. Also, there are no results on testing the hypothesis of zero slopes, and there is no information about the effect on efficiency when outliers are removed. In terms of hypothesis testing, using the more obvious percentile bootstrap method in conjunction with a slight modification of Mahalanobis distance was found to avoid Type I error probabilities above the nominal level, but in some situations the actual Type I error probabilities can be substantially smaller than intended when the sample size is small. An alternative method is found to be more satisfactory.",,"MULTIVARIATE OUTLIERS,LEVERAGE POINTS,DATA DEPTH,ROBUST,LOCATION,STATISTICS","Wilcox, RR@Univ So Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Wilcox, RR@University of Southern California","Wilcox, Rand@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2524-2976","THE THEIL-SEN ESTIMATOR WITH DOUBLY CENSORED-DATA AND APPLICATIONS TO ASTRONOMY+AKRITAS, MG; MURPHY, SA; LAVALLEY, MP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1995::Resistant outlier rules and the non-Gaussian case+Carling, K+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 28 2000::no title+Dahlquist, G.; Bjorck, A.; Anderson, N.+Numerical Methods+1974::ASYMPTOTIC-BEHAVIOR OF S-ESTIMATES OF MULTIVARIATE LOCATION PARAMETERS AND DISPERSION MATRICES+DAVIES, PL+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1987::TEACHING REGRESSION IN A NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS COURSE+DIETZ, EJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1989::A COMPARISON OF ROBUST ESTIMATORS IN SIMPLE LINEAR-REGRESSION+DIETZ, EJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1987::no title+Donoho, D.L.+Breakdown properties of multivariate location estimators+1982::BREAKDOWN PROPERTIES OF LOCATION ESTIMATES BASED ON HALF-SPACE DEPTH AND PROJECTED OUTLYINGNESS+DONOHO, DL; GASKO, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1992::CHERRY TREES WITH CONES+FAIRLEY, D+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1986::UNMASKING OUTLIERS AND LEVERAGE POINTS - A CONFIRMATION+FUNG, WK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::A class of robust and fully efficient regression estimators+Gervini, D; Yohai, VJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2002::no title+Golub, G.

The proposed model has a proportionality parameter for the speed of each test taker, for the time intensity of each item, and for subject or item characteristics of interest. It is shown how all these parameters can be estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Gibbs sampling). The performance of the estimation procedure is assessed with simulations and the model is further illustrated with the analysis of response times from a visual recognition task.","frailty model,semi-parametric proportional hazards model,response time,Bayesian estimation,crossed random effects","FRAMEWORK,ACCURACY,SPEED,HETEROGENEITY,DISTRIBUTIONS,TRUNCATION,REGRESSION,FRAILTY","Loeys, Tom@Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium::Legrand, Catherine@Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium::Schettino, Antonio@Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium@Univ Leipzig, Inst Psychol, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany::Pourtois, Gilles@Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Loeys, Tom@Ghent University::Legrand, Catherine@Unknow::Schettino, Antonio@Ghent University@University of Leipzig::Pourtois, Gilles@Ghent University","Schettino, Antonio@H-8675-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8065-6082","Comparison of different estimation procedures for proportional hazards model with random effects+Abrahantes, J.

We present a method for inspecting and rating all linear partitions of a finite set, and a package of three functions in the R language for executing the computations. One function is for finding the optimal linear partitions and corresponding separating lines, another for graphically representing the results, and a third for testing how well the data comply with the linear separability condition. We illustrate the method on possible data from a psychophysical experiment (concerning the size-weight illusion) and compare its performance with that of linear discriminant analysis and multiple logistic regression, adapted to dividing linearly a set of points on the plane.",,"SIZE-WEIGHT ILLUSION,DECISION RULES,CATEGORIZATION,MODEL,INFORMATION","Burigana, Luigi@Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, I-35131 Padua, Italy::Martino, Francesco@Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, I-35131 Padua, Italy::Vicovaro, Michele@Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, I-35131 Padua, Italy","Burigana, Luigi@University of Padua::Martino, Francesco@University of Padua::Vicovaro, Michele@University of Padua","Burigana, Luigi@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9898-8317","AVERAGING MODEL APPLIED TO SIZE-WEIGHT ILLUSION+ANDERSON, NH+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+1970::COMPLEX DECISION RULES IN CATEGORIZATION - CONTRASTING NOVICE AND EXPERIENCED PERFORMANCE+ASHBY, FG; MADDOX, WT+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE+FEB 1992::INTEGRATING INFORMATION FROM SEPARABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS+ASHBY, FG; MADDOX, WT+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE+AUG 1990::DECISION RULES IN THE PERCEPTION AND CATEGORIZATION OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL STIMULI+ASHBY, FG; GOTT, RE+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION+JAN 1988::SCALE-FREE TESTS OF AN ADDITIVE MODEL FOR SIZE-WEIGHT ILLUSION+BIRNBAUM, MH; VEIT, CT+PERCEPTION &amp; PSYCHOPHYSICS+1974::no title+CLARK JJ+DATA FUSION SENSORY+1990::no title+Cristianini, N.; Shawe-Taylor, J.+An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-Based Learning Methods+2000::no title+Dobson,, A.

How the 2SLS/IV estimator can handle equality constraints in structural equation models: A system-of-equations approach,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12023,MAY 2014,22,7,"Parameters in structural equation models are typically estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) approach. Bollen (1996) proposed an alternative non-iterative, equation-by-equation estimator that uses instrumental variables. Although this two-stage least squares/instrumental variables (2SLS/IV) estimator has good statistical properties, one problem with its application is that parameter equality constraints cannot be imposed. This paper presents a mathematical solution to this problem that is based on an extension of the 2SLS/IV approach to a system of equations. We present an example in which our approach was used to examine strong longitudinal measurement invariance.

Consequences of choosing samples in hypothesis testing to ensure homogeneity of variance,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12001,FEB 2014,25,3,"The two-sample Student t test of location was performed on random samples of scores and on rank-transformed scores from normal and non-normal population distributions with unequal variances. The same test also was performed on scores that had been explicitly selected to have nearly equal sample variances. The desired homogeneity of variance was brought about by repeatedly rejecting pairs of samples having a ratio of standard deviations that exceeded a predetermined cut-off value of 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3, while retaining pairs with ratios less than the cut-off value. Despite this forced conformity with the assumption of equal variances, the tests on the selected samples were no more robust than tests on unselected samples, and in most cases substantially less robust. Under conditions where sample sizes were unequal, so that Type I error rates were inflated and power curves were atypical, the selection procedure produced still greater inflation and distortion of the power curves.",,"VIOLATIONS,EQUALITY,DESIGNS","Zimmerman, Donald W.@Carleton Univ, Dept Psychol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Zimmerman, Donald W.@Carleton University",not exist,"The asymptotic behavior of tests for normal means based on a variance pre-test+Albers, W; Boon, PC; Kallenberg, WCM+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 2000::AN EXAMINATION AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF A FORMULA ARISING IN THE PROBLEM OF COMPARING 2 MEAN VALUES+ASPIN, AA+BIOMETRIKA+1948::THE EFFECTS OF VIOLATIONS OF ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE T-TEST+BONEAU, CA+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1960::A Monte Carlo study of type I error rates for the two-sample Behrens-Fisher problem with and without rank transformation+Bradstreet, TE+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUL 31 1997::ANOVA AND MULTIPLE COMPARISONS FOR DATA WITH HETEROGENEOUS VARIANCES+BROWN, MB; FORSYTHE, AB+BIOMETRICS+1974::RANK TRANSFORMATIONS AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN PARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+CONOVER, WJ; IMAN, RL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1981::HOW TO USE THE 2 SAMPLE TERT-TEST+CRESSIE, NAC; WHITFORD, HJ+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1986::no title+Evans, M; Peacock, B; Hastings, N.+Statistical Distributions+2000::Performance of five two-sample location tests for skewed distributions with unequal variances+Fagerland, Morten W.; Sandvik, Leiv+CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS+SEP 2009::The Impact of Levene's Test of Equality of Variances on Statistical Theory and Practice+Gastwirth, Joseph L.; Gel, Yulia R.; Miao, Weiwen+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2009::Contributions to the Theory of 'Student's' t-test as Applied to the Problem of Two Samples+Hsu, P.

Estimation of the predictive power of the model in mixed-effects meta-regression: A simulation study,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12002,FEB 2014,41,24,"Several methods are available to estimate the total and residual amount of heterogeneity in meta-analysis, leading to different alternatives when estimating the predictive power in mixed-effects meta-regression models using the formula proposed by Raudenbush (1994, 2009). In this paper, a simulation study was conducted to compare the performance of seven estimators of these parameters under various realistic scenarios in psychology and related fields. Our results suggest that the number of studies (k) exerts the most important influence on the accuracy of the results, and that precise estimates of the heterogeneity variances and the model predictive power can only be expected with at least 20 and 40 studies, respectively. Increases in the average within-study sample size (N) also improved the results for all estimators. Some differences among the accuracy of the estimators were observed, especially under adverse (small k and N) conditions, while the results for the different methods tended to convergence for more optimal scenarios.",,"RANDOM-EFFECTS METAANALYSIS,HETEROGENEITY VARIANCE,TESTS,MODERATORS,SIZE","Antonio Lopez-Lopez, Jose@Univ Murcia, Dept Basic Psychol & Methodol, E-30100 Murcia, Spain::Marin-Martinez, Fulgencio@Univ Murcia, Dept Basic Psychol & Methodol, E-30100 Murcia, Spain::Sanchez-Meca, Julio@Univ Murcia, Dept Basic Psychol & Methodol, E-30100 Murcia, Spain::Van den Noortgate, Wim@Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium::Viechtbauer, Wolfgang@Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands","Antonio Lopez-Lopez, Jose@University of Murcia::Marin-Martinez, Fulgencio@University of Murcia::Sanchez-Meca, Julio@University of Murcia::Van den Noortgate, Wim@KU Leuven::Viechtbauer, Wolfgang@Maastricht University","Marin Martinez, Fulgencio@G-8836-2011::Viechtbauer, Wolfgang@M-1549-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3463-4063","An alternative to R-2 for assessing linear models of effect size+Aloe, Ariel M.; Becker, Betsy Jane; Pigott, Therese D.+RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS+JUL-DEC 2010::no title+Borenstein, M.; Hedges, L.

The DINA model as a constrained general diagnostic model: Two variants of a model equivalency,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12003,FEB 2014,44,18,"The deterministic-input noisy-AND' (DINA) model is one of the more frequently applied diagnostic classification models for binary observed responses and binary latent variables. The purpose of this paper is to show that the model is equivalent to a special case of a more general compensatory family of diagnostic models. Two equivalencies are presented. Both project the original DINA skill space and design Q-matrix using mappings into a transformed skill space as well as a transformed Q-matrix space. Both variants of the equivalency produce a compensatory model that is mathematically equivalent to the (conjunctive) DINA model. This equivalency holds for all DINA models with any type of Q-matrix, not only for trivial (simple-structure) cases. The two versions of the equivalency presented in this paper are not implied by the recently suggested log-linear cognitive diagnosis model or the generalized DINA approach. The equivalencies presented here exist independent of these recently derived models since they solely require a linear - compensatory - general diagnostic model without any skill interaction terms. Whenever it can be shown that one model can be viewed as a special case of another more general one, conclusions derived from any particular model-based estimates are drawn into question. It is widely known that multidimensional models can often be specified in multiple ways while the model-based probabilities of observed variables stay the same. This paper goes beyond this type of equivalency by showing that a conjunctive diagnostic classification model can be expressed as a constrained special case of a general compensatory diagnostic modelling framework.",,"MULTIDIMENSIONAL IRT MODEL,LARGE-SCALE ASSESSMENT,ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,LATENT CLASS MODELS,VARIABLES","von Davier, Matthias@Educ Testing Serv, Res & Dev, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA","von Davier, Matthias@Educational Testing Service (ETS)",not exist,"Equivalent linear logistic test models+Bechger, TM; Verstralen, HHFM; Verhelst, ND+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2002::no title+Box, G.

Sample size determinations for Welch's test in one-way heteroscedastic ANOVA,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12006,FEB 2014,38,9,"For one-way fixed effects ANOVA, it is well known that the conventional F test of the equality of means is not robust to unequal variances, and numerous methods have been proposed for dealing with heteroscedasticity. On the basis of extensive empirical evidence of Type I error control and power performance, Welch's procedure is frequently recommended as the major alternative to the ANOVA F test under variance heterogeneity. To enhance its practical usefulness, this paper considers an important aspect of Welch's method in determining the sample size necessary to achieve a given power. Simulation studies are conducted to compare two approximate power functions of Welch's test for their accuracy in sample size calculations over a wide variety of model configurations with heteroscedastic structures. The numerical investigations show that Levy's (1978a) approach is clearly more accurate than the formula of Luh and Guo (2011) for the range of model specifications considered here. Accordingly, computer programs are provided to implement the technique recommended by Levy for power calculation and sample size determination within the context of the one-way heteroscedastic ANOVA model.",,"VARIANCE HETEROGENEITY,POPULATION VARIANCES,F-TEST,LOCATION EQUALITY,ALTERNATIVES,STATISTICS,NONNORMALITY,CONSEQUENCES,ROBUST","Jan, Show-Li@Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Chungli, Taiwan::Shieh, Gwowen@Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan","Jan, Show-Li@Chung Yuan Christian University::Shieh, Gwowen@National Chiao Tung University","Shieh, Gwowen@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8611-4495","A NEW AND SIMPLER APPROXIMATION FOR ANOVA UNDER VARIANCE HETEROGENEITY+ALEXANDER, RA; GOVERN, DM+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+SUM 1994::SMALL SAMPLE BEHAVIOR OF SOME STATISTICS WHICH TEST EQUALITY OF SEVERAL MEANS+BROWN, MB; FORSYTHE, AB+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::Parametric alternatives to the analysis of variance+Clinch, J.

Using mixture models with known class membership to address incomplete covariance structures in multiple-group growth models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12008,FEB 2014,47,2,"Multi-group latent growth modelling in the structural equation modelling framework has been widely utilized for examining differences in growth trajectories across multiple manifest groups. Despite its usefulness, the traditional maximum likelihood estimation for multi-group latent growth modelling is not feasible when one of the groups has no response at any given data collection point, or when all participants within a group have the same response at one of the time points. In other words, multi-group latent growth modelling requires a complete covariance structure for each observed group. The primary purpose of the present study is to show how to circumvent these data problems by developing a simple but creative approach using an existing estimation procedure for growth mixture modelling. A Monte Carlo simulation study was carried out to see whether the modified estimation approach provided tangible results and to see how these results were comparable to the standard multi-group results. The proposed approach produced results that were valid and reliable under the mentioned problematic data conditions. We also present a real data example and demonstrate that the proposed estimation approach can be used for the chi-square difference test to check various types of measurement invariance as conducted in a standard multi-group analysis.",,"MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE,CURVE ANALYSIS,FIT INDEXES,LATENT,VARIABLES,PATTERNS","Kim, Su-Young@Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea::Mun, Eun-Young@Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ USA::Smith, Stevens@Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA","Kim, Su-Young@Ewha Womans University::Mun, Eun-Young@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Smith, Stevens@University of Wisconsin Madison@University of Wisconsin System",not exist,"Finite mixtures of covariance structure models with regressors - Loglikelihood function, minimum distance estimation, fit indices, and a complex example+Arminger, G; Stein, P+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+NOV 1997::no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::Latent Curve Models: A Structural Equation Perspective+Bollen, KA; Curran, PJ+LATENT CURVE MODELS: A STRUCTURAL EQUATION PERSPECTIVE+2006::Why Two Smoking Cessation Agents Work Better Than One: Role of Craving Suppression+Bolt, Daniel M.; Piper, Megan E.; Theobald, Wendy E.; et al.+JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 2012::Power calculations for data missing by design: Applications to a follow-up study of lead exposure and attention+Brown, CH; Indurkhya, A; Kellam, SG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2000::TESTING FOR THE EQUIVALENCE OF FACTOR COVARIANCE AND MEAN STRUCTURES - THE ISSUE OF PARTIAL MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE+BYRNE, BM; SHAVELSON, RJ; MUTHEN, B+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+MAY 1989::Evaluating goodness-of-fit indexes for testing measurement invariance+Cheung, GW; Rensvold, RB+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+2002::Empirical and conceptual problems with longitudinal trait-state models: Introducing a trait-state-occasion model+Cole, DA; Martin, NC; Steiger, JH+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 2005::Analysis of longitudinal data within accelerated longitudinal designs+Duncan, SC; Duncan, TE; Hops, H+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 1996::Maximizing the usefulness of data obtained with planned missing value patterns: An application of maximum likelihood procedures+Graham, JW; Hofer, SM; MacKinnon, DP+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1996::SIMULTANEOUS FACTOR ANALYSIS IN SEVERAL POPULATIONS+JORESKOG, KG+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1971::no title+JORESKOG KG+STRUCTURAL EQUATION+1973::no title+Kaplan, D.+Structural equation modeling: Foundations and extensions+2009::Sample Size Requirements in Single- and Multiphase Growth Mixture Models: A Monte Carlo Simulation Study+Kim, Su-Young+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+2012::Disentangling the Prospective Relations Between Maladaptive Cognitions and Depressive Symptoms+LaGrange, Beth; Cole, David A.; Jacquez, Farrah; et al.+JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY+AUG 2011::no title+Little, T.

Compensatory and non-compensatory multidimensional randomized item response models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12012,FEB 2014,37,4,"Randomized response (RR) models are often used for analysing univariate randomized response data and measuring population prevalence of sensitive behaviours. There is much empirical support for the belief that RR methods improve the cooperation of the respondents. Recently, RR models have been extended to measure individual unidimensional behaviour. An extension of this modelling framework is proposed to measure compensatory or non-compensatory multiple sensitive factors underlying the randomized item response process. A confirmatory multidimensional randomized item response theory model (MRIRT) is proposed for the analysis of multivariate RR data by modelling the response process and specifying structural relationships between sensitive behaviours and background information. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to estimate simultaneously the parameters of the MRIRT model. The model extension enables the computation of individual true item response probabilities, estimates of individuals' sensitive behaviour on different domains, and their relationships with background variables. An MRIRT analysis is presented of data from a college alcohol problem scale, measuring alcohol-related socio-emotional and community problems, and alcohol expectancy questionnaire, measuring alcohol-related sexual enhancement expectancies. Students were interviewed via direct or RR questioning. Scores of alcohol-related problems and expectancies are significantly higher for the group of students questioned using the RR technique. Alcohol-related problems and sexual enhancement expectancies are positively moderately correlated and vary differently across gender and universities.",,"CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,ALCOHOL EXPECTANCIES,BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION,PROBLEM DRINKING,POLYTOMOUS DATA,NONCOMPLIANCE,VALIDATION,SCALE","Fox, Jean-Paul@Univ Twente, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands::Entink, Rinke Klein@TNO Zeist, Zeist, Netherlands::Avetisyan, Marianna@Univ Twente, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands","Fox, Jean-Paul@University of Twente::Entink, Rinke Klein@Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research::Avetisyan, Marianna@University of Twente","Fox, Jean-Paul@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0058-1496","MCMC estimation and some model-fit analysis of multidimensional IRT models+Beguin, AA; Glas, CAW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::DO RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE DESIGNS ELIMINATE RESPONSE BIASES?

Bayes factors for testing inequality constrained hypotheses: Issues with prior specification,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12013,FEB 2014,27,10,"Several issues are discussed when testing inequality constrained hypotheses using a Bayesian approach. First, the complexity (or size) of the inequality constrained parameter spaces can be ignored. This is the case when using the posterior probability that the inequality constraints of a hypothesis hold, Bayes factors based on non-informative improper priors, and partial Bayes factors based on posterior priors. Second, the Bayes factor may not be invariant for linear one-to-one transformations of the data. This can be observed when using balanced priors which are centred on the boundary of the constrained parameter space with a diagonal covariance structure. Third, the information paradox can be observed. When testing inequality constrained hypotheses, the information paradox occurs when the Bayes factor of an inequality constrained hypothesis against its complement converges to a constant as the evidence for the first hypothesis accumulates while keeping the sample size fixed. This paradox occurs when using Zellner's g prior as a result of too much prior shrinkage. Therefore, two new methods are proposed that avoid these issues. First, partial Bayes factors are proposed based on transformed minimal training samples. These training samples result in posterior priors that are centred on the boundary of the constrained parameter space with the same covariance structure as in the sample. Second, a g prior approach is proposed by letting g go to infinity. This is possible because the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox is not an issue when testing inequality constrained hypotheses. A simulation study indicated that the Bayes factor based on this g prior approach converges fastest to the true inequality constrained hypothesis.",,MODEL SELECTION,"Mulder, Joris@Tilburg Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","Mulder, Joris@Tilburg University",not exist,"no title+Barlow, RE; Bartholomew, DJ; Bremner, JM<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Brunk, HD</span>.+Statistical Inference under Order Restriction: Theory and Application of Isotonic Regression+1972::A comment on D.

Factorial invariance in multilevel confirmatory factor analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12014,FEB 2014,50,11,"This paper presents a procedure to test factorial invariance in multilevel confirmatory factor analysis. When the group membership is at level 2, multilevel factorial invariance can be tested by a simple extension of the standard procedure. However level-1 group membership raises problems which cannot be appropriately handled by the standard procedure, because the dependency between members of different level-1 groups is not appropriately taken into account. The procedure presented in this article provides a solution to this problem. This paper also shows Muthen's maximum likelihood (MUML) estimation for testing multilevel factorial invariance across level-1 groups as a viable alternative to maximum likelihood estimation. Testing multilevel factorial invariance across level-2 groups and testing multilevel factorial invariance across level-1 groups are illustrated using empirical examples.

Bayesian tests of measurement invariance,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02059.x,NOV 2013,58,16,"Random item effects models provide a natural framework for the exploration of violations of measurement invariance without the need for anchor items. Within the random item effects modelling framework, Bayesian tests (Bayes factor, deviance information criterion) are proposed which enable multiple marginal invariance hypotheses to be tested simultaneously. The performance of the tests is evaluated with a simulation study which shows that the tests have high power and low Type I error rate. Data from the European Social Survey are used to test for measurement invariance of attitude towards immigrant items and to show that background information can be used to explain cross-national variation in item functioning.",,"ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,NATIONAL CONSUMER RESEARCH,HIERARCHICAL IRT MODEL,LIKELIHOOD RATIO,IMMIGRATION,EQUIVALENCE,PARAMETERS,ATTITUDES,CLONING,SCORE","Verhagen, A.

Some recommended statistical analytic practices when reliability generalization studies are conducted,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02057.x,NOV 2013,72,13,"Precursors of the reliability generalization (RG) meta-analytic approach have not established a single preferred analytic method. By means of five real RG examples, we examine how using different statistical methods to integrate coefficients alpha can influence results in RG studies. Specifically, we compare thirteen different statistical models for averaging reliability coefficients and searching for moderator variables that differ in terms of: (a) whether to transform or not the coefficients alpha, and (b) the statistical model assumed, distinguishing between ordinary least squares methods, the fixed-effect (FE) model, the varying coefficient (VC) model, and several versions of the random-effects (RE) model. The results obtained with the different methods exhibited important discrepancies, especially regarding moderator analyses. The main criterion for the model choice should be the extent to which the meta-analyst intends to generalize the results. RE models are the most appropriate when the meta-analyst aims to generalize to a hypothetical population of past or future studies, while FE and VC models are the most appropriate when the interest focuses on generalizing the results to a population of studies identical to those included in the meta-analysis. Finally, some guidelines are proposed for selecting the statistical model when conducting an RG study.",,"RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS,METAANALYTIC INTERVAL ESTIMATION,BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY,EFFECTS META-REGRESSION,ALPHA COEFFICIENTS,SCORE RELIABILITY,MEASUREMENT ERROR,CLINICAL-TRIALS,CARE PROVIDERS,HETEROGENEITY","Sanchez-Meca, Julio@Univ Murcia, E-30100 Murcia, Spain::Antonio Lopez-Lopez, Jose@Univ Murcia, E-30100 Murcia, Spain::Antonio Lopez-Pina, Jose@Univ Murcia, E-30100 Murcia, Spain","Sanchez-Meca, Julio@University of Murcia::Antonio Lopez-Lopez, Jose@University of Murcia::Antonio Lopez-Pina, Jose@University of Murcia",not exist,"A meta-analytic reliability generalization study of the Maslach Burnout Inventory+Aguayo, Raimundo; Vargas, Cristina; de la Fuente, Emilia I.; et al.+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2011::Best-practice recommendations for estimating interaction effects using meta-analysis+Aguinis, Herman; Gottfredson, Ryan K.; Wright, Thomas A.+JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR+NOV 2011::An alternative to R-2 for assessing linear models of effect size+Aloe, Ariel M.; Becker, Betsy Jane; Pigott, Therese D.+RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS+JUL-DEC 2010::Reliability generalization of responses by care providers to the Zarit Burden Interview+Bachner, Y.

Robust tests of equivalence for k independent groups,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02056.x,NOV 2013,14,3,"A common question of interest to researchers in psychology is the equivalence of two or more groups. Failure to reject the null hypothesis of traditional hypothesis tests such as the ANOVA F-test (i.e., H-0: (1)=...= (k)) does not imply the equivalence of the population means. Researchers interested in determining the equivalence of k independent groups should apply a one-way test of equivalence (e.g., Wellek, 2003). The goals of this study were to investigate the robustness of the one-way Wellek test of equivalence to violations of homogeneity of variance assumption, and compare the Type I error rates and power of the Wellek test with a heteroscedastic version which was based on the logic of the one-way Welch (1951) F-test. The results indicate that the proposed Wellek-Welch test was insensitive to violations of the homogeneity of variance assumption, whereas the original Wellek test was not appropriate when the population variances were not equal.",,,"Koh, Andy@York Univ, Dept Psychol, Quantitat Methods Program, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada::Cribbie, Robert@York Univ, Dept Psychol, Quantitat Methods Program, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","Koh, Andy@York University - Canada::Cribbie, Robert@York University - Canada",not exist,"Assessing equivalence: An alternative to the use of difference tests for measuring disparities in vaccination coverage+Barker, LE; Luman, ET; McCauley, MM; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 1 2002::ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::Tests of Equivalence for One-Way Independent Groups Designs+Cribbie, Robert A.; Arpin-Cribbie, Chantal A.; Gruman, Jamie A.+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL EDUCATION+2010::Evaluating clinical significance through equivalence testing: Extending the normative comparisons approach+Cribbie, Robert A.; Arpin-Cribbie, Chantal A.+PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH+2009::The Expanding Role of Quantitative Methodologists in Advancing Psychology+Golinski, Caroline; Cribbie, Robert A.+CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGY-PSYCHOLOGIE CANADIENNE+MAY 2009::Statistical practices of educational researchers: An analysis of their ANOVA, MANOVA, and ANCOVA analyses+Keselman, HJ; Huberty, CJ; Lix, LM; et al.+REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH+FAL 1998::Some empirical power results associated with Welch's robust analysis of variance technique+Levy, K.J.+Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation+1978::EQUIVALENCE OF COMPUTERIZED AND PAPER-AND-PENCIL COGNITIVE-ABILITY TESTS - A METAANALYSIS+MEAD, AD; DRASGOW, F+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+NOV 1993::An investigation of the measurement equivalence of a multifaceted job satisfaction measure+Mueller, K.; Liebig, C.; Hattrup, K.+Educational and Psychological Measurement+2007::no title+no author+R: A language and environment for statistical computing+2010::USING SIGNIFICANCE TESTS TO EVALUATE EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN 2 EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS+ROGERS, JL; HOWARD, KI; VESSEY, JT+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+MAY 1993::Equivalence confidence intervals for two-group comparisons of means+Seaman, MA; Serlin, RC+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 1998::ON THE COMPARISON OF SEVERAL MEAN VALUES - AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH+WELCH, BL+BIOMETRIKA+1951::no title+Wellek, S.+Testing Statistical Hypotheses of Equivalence+2003"

To illustrate, the Woodcock-Johnson III (WJ-III) tests of cognitive abilities were analysed and one between- and two within-person factors were identified. The scoring patterns of individuals in the WJ-III sample were interpreted according to the within-person factor patterns. Regression analyses were performed to examine how much the within-person factors accounted for the person scoring patterns and criterion variables.

Does subgroup membership information lead to better estimation of true subscores?,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02061.x,NOV 2013,13,1,"Haberman (2008) suggested a method to determine if subtest scores have added value over the total score. The method is based on classical test theory and considers the estimation of the true subscores. Performance of subgroups, for example, those based on gender or ethnicity, on subtests is often of interest. Researchers such as Stricker (1993) and Livingston and Rupp (2004) found that the difference in performance between the subgroups often varies over the different subtests. We suggest a method to examine whether the knowledge of the subgroup membership of the examinees leads to a better estimation of the true subscores. We apply our suggested method to data from two operational testing programmes. The knowledge of the subgroup membership of the examinees does not lead to a better estimation of the true subscore for the data sets.",,INVARIANCE,"Haberman, Shelby J.@Educ Testing Serv, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA::Sinharay, Sandip@Educ Testing Serv, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA@CTB McGraw Hill, Monterey, CA 93940 USA","Haberman, Shelby J.@Educational Testing Service (ETS)::Sinharay, Sandip@Educational Testing Service (ETS)",not exist,"Using subpopulation invariance to assess test score equity+Dorans, NJ+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SPR 2004::Population invariance and the equatability of tests: Basic theory and the linear case+Dorans, NJ; Holland, PW+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+WIN 2000::Reporting subscores for institutions+Haberman, Shelby; Sinharay, Sandip; Puhan, Gautam+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 2009::When can subscores have value?+Haberman, Shelby J.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+JUN 2008::Why the major field (business) test does not report subscores of individual test-takers-reliability and construct validity evidence+Ling, G.+ANN M NAT COUNC MEAS+April 2009::Performance of men and women on multiple choice and constructed-response tests for beginning teachers+Livingston, S.

Analysis of multivariate mixed longitudinal data: A flexible latent process approach,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12000,NOV 2013,43,15,"Multivariate ordinal and quantitative longitudinal data measuring the same latent construct are frequently collected in psychology. We propose an approach to describe change over time of the latent process underlying multiple longitudinal outcomes of different types (binary, ordinal, quantitative). By relying on random-effect models, this approach handles individually varying and outcome-specific measurement times. A linear mixed model describes the latent process trajectory while equations of observation combine outcome-specific threshold models for binary or ordinal outcomes and models based on flexible parameterized non-linear families of transformations for Gaussian and non-Gaussian quantitative outcomes. As models assuming continuous distributions may be also used with discrete outcomes, we propose likelihood and information criteria for discrete data to compare the goodness of fit of models assuming either a continuous or a discrete distribution for discrete data. Two analyses of the repeated measures of the Mini-Mental State Examination, a 20-item psychometric test, illustrate the method. First, we highlight the usefulness of parameterized non-linear transformations by comparing different flexible families of transformation for modelling the test as a sum score. Then, change over time of the latent construct underlying directly the 20 items is described using two-parameter longitudinal item response models that are specific cases of the approach.",,"MINI-MENTAL-STATE,COGNITIVE DECLINE,ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE,VARIABLE MODELS,JOINT ANALYSIS,ORDINAL DATA,OUTCOMES,DEMENTIA","Proust-Lima, Cecile@INSERM, ISPED, Ctr INSERM Epidemiol Biostat U897, Bordeaux, France@Univ Bordeaux, ISPED, Ctr INSERM Epidemiol Biostat U897, Bordeaux, France::Amieva, Helene@INSERM, ISPED, Ctr INSERM Epidemiol Biostat U897, Bordeaux, France@Univ Bordeaux, ISPED, Ctr INSERM Epidemiol Biostat U897, Bordeaux, France::Jacqmin-Gadda, Helene@INSERM, ISPED, Ctr INSERM Epidemiol Biostat U897, Bordeaux, France@Univ Bordeaux, ISPED, Ctr INSERM Epidemiol Biostat U897, Bordeaux, France","Proust-Lima, Cecile@Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)@Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine (ComUE)::Amieva, Helene@Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)@Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine (ComUE)::Jacqmin-Gadda, Helene@Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)@Communaute d'Universites et Etablissements d'Aquitaine (ComUE)","Amieva, Helene@E-4850-2014::Proust-Lima, Cecile@E-6670-2014::Jacqmin-gadda, helene@E-5144-2014","no title+Agresti,, A.+Categorical data analysis+1990::The 9 year cognitive decline before dementia of the Alzheimer type: a prospective population-based study+Amieva, H; Jacqmin-Gadda, H; Orgogozo, JM; et al.+BRAIN+MAY 2005::Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease: Successive Emergence of the Clinical Symptoms+Amieva, Helene; Le Goff, Melanie; Millet, Xavier; et al.+ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY+NOV 2008::no title+no author+Item response theory: Parameter estimation techniques+2004::Distributional assumptions of growth mixture models: Implications for overextraction of latent trajectory classes+Bauer, DJ; Curran, PJ+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2003::Comparison of CTT and Rasch-based approaches for the analysis of longitudinal Patient Reported Outcomes+Blanchin, Myriam; Hardouin, Jean-Benoit; Le Neel, Tanguy; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 15 2011::Latent Curve Models: A Structural Equation Perspective+Bollen, KA; Curran, PJ+LATENT CURVE MODELS: A STRUCTURAL EQUATION PERSPECTIVE+2006::Latent variable models for multivariate longitudinal ordinal responses+Cagnone, Silvia; Moustaki, Irini; Vasdekis, Vassilis+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2009::A Two-Tier Full-Information Item Factor Analysis Model with Applications+Cai, Li+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2010::Using statistical procedures to identify differentially functioning test items+Clauser, B.

Testing hypotheses involving Cronbach's alpha using marginal models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12010,NOV 2013,41,5,"We discuss the statistical testing of three relevant hypotheses involving Cronbach's alpha: one where alpha equals a particular criterion; a second testing the equality of two alpha coefficients for independent samples; and a third testing the equality of two alpha coefficients for dependent samples. For each of these hypotheses, various statistical tests have been proposed. Over the years, these tests have depended on progressively fewer assumptions. We propose a new approach to testing the three hypotheses that relies on even fewer assumptions, is especially suited for discrete item scores, and can be applied easily to tests containing large numbers of items. The new approach uses marginal modelling. We compared the Type I error rate and the power of the marginal modelling approach to several of the available tests in a simulation study using realistic conditions. We found that the marginal modelling approach had the most accurate Type I error rates, whereas the power was similar across the statistical tests.",,"COEFFICIENT-ALPHA,CATEGORICAL-DATA,RELIABILITY COEFFICIENT,INTERVAL ESTIMATION,SAMPLE,EQUALITY,APPROXIMATE","Kuijpers, Renske E.@Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands::van der Ark, L.

Revisiting Case IV: A reassessment of bias and standard errors of Case IV under range restriction,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02060.x,NOV 2013,24,5,"In 2004, Hunter and Schmidt proposed a correction (called Case IV) that seeks to estimate disattenuated correlations when selection is made on an unmeasured variable. Although Case IV is an important theoretical development in the range restriction literature, it makes an untestable assumption, namely that the partial correlation between the unobserved selection variable and the performance measure is zero. We show in this paper why this assumption may be difficult to meet and why previous simulations have failed to detect the full extent of bias. We use meta-analytic literature to investigate the plausible range of bias. We also show how Case IV performs in terms of standard errors. Finally, we give practical recommendations about how the contributions of Hunter and Schmidt (2004) can be extended without making such stringent assumptions.",,"PERSONNEL-SELECTION,METAANALYSIS,PERSONALITY,RELIABILITY","Fife, Dustin A.@Univ Oklahoma, Dept Psychol, Norman, OK 73071 USA::Mendoza, Jorge L.@Univ Oklahoma, Dept Psychol, Norman, OK 73071 USA::Terry, Robert@Univ Oklahoma, Dept Psychol, Norman, OK 73071 USA","Fife, Dustin A.@University of Oklahoma System@University of Oklahoma - Norman::Mendoza, Jorge L.@University of Oklahoma System@University of Oklahoma - Norman::Terry, Robert@University of Oklahoma System@University of Oklahoma - Norman",not exist,"EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF RANGE RESTRICTED SDX IN VALIDITY STUDIES+ALEXANDER, RA; ALLIGER, GM; CARSON, KP; et al.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+APR 1989::CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ON MEASUREMENT - A STRUCTURAL EQUATION PERSPECTIVE+BOLLEN, K; LENNOX, R+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+SEP 1991::Three Cs in Measurement Models: Causal Indicators, Composite Indicators, and Covariates+Bollen, Kenneth A.; Bauldry, Shawn+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2011::The relation of candidate personality with selection-interview outcomes+Cook, KW; Vance, CA; Spector, PE+JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+APR 2000::The Assessment of Reliability Under Range Restriction: A Comparison of alpha, omega, and Test-Retest Reliability for Dichotomous Data+Fife, Dustin A.; Mendoza, Jorge L.; Terry, Robert+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+OCT 2012::no title+Hunter, J.

A cluster-based factor rotation,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12007,NOV 2013,19,0,"A new oblique factor rotation method is proposed, the aim of which is to identify a simple and well-clustered structure in a factor loading matrix. A criterion consisting of the complexity of a factor loading matrix and a between-cluster dissimilarity is optimized using the gradient projection algorithm and the k-means algorithm. It is shown that if there is an oblique rotation of an initial loading matrix that has a perfect simple structure, then the proposed method with Kaiser's normalization will produce the perfect simple structure. Although many rotation methods can also recover a perfect simple structure, they perform poorly when a perfect simple structure is not possible. In this case, the new method tends to perform better because it clusters the loadings without requiring the clusters to be perfect. Artificial and real data analyses demonstrate that the proposed method can give a simple structure, which the other methods cannot produce, and provides a more interpretable result than those of widely known rotation techniques.",,"ANALYTIC ROTATION,OBLIQUE ROTATION","Yamamoto, Michio@Osaka Univ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5608531, Japan::Jennrich, Robert I.@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA","Yamamoto, Michio@Osaka University::Jennrich, Robert I.@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"Gradient projection algorithms and software for arbitrary rotation criteria in factor analysis+Bernaards, CA; Jennrich, RI+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+OCT 2005::Orthomax rotation and perfect simple structure+Bernaards, CA; Jennrich, RI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2003::An overview of analytic rotation in exploratory factor analysis+Browne, MW+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+2001::no title+CARROLL JB+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1953::no title+Hastie, T.; Tibshirani, R.; Friedman, J.+The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction+2009::PROMAX - A QUICK METHOD FOR ROTATION TO OBLIQUE SIMPLE STRUCTURE+HENDRICKSON, AE; WHITE, PO+BRITISH JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1964::Rotation to simple loadings using component loss functions: The oblique case+Jennrich, RI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2006::A simple general method for oblique rotation+Jennrich, RI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2002::THE VARIMAX CRITERION FOR ANALYTIC ROTATION IN FACTOR-ANALYSIS+KAISER, HF+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1958::SIMPLIMAX - OBLIQUE ROTATION TO AN OPTIMAL TARGET WITH SIMPLE STRUCTURE+KIERS, HAL+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 1994::LEAST-SQUARES QUANTIZATION IN PCM+LLOYD, SP+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+1982::Sample size in factor analysis: The role of model error+MacCallum, RC; Widaman, KF; Preacher, KJ; et al.+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+2001::no title+no author+R: a Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2005::Local optima in K-means clustering: What you don't know may hurt you+Steinley, D+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2003::K-means clustering: A half-century synthesis+Steinley, Douglas+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2006::no title+Thurstone, L.

The performance of robust test statistics with categorical data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02049.x,MAY 2013,0,24,"This paper reports on a simulation study that evaluated the performance of five structural equation model test statistics appropriate for categorical data. Both Type I error rate and power were investigated. Different model sizes, sample sizes, numbers of categories, and threshold distributions were considered. Statistics associated with both the diagonally weighted least squares (cat-DWLS) estimator and with the unweighted least squares (cat-ULS) estimator were studied. Recent research suggests that cat-ULS parameter estimates and robust standard errors slightly outperform cat-DWLS estimates and robust standard errors (Forero, Maydeu-Olivares, & Gallardo-Pujol, 2009). The findings of the present research suggest that the mean- and variance-adjusted test statistic associated with the cat-ULS estimator performs best overall. A new version of this statistic now exists that does not require a degrees-of-freedom adjustment (Asparouhov & Muthen, 2010), and this statistic is recommended. Overall, the cat-ULS estimator is recommended over cat-DWLS, particularly in small to medium sample sizes.",,,"Savalei, Victoria@Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada::Rhemtulla, Mijke@Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Savalei, Victoria@University of British Columbia::Rhemtulla, Mijke@University of Kansas","Rhemtulla, Mijke@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2572-2424",
The impact of sample non-normality on ANOVA and alternative methods,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02047.x,MAY 2013,22,12,"In this journal, Zimmerman (2004, 2011) has discussed preliminary tests that researchers often use to choose an appropriate method for comparing locations when the assumption of normality is doubtful. The conceptual problem with this approach is that such a two-stage process makes both the power and the significance of the entire procedure uncertain, as type I and type II errors are possible at both stages. A type I error at the first stage, for example, will obviously increase the probability of a type II error at the second stage. Based on the idea of Schmider (2010), which proposes that simulated sets of sample data be ranked with respect to their degree of normality, this paper investigates the relationship between population non-normality and sample non-normality with respect to the performance of the ANOVA, BrownForsythe test, Welch test, and KruskalWallis test when used with different distributions, sample sizes, and effect sizes. The overall conclusion is that the KruskalWallis test is considerably less sensitive to the degree of sample normality when populations are distinctly non-normal and should therefore be the primary tool used to compare locations when it is known that populations are not at least approximately normal.",,"TESTS,ASSUMPTIONS,VARIANCES","Lantz, Bjorn@Univ Boras, S-50190 Boras, Sweden","Lantz, Bjorn@University of Boras",not exist,"A NOTE ON THE GENERATION OF RANDOM NORMAL DEVIATES+BOX, GEP; MULLER, ME+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1958::ANOVA AND MULTIPLE COMPARISONS FOR DATA WITH HETEROGENEOUS VARIANCES+BROWN, MB; FORSYTHE, AB+BIOMETRICS+1974::A POWER PRIMER+COHEN, J+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+JUL 1992::no title+Devroye, L.+Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation+1986::G*Power 3: A flexible statistical power analysis program for the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences+Faul, Franz; Erdfelder, Edgar; Lang, Albert-Georg; et al.+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS+MAY 2007::The ANOVA F-test versus the Kruskal-Wallis test: a robustness study+FEIR, B.; TOOTHAKER, L.+ANN M AM ED RES ASS+1974::CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO MEET ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING FIXED EFFECTS ANALYSES OF VARIANCE AND COVARIANCE+GLASS, GV; PECKHAM, PD; SANDERS, JR+REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH+1972::SUMMARIZING MONTE-CARLO RESULTS IN METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH - THE 1-FACTOR AND 2-FACTOR FIXED EFFECTS ANOVA CASES+HARWELL, MR; RUBINSTEIN, EN; HAYES, WS; et al.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+WIN 1992::Robustness to non-normality of common tests for the many-sample location problem+Khan, A.; Rayner, G.D.+Journal of Applied Mathematics and Decision Sciences+2003::Use of ranks in one-criterion variance analysis+KRUSKAL, WILLIAM H.; WALLIS, W.

Limited-information goodness-of-fit testing of hierarchical item factor models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02050.x,MAY 2013,38,32,"In applications of item response theory, assessment of model fit is a critical issue. Recently, limited-information goodness-of-fit testing has received increased attention in the psychometrics literature. In contrast to full-information test statistics such as Pearson's X2 or the likelihood ratio G2, these limited-information tests utilize lower-order marginal tables rather than the full contingency table. A notable example is Maydeu-Olivares and colleagues'M2 family of statistics based on univariate and bivariate margins. When the contingency table is sparse, tests based on M2 retain better Type I error rate control than the full-information tests and can be more powerful. While in principle the M2 statistic can be extended to test hierarchical multidimensional item factor models (e.g., bifactor and testlet models), the computation is non-trivial. To obtain M2, a researcher often has to obtain (many thousands of) marginal probabilities, derivatives, and weights. Each of these must be approximated with high-dimensional numerical integration. We propose a dimension reduction method that can take advantage of the hierarchical factor structure so that the integrals can be approximated far more efficiently. We also propose a new test statistic that can be substantially better calibrated and more powerful than the original M2 statistic when the test is long and the items are polytomous. We use simulations to demonstrate the performance of our new methods and illustrate their effectiveness with applications to real data.",,"CONTINGENCY-TABLES,BIFACTOR ANALYSIS,CORRELATION-MATRICES,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,UNIFIED FRAMEWORK,RESPONSE THEORY,ALGORITHM,VARIABLES,PROMIS,ERROR","Cai, Li@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA::Hansen, Mark@Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Cai, Li@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System::Hansen, Mark@University of California Los Angeles@University of California System",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS F+1964::no title+no author+PISA 2000 technical report+2002::A goodness of fit test for sparse 2(p) contingency tables+Bartholomew, DJ; Leung, SO+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2002::The goodness of fit of latent trait models in attitude measurement+Bartholomew, DJ; Tzamourani, P+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1999::MARGINAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF ITEM PARAMETERS - APPLICATION OF AN EM ALGORITHM+BOCK, RD; AITKIN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1981::Recovery of weak common factors by maximum likelihood and ordinary least squares estimation+Briggs, NE; MacCallum, RC+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+2003::Alternative ways of assessing model fit+Browne, M.

Thus, before comparing parameter estimates across forms, a linear transformation must be applied to at least one form's scale. The mean-sigma method is a well-known procedure for estimating this adjustment when a common set of items appears on both forms. In this paper, I show both analytically and empirically (through a small simulation study) that the mean-sigma estimators of the transformation constants are biased. While this systematic error was modest relative to random error under the conditions studied here, it is nevertheless intrinsic and its magnitude is conditional on extrinsic design features that include the number of anchor items and the quality of their difficulty estimates.",,"ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,EQUATING COEFFICIENTS,COMMON-ITEM","Baldwin, Peter@Natl Board Med Examiners, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Baldwin, Peter@Unknow",not exist,"An investigation of the sampling distributions of equating coefficients+Baker, FB+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 1996::A COMPARISON OF 2 PROCEDURES FOR COMPUTING IRT EQUATING COEFFICIENTS+BAKER, FB; ALKARNI, A+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SUM 1991::On the mean-sigma estimators and bias+Baldwin, P.+ANN M NAT COUNC MEAS+2011::no title+Haebara, T.+Equating logistic ability scales by a weighted least squares method+1980::no title+Hambleton, R.

We study analytically and through simulation the effects of an omitted variable at level 2 on a 111 mediation model for a randomized experiment conducted within clusters in which the treatment, mediator, and outcome are all measured at level 1. When the residuals in the equations for the mediator and the outcome variables are fully orthogonal, the two methods of calculating the indirect effect (ab, c c) are equivalent at the between- and within-cluster levels. Omitting a variable at level 2 changes the interpretation of the indirect effect and will induce correlations between the random intercepts or random slopes. The equality of within-cluster ab and c c no longer holds. Correlation between random slopes implies that the within-cluster indirect effect is conditional, interpretable at the grand mean level of the omitted variable.",,"HIERARCHICAL LINEAR-MODELS,INFERENCE,SMOKING,SEM","Tofighi, Davood@Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA::West, Stephen G.@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA::MacKinnon, David P.@Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Tofighi, Davood@University System of Georgia@Georgia Institute of Technology::West, Stephen G.@Arizona State University::MacKinnon, David P.@Arizona State University","MacKinnon, David@D-8727-2013::Tofighi, Davood@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8523-7776","no title+Aiken, L.

A unified approach to multiple-set canonical correlation analysis and principal components analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02052.x,MAY 2013,34,8,"Multiple-set canonical correlation analysis and principal components analysis are popular data reduction techniques in various fields, including psychology. Both techniques aim to extract a series of weighted composites or components of observed variables for the purpose of data reduction. However, their objectives of performing data reduction are different. Multiple-set canonical correlation analysis focuses on describing the association among several sets of variables through data reduction, whereas principal components analysis concentrates on explaining the maximum variance of a single set of variables. In this paper, we provide a unified framework that combines these seemingly incompatible techniques. The proposed approach embraces the two techniques as special cases. More importantly, it permits a compromise between the techniques in yielding solutions. For instance, we may obtain components in such a way that they maximize the association among multiple data sets, while also accounting for the variance of each data set. We develop a single optimization function for parameter estimation, which is a weighted sum of two criteria for multiple-set canonical correlation analysis and principal components analysis. We minimize this function analytically. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the performance of the proposed approach based on synthetic data. We also apply the approach for the analysis of functional neuroimaging data to illustrate its empirical usefulness.",,"REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS,FACTORIAL,FUSION","Hwang, Heungsun@McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada::Jung, Kwanghee@Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada::Takane, Yoshio@McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada::Woodward, Todd S.@Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada","Hwang, Heungsun@McGill University::Jung, Kwanghee@University of British Columbia::Takane, Yoshio@McGill University::Woodward, Todd S.@University of British Columbia","Woodward, Todd@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8083-0079","Cluster analysis and marketing research+Arabie, P.; Hubert, L.+Advanced Methods in Marketing Research+1994::Methods and applications of optimal scaling+Bock, R.

Eight methods were compared in terms of actual Type I error and power when the underlying distributions differ in skewness and kurtosis under heterogeneity of variances. For the 21 theoretical distributions, the Yuen test with the bootstrap-t method was the most favourable, followed by test. For the five real data sets, the proposed test and percentile bootstrap method with the one-step M-estimator performed best.",,"POPULATION VARIANCES,TRANSFORMATION","Ozdemir, A.

Model uncertainty and multimodel inference in reliability estimation within a longitudinal framework,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02054.x,MAY 2013,29,0,"Laenen, Alonso, and Molenberghs (2007) and Laenen, Alonso, Molenberghs, and Vangeneugden (2009) proposed a method to assess the reliability of rating scales in a longitudinal context. The methodology is based on hierarchical linear models, and reliability coefficients are derived from the corresponding covariance matrices. However, finding a good parsimonious model to describe complex longitudinal data is a challenging task. Frequently, several models fit the data equally well, raising the problem of model selection uncertainty. When model uncertainty is high one may resort to model averaging, where inferences are based not on one but on an entire set of models. We explored the use of different model building strategies, including model averaging, in reliability estimation. We found that the approach introduced by Laenen et al. (2007, 2009) combined with some of these strategies may yield meaningful results in the presence of high model selection uncertainty and when all models are misspecified, in so far as some of them manage to capture the most salient features of the data. Nonetheless, when all models omit prominent regularities in the data, misleading results may be obtained. The main ideas are further illustrated on a case study in which the reliability of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale is estimated. Importantly, the ambit of model selection uncertainty and model averaging transcends the specific setting studied in the paper and may be of interest in other areas of psychometrics.",,"SELECTION,LIKELIHOOD","Alonso, Ariel@Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands::Laenen, Annouschka@Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Alonso, Ariel@Maastricht University::Laenen, Annouschka@KU Leuven",not exist,"THE LITTLE BOOTSTRAP AND OTHER METHODS FOR DIMENSIONALITY SELECTION IN REGRESSION - X-FIXED PREDICTION ERROR+BREIMAN, L+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1992::no title+Brennan, RL.+Generalizability Theory+2001::EMPIRICAL-MODELS FOR THE SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION OF WILDLIFE+BUCKLAND, ST; ELSTON, DA+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY+1993::no title+Burnham, K.

Measuring change for a multidimensional test using a generalized explanatory longitudinal item response model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02058.x,MAY 2013,56,6,"Even though many educational and psychological tests are known to be multidimensional, little research has been done to address how to measure individual differences in change within an item response theory framework. In this paper, we suggest a generalized explanatory longitudinal item response model to measure individual differences in change. New longitudinal models for multidimensional tests and existing models for unidimensional tests are presented within this framework and implemented with software developed for generalized linear models. In addition to the measurement of change, the longitudinal models we present can also be used to explain individual differences in change scores for person groups (e.g., learning disabled students versus non-learning disabled students) and to model differences in item difficulties across item groups (e.g., number operation, measurement, and representation item groups in a mathematics test). An empirical example illustrates the use of the various models for measuring individual differences in change when there are person groups and multiple skill domains which lead to multidimensionality at a time point.",,"HIERARCHICAL MEASUREMENT MODEL,LATENT GROWTH-MODELS,LINEAR MIXED MODELS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,MULTILEVEL MODELS,BINARY RESPONSES,MULTIVARIATE,INFORMATION","Cho, Sun-Joo@Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA::Athay, Michele@Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA::Preacher, Kristopher J.@Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA","Cho, Sun-Joo@Vanderbilt University Peabody College@Vanderbilt University::Athay, Michele@Vanderbilt University Peabody College@Vanderbilt University::Preacher, Kristopher J.@Vanderbilt University Peabody College@Vanderbilt University",not exist,"A new look at the statistical models identification+Akaike, H.+IEEE Trans Autom Control, AC+1974::ESTIMATING LATENT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN REPEATED TESTINGS+ANDERSEN, EB+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1985::COMPARING LATENT DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDERSEN, EB+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1980::General random effect latent variable modeling: Random subjects, items, contexts, and parameters+Asparouhov, T.; Muthen, B.+ANN M NAT COUNC MEAS+2012::no title+Bates,, D.; Maechler,, M.; Dai,, B.+lme4: linear mixed-effects models using S4 classes . 2009.

We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.",,"COMPOSITE NULL MODELS,GOODNESS-OF-FIT,P-VALUES,MULTIPARTY ELECTORATES,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION,PROBABILISTIC MODEL,HIERARCHICAL-MODELS,SOCIAL-RESEARCH,PARTY SUPPORT,2ND LEVELS","Gelman, Andrew@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA@Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA::Shalizi, Cosma Rohilla@Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Stat, Santa Fe Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Gelman, Andrew@Columbia University::Shalizi, Cosma Rohilla@The Santa Fe Institute@Carnegie Mellon University",not exist,"no title+Abbott, A.+Chaos of Disciplines+2001::no title+al Ghazali, Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad at-Tusi.+The incoherence of the philosophers = Tahafut al-falasifah: A parallel English-Arabic text+1997::no title+Ashby, W.+Design for a Brain.

"Posterior predictive checks can and should be Bayesian: Comment on Gelman and Shalizi, Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics'",BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02063.x,FEB 2013,32,14,"Bayesian inference is conditional on the space of models assumed by the analyst. The posterior distribution indicates only which of the available parameter values are less bad than the others, without indicating whether the best available parameter values really fit the data well. A posterior predictive check is important to assess whether the posterior predictions of the least bad parameters are discrepant from the actual data in systematic ways. Gelman and Shalizi (2012a) assert that the posterior predictive check, whether done qualitatively or quantitatively, is non-Bayesian. I suggest that the qualitative posterior predictive check might be Bayesian, and the quantitative posterior predictive check should be Bayesian. In particular, I show that the Bayesian p-value, from which an analyst attempts to reject a model without recourse to an alternative model, is ambiguous and inconclusive. Instead, the posterior predictive check, whether qualitative or quantitative, should be consummated with Bayesian estimation of an expanded model. The conclusion agrees with Gelman and Shalizi regarding the importance of the posterior predictive check for breaking out of an initially assumed space of models. Philosophically, the conclusion allows the liberation to be completely Bayesian instead of relying on a non-Bayesian deus ex machina. Practically, the conclusion cautions against use of the Bayesian p-value in favour of direct model expansion and Bayesian evaluation.",,"PROBABILISTIC MODELS,PRIOR SENSITIVITY,INDUCTIVE BIASES,T-DISTRIBUTION,INFERENCE,PERCEPTION,COGNITION","Kruschke, John K.@Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Kruschke, John K.@Indiana University Bloomington@Indiana University System",not exist,"Probabilistic models of cognition: Conceptual foundations+Chater, Nick; Tenenbaum, Joshua B.; Yuille, Alan+TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES+JUL 2006::no title+Cox, D.

They present an alternative hypothetico-deductive approach to remedy both shortcomings. We agree with Gelman and Shalizi's criticism of the usual story, but disagree on whether Bayesian confirmation theory should be abandoned. We advocate a humble Bayesian approach, in which Bayesian confirmation theory is the central inferential method. A humble Bayesian checks her models and critically assesses whether the Bayesian statistical inferences can reasonably be called upon to support real-world inferences.",,STATISTICAL-MODEL,"Morey, Richard D.@Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands::Romeijn, Jan-Willem@Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands::Rouder, Jeffrey N.@Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands","Morey, Richard D.@University of Groningen::Romeijn, Jan-Willem@University of Groningen::Rouder, Jeffrey N.@University of Groningen","Morey, Richard@B-1945-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9220-3179::Rouder, Jeffrey@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2023-3891","When Scientific Models Represent+Bailor-Jones, D.+International Studies in the Philosophy of Science+2003::The Case for Objective Bayesian Analysis+Berger, James+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::Robustness in the strategy of scientific model building+Box, G.E.P.+Robustness in Statistics+1979::The well-calibrated Bayesian+Dawid, Philip A.+Journal of the American Statistical Association+1982::La logique de la probabilite+de Finetti, B.+English version: The logic of probability+1936::HOW TO TELL WHEN SIMPLER, MORE UNIFIED, OR LESS AD-HOC THEORIES WILL PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS+FORSTER, M; SOBER, E+BRITISH JOURNAL FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE+MAR 1994::Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics+Gelman, Andrew; Shalizi, Cosma Rohilla+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 2013::Subjective Bayesian Analysis: Principles and Practice+Goldstein, Michael+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::no title+HOWSON C+APPL LOG SER+2001::Models and representation+Hughes, RIG+PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE+DEC 1997::The role of models in physics+Hutten, E.+British Journal for the Philosophy of Science+1954::Statistical model selection criteria and Bayesianism+Kieseppa, IA+PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE+SEP 2001::no title+Mayo, D.+Error and the Growth of Scientific Knowledge+1996::Error statistics+Mayo, D.; Spanos, A.+HDB PHILOS SCI+2011::A statistical model for discriminating between subliminal and near-liminal performance+Morey, Richard D.; Rouder, Jeffrey N.; Speckman, Paul L.+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 2008::Bayes Factor Approaches for Testing Interval Null Hypotheses+Morey, Richard D.; Rouder, Jeffrey N.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2011::A Truncated-Probit Item Response Model for Estimating Psychophysical Thresholds+Morey, Richard D.; Rouder, Jeffrey N.; Speckman, Paul L.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2009::A philosopher's view on Bayesian evaluation of informative hypotheses+Romeijn, J.

A clusterwise simultaneous component method for capturing within-cluster differences in component variances and correlations,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02040.x,FEB 2013,34,16,"This paper presents a clusterwise simultaneous component analysis for tracing structural differences and similarities between data of different groups of subjects. This model partitions the groups into a number of clusters according to the covariance structure of the data of each group and performs a simultaneous component analysis with invariant pattern restrictions (SCA-P) for each cluster. These restrictions imply that the model allows for between-group differences in the variances and the correlations of the cluster-specific components. As such, clusterwise SCA-P is more flexible than the earlier proposed clusterwise SCA-ECP model, which imposed equal average cross-products constraints on the component scores of the groups that belong to the same cluster. Using clusterwise SCA-P, a finer-grained, yet parsimonious picture of the group differences and similarities can be obtained. An algorithm for fitting clusterwise SCA-P solutions is presented and its performance is evaluated by means of a simulation study. The value of the model for empirical research is illustrated with data from psychiatric diagnosis research.",,"PERSONALITY,ROTATION","De Roover, Kim@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Educ Sci, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Ceulemans, Eva@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Educ Sci, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Timmerman, Marieke E.@Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands::Onghena, Patrick@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Educ Sci, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","De Roover, Kim@KU Leuven::Ceulemans, Eva@KU Leuven::Timmerman, Marieke E.@University of Groningen::Onghena, Patrick@KU Leuven","Onghena, Patrick@M-6649-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3986-8312::Ceulemans, Eva@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7611-4683","On the interface between cluster analysis, principal component analysis, andmultidimensional scaling+Bock, H.

Continuous time modelling with individually varying time intervals for oscillating and non-oscillating processes,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02043.x,FEB 2013,50,22,"When designing longitudinal studies, researchers often aim at equal intervals. In practice, however, this goal is hardly ever met, with different time intervals between assessment waves and different time intervals between individuals being more the rule than the exception. One of the reasons for the introduction of continuous time models by means of structural equation modelling has been to deal with irregularly spaced assessment waves (e.g., Oud & Delsing, 2010). In the present paper we extend the approach to individually varying time intervals for oscillating and non-oscillating processes. In addition, we show not only that equal intervals are unnecessary but also that it can be advantageous to use unequal sampling intervals, in particular when the sampling rate is low. Two examples are provided to support our arguments. In the first example we compare a continuous time model of a bivariate coupled process with varying time intervals to a standard discrete time model to illustrate the importance of accounting for the exact time intervals. In the second example the effect of different sampling intervals on estimating a damped linear oscillator is investigated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. We conclude that it is important to account for individually varying time intervals, and encourage researchers to conceive of longitudinal studies with different time intervals within and between individuals as an opportunity rather than a problem.",,"PANEL-DATA,UNIFIED SEM,SYSTEMS,POWER","Voelkle, Manuel C.@Max Planck Inst Human Dev, D-14195 Berlin, Germany::Oud, Johan H.

The simulation involved 144 conditions (1,000 replications per condition) that were defined by a combination of (a) two types of latent factor models, (b) four sample sizes (100, 250, 500, 1,000), (c) three factor loadings (low, moderate, strong), (d) three levels of non-normality (normal, moderately, and extremely non-normal), and (e) whether the factor model was correctly specified or misspecified. The results showed that when the model was correctly specified, PIV produced estimates that were as accurate as ULS and DWLS. Furthermore, the simulation showed that PIV was more robust to structural misspecifications than ULS and DWLS.",,"STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,ASYMPTOTIC COVARIANCE-MATRIX,INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES,POLYCHORIC CORRELATIONS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,DISTRIBUTIONS,INDICATORS","Nestler, Steffen@Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, D-55122 Mainz, Germany","Nestler, Steffen@Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz",not exist,"Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables+Angrist, JD; Imbens, GW; Rubin, DB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1996::The sensitivity of confirmatory maximum likelihood factor analysis to violations of measurement scale and distributional assumptions+Babakus, E.; Ferguson, C.

The linear transformation model with frailties for the analysis of item response times,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02045.x,FEB 2013,50,16,"The item response times (RTs) collected from computerized testing represent an underutilized source of information about items and examinees. In addition to knowing the examinees responses to each item, we can investigate the amount of time examinees spend on each item. In this paper, we propose a semi-parametric model for RTs, the linear transformation model with a latent speed covariate, which combines the flexibility of non-parametric modelling and the brevity as well as interpretability of parametric modelling. In this new model, the RTs, after some non-parametric monotone transformation, become a linear model with latent speed as covariate plus an error term. The distribution of the error term implicitly defines the relationship between the RT and examinees latent speeds; whereas the non-parametric transformation is able to describe various shapes of RT distributions. The linear transformation model represents a rich family of models that includes the Cox proportional hazards model, the BoxCox normal model, and many other models as special cases. This new model is embedded in a hierarchical framework so that both RTs and responses are modelled simultaneously. A two-stage estimation method is proposed. In the first stage, the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is employed to estimate the parametric part of the model. In the second stage, an estimating equation method with a recursive algorithm is adopted to estimate the non-parametric transformation. Applicability of the new model is demonstrated with a simulation study and a real data application. Finally, methods to evaluate the model fit are suggested.",,"CENSORED-DATA,LIKELIHOOD METHODS,REGRESSION,SPEED,TESTS,TRAIT,SPEEDEDNESS,DIFFICULTY,FRAMEWORK,INFERENCE","Wang, Chun@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA::Chang, Hua-Hua@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA::Douglas, Jeffrey A.@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Wang, Chun@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign::Chang, Hua-Hua@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign::Douglas, Jeffrey A.@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign",not exist,"SOME LOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE FIDUCIAL ARGUMENT+BARNARD, GA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1963::Analysis of survival data by the proportional odds model.+Bennett, S+Statistics in medicine+1983 Apr-Jun::no title+Bickel, P.

Evaluation of dominance-based ordinal multiple regression for variables with few categories,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2012.02046.x,FEB 2013,34,0,"Dominance-based ordinal multiple regression (DOR) is designed to answer ordinal questions about relationships among ordinal variables. Only one parameter per predictor is estimated, and the number of parameters is constant for any number of outcome levels. The majority of existing simulation evaluations of DOR use predictors that are continuous or ordinal with many categories, so the performance of the method is not well understood for ordinal variables with few categories. This research evaluates DOR in simulations using three-category ordinal variables for the outcome and predictors, with a comparison to the cumulative logits proportional odds model (POC). Although ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is inapplicable for theoretical reasons, it was also included in the simulations because of its popularity in the social sciences. Most simulation outcomes indicated that DOR performs well for variables with few categories, and is preferable to the POC for smaller samples and when the proportional odds assumption is violated. Nevertheless, confidence interval coverage for DOR was not flawless and possibilities for improvement are suggested.",,"GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,GAMMA-FAMILY MEASURES,INDEPENDENT VARIABLES,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,RANK CORRELATION,ASSOCIATION,SENSITIVITY,PREDICTORS,VARIANCES","Woods, Carol M.@Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Woods, Carol M.@University of Kansas",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Analysis of Ordinal Categorical Data+2010::Confidence intervals for multinomial logistic regression in sparse data+Bull, S.; Lewinger, J.; Lee, S.+Statistics in Medicine+2006::A modified score function estimator for multinomial logistic regression in small samples+Bull, SB; Mak, C; Greenwood, CMT+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 28 2002::PREDICTING ORDINAL RELATIONS+CLIFF, N+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1994::VARIANCES AND COVARIANCES OF KENDALL TAU AND THEIR ESTIMATION+CLIFF, N; CHARLIN, V+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1991::no title+Cliff, N.+Ordinal Methods for Behavioral Data Analysis+1996::BIAS REDUCTION OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATES+FIRTH, D+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1993::Penalized Regression with Ordinal Predictors+Gertheiss, Jan; Tutz, Gerhard+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 2009::Selection of ordinally scaled independent variables with applications to international classification of functioning core sets+Gertheiss, Jan; Hogger, Sara; Oberhauser, Cornelia; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2011::INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES IN SENSITIVITY TO DISGUST - A SCALE SAMPLING 7 DOMAINS OF DISGUST ELICITORS+HAIDT, J; MCCAULEY, C; ROZIN, P+PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES+MAY 1994::MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF ORDINAL MEASURES+HAWKES, RK+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY+1971::A new measure of rank correlation+Kendall, MG+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1938::THE SNAQ(RC), AN EASY TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEM AS A FIRST STEP IN THE RECOGNITION OF UNDERNUTRITION IN RESIDENTIAL CARE+Kruizenga, H.

Sample size planning for composite reliability coefficients: Accuracy in parameter estimation via narrow confidence intervals,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02030.x,NOV 2012,69,4,"Composite measures play an important role in psychology and related disciplines. Composite measures almost always have error. Correspondingly, it is important to understand the reliability of the scores from any particular composite measure. However, the point estimates of the reliability of composite measures are fallible and thus all such point estimates should be accompanied by a confidence interval. When confidence intervals are wide, there is much uncertainty in the population value of the reliability coefficient. Given the importance of reporting confidence intervals for estimates of reliability, coupled with the undesirability of wide confidence intervals, we develop methods that allow researchers to plan sample size in order to obtain narrow confidence intervals for population reliability coefficients. We first discuss composite reliability coefficients and then provide a discussion on confidence interval formation for the corresponding population value. Using the accuracy in parameter estimation approach, we develop two methods to obtain accurate estimates of reliability by planning sample size. The first method provides a way to plan sample size so that the expected confidence interval width for the population reliability coefficient is sufficiently narrow. The second method ensures that the confidence interval width will be sufficiently narrow with some desired degree of assurance (e.g., 99% assurance that the 95% confidence interval for the population reliability coefficient will be less than W units wide). The effectiveness of our methods was verified with Monte Carlo simulation studies. We demonstrate how to easily implement the methods with easy-to-use and freely available software.",,"ESSENTIAL TAU-EQUIVALENCE,SCORE RELIABILITY,INTERNAL CONSISTENCY,SCALE RELIABILITY,STANDARD ERROR,ALPHA,GENERALIZABILITY,REQUIREMENTS,METAANALYSIS,VIOLATIONS","Terry, Leann@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Kelley, Ken@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Management, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Terry, Leann@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Kelley, Ken@University of Notre Dame","Kelley, Ken@C-7322-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4756-8360","AERA standards for reporting on empirical social science research in AERA publications+no author+Educational Researcher+2006::no title+*APA+PUBL MAN AM PSYCH AS+2001::no title+no author+Publication manual of the American Psychological Association+2009::no title+Bollen, KA.+&lt;IT&gt;Structural Equations with Latent Variables&lt;/IT&gt;+1989::Sample size requirements for testing and estimating coefficient alpha+Bonett, DG+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+WIN 2002::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.L.+Statistical Inference+2002::Sample size requirements for precise estimates of reliability, generalizability, and validity coefficients+Charter, RA+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY+AUG 1999::THE EARTH IS ROUND (P-LESS-THAN.05)+COHEN, J+AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST+DEC 1994::no title+Cohen, J.+Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences+1988::WHAT IS COEFFICIENT ALPHA - AN EXAMINATION OF THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+CORTINA, JM+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 1993::no title+CRONBACH LJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1951::Alpha's standard error (ASE): An accurate and precise confidence interval estimate+Duhachek, A; Iacobucci, D+JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY+OCT 2004::no title+Eden, Jill.+Knowing What Works in Health Care: A Roadmap for the Nation+2008::Confidence intervals about score reliability coefficients, please: An EPM guidelines editorial+Fan, XT; Thompson, B+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+AUG 2001::Congeneric and (essentially) tau-equivalent estimates of score reliability - What they are and how to use them+Graham, James M.+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 2006::Commentary on Coefficient Alpha: A Cautionary Tale+Green, Samuel B.; Yang, Yanyun+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2009::Correlated Errors in True Score Models and Their Effect on Coefficient Alpha+Green, Samuel B.; Hershberger, Scott L.+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+2000::no title+GUTTMAN L+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1945::no title+Hahn, G.

Implications of statistical power for confidence intervals,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02035.x,NOV 2012,12,5,"The statistical power of a hypothesis test is closely related to the precision of the accompanying confidence interval. In the case of a z-test, the width of the confidence interval is a function of statistical power for the planned study. If minimum effect size is used in power analysis, the width of the confidence interval is the minimum effect size times a multiplicative factor f. The index f, or the precision-to-effect ratio, is a function of the computed statistical power. In the case of a t-test, statistical power affects the probability of achieving a certain width of confidence interval, which is equivalent to the probability of obtaining a certain value of f. To consider estimate precision in conjunction with statistical power, we can choose a sample size to obtain a desired probability of achieving a short width conditional on the rejection of the null hypothesis.",,SAMPLE-SIZE DETERMINATION,"Liu, Xiaofeng Steven@Univ S Carolina, Dept Educ Studies, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Liu, Xiaofeng Steven@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina System",not exist,"Standardized or simple effect size: What should be reported?+Baguley, Thom+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY+AUG 2009::SAMPLE-SIZE DETERMINATION FOR CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS ON THE POPULATION MEAN AND ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 2 POPULATION MEANS+BEAL, SL+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1989::no title+Cochran, W.

Parameter estimation of multiple item response profile model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02036.x,NOV 2012,75,7,"Multiple item response profile (MIRP) models are models with crossed fixed and random effects. At least one between-person factor is crossed with at least one within-person factor, and the persons nested within the levels of the between-person factor are crossed with the items within levels of the within-person factor. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of models for binary data with crossed random effects is challenging. This is because the marginal likelihood does not have a closed form, so that MLE requires numerical or Monte Carlo integration. In addition, the multidimensional structure of MIRPs makes the estimation complex. In this paper, three different estimation methods to meet these challenges are described: the Laplace approximation to the integrand; hierarchical Bayesian analysis, a simulation-based method; and an alternating imputation posterior with adaptive quadrature as the approximation to the integral. In addition, this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these three estimation methods for MIRPs. The three algorithms are compared in a real data application and a simulation study was also done to compare their behaviour.",,"LINEAR MIXED MODELS,FIXED-EFFECT FALLACY,MULTILEVEL MODELS,LAPLACE APPROXIMATION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,DATA AUGMENTATION,BINARY RESPONSES,BIAS CORRECTION,IRT MODEL,LANGUAGE","Cho, Sun-Joo@Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Nashville, TN 37203 USA::Partchev, Ivailo@Cito, Arnhem, Netherlands::De Boeck, Paul@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium","Cho, Sun-Joo@Vanderbilt University Peabody College@Vanderbilt University::Partchev, Ivailo@Unknow::De Boeck, Paul@University of Amsterdam@KU Leuven","De Boeck, Paul@L-3508-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0884-2582","A new look at the statistical models identification+Akaike, H.+IEEE Trans Autom Control, AC+1974::Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items+Baayen, R.

Cointegration methodology for psychological researchers: An introduction to the analysis of dynamic process systems,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02033.x,NOV 2012,48,4,"Longitudinal data analysis focused on internal characteristics of a single time series has attracted increasing interest among psychologists. The systemic psychological perspective suggests, however, that many long-term phenomena are mutually interconnected, forming a dynamic system. Hence, only multivariate methods can handle such human dynamics appropriately. Unlike the majority of time series methodologies, the cointegration approach allows interdependencies of integrated (i.e., extremely unstable) processes to be modelled. This advantage results from the fact that cointegrated series are connected by stationary long-run equilibrium relationships. Vector error-correction models are frequently used representations of cointegrated systems. They capture both this equilibrium and compensation mechanisms in the case of short-term deviations due to developmental changes. Thus, the past disequilibrium serves as explanatory variable in the dynamic behaviour of current variables. Employing empirical data from cognitive psychology, psychosomatics, and marital interaction research, this paper describes how to apply cointegration methods to dynamic process systems and how to interpret the parameters under investigation from a psychological perspective.",,"TIME-SERIES,ERROR-CORRECTION,CRIME,PSYCHOTHERAPY,ILLUSTRATION,PERSONALITY,NOISE,DRUNK,MODEL,DOG","Stroe-Kunold, Esther@Univ Heidelberg, Dept Gen Internal Med & Psychosomat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany::Gruber, Antje@Univ Heidelberg, Dept Psychol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany::Stadnytska, Tetiana@Univ Ulm, Dept Psychol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany::Werner, Joachim@Univ Heidelberg, Dept Psychol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany::Brosig, Burkhard@Univ Clin Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Giessen, Germany","Stroe-Kunold, Esther@Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg::Gruber, Antje@Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg::Stadnytska, Tetiana@Ulm University::Werner, Joachim@Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg::Brosig, Burkhard@Unknow","Brosig, Burkhard@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3794-9976","COINTEGRATION, FRACTIONAL COINTEGRATION, AND EXCHANGE-RATE DYNAMICS+BAILLIE, RT; BOLLERSLEV, T+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+JUN 1994::The Methodology of Cointegration+Beck, Nathaniel.+Political Analysis+1992::Divorce and female labor force participation: Evidence from time- series data and cointegration+Bremmer, D.; Kesselring, R.+Atlantic Economic Journal+2004::no title+C ongdon, P.+Applied bayesian modelling+2003::no title+Carver, C.

The impact of ignoring multiple membership data structures in multilevel models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02023.x,MAY 2012,34,18,"This study compared the use of the conventional multilevel model (MM) with that of the multiple membership multilevel model (MMMM) for handling multiple membership data structures. Multiple membership data structures are commonly encountered in longitudinal educational data sets in which, for example, mobile students are members of more than one higher-level unit (e.g., school). While the conventional MM requires the user either to delete mobile students data or to ignore prior schools attended, MMMM permits inclusion of mobile students data and models the effect of all schools attended on student outcomes. The simulation study identified underestimation of the school-level predictor coefficient, as well as underestimation of the level-two variance component with corresponding overestimation of the level-one variance when multiple membership data structures were ignored. Results are discussed along with limitations and ideas for future MMMM methodological research as well as implications for applied researchers.",,"CROSS-CLASSIFIED DATA,EDUCATIONAL-ACHIEVEMENT,SCHOOL DIFFERENCES,COMPLEXITY,MOBILITY","Chung, Hyewon@CUNY John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10019 USA::Beretvas, S.

Stable unstable reliability theory,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2010.02011.x,MAY 2012,43,0,"Classical reliability theory assumes that individuals have identical true scores on both testing occasions, a condition described as stable. If some individuals true scores are different on different testing occasions, described as unstable, the estimated reliability can be misleading. A model called stable unstable reliability theory (SURT) frames stability or instability as an empirically testable question. SURT assumes a mixed population of stable and unstable individuals in unknown proportions, with wi the probability that individual i is stable. wi becomes is test score weight which is used to form a weighted correlation coefficient rw which is reliability under SURT. If all wi= 1 then rw is the classical reliability coefficient; thus classical theory is a special case of SURT. Typically rw is larger than the conventional reliability r, and confidence intervals on true scores are typically shorter than conventional intervals. rw is computed with routines in a publicly available R package.",,"TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY,MEASUREMENT ERROR,PARAMETERS,VALIDITY,MODELS","Thomas, Hoben@Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA::Lohaus, Arnold@Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany::Domsch, Holger@Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany","Thomas, Hoben@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)@Penn State University::Lohaus, Arnold@University of Bielefeld::Domsch, Holger@University of Bielefeld",not exist,"no title+Arbuckle, JL.+Amos 17 users' guide+2008::no title+ARMINGER G+MECOSA 3 USER GUIDE+1996::INTERRATER AND TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY OF 2 PEDIATRIC BALANCE TESTS+ATWATER, SW; CROWE, TK; DEITZ, JC; et al.+PHYSICAL THERAPY+FEB 1990::Test-retest reliability and validity of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in primary insomnia+Backhaus, J; Junghanns, K; Broocks, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH+SEP 2002::Old and new approaches to latent variable modelling+Bartholomew, DJ+LATENT VARIABLE AND LATENT STRUCTURE MODELS+2002::mixtools: An R Package for Analyzing Finite Mixture Models+Benaglia, Tatiana; Chauveau, Didier; Hunter, David R.; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+OCT 2009::Test-Retest Reliability of Saccadic Measures in Subjects at Risk for Huntington Disease+Blekher, Tanya; Weaver, Marjorie R.; Cai, Xueya; et al.+INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY &amp; VISUAL SCIENCE+DEC 2009::SOME EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS IN THE CORRELATION OF MENTAL ABILITIES+Brown, William+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY+OCT 1910::no title+CRONBACH LJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1951::no title+Efron, B.; Tibshirani, R.

Circular data are data measured in the form of angles or two-dimensional orientations. As an example, experiments investigating the development of spatial memory and the influence of visual experience on haptic orientation perception are presented. Three permutation tests are proposed for the evaluation of ordered hypotheses. The quality of the permutation tests is investigated by means of several simulation studies. The results of these studies show the expected increase in power when the permutation tests for ordered hypotheses are compared to a common non-directional test for circular data.

A latent class model is proposed for ordinal items with inequality constraints on the class-specific item means. This model is used as a tool for testing for violations of M and IIO. A Gibbs sampling scheme is used for estimating the model parameters.

The design of the Monte Carlo simulation study included four test lengths (10, 15, 25, 40), three sample sizes (500, 1000, 2500), two simulated mixture conditions (one and two groups), and population homogeneity (equally sized subgroups) or heterogeneity (one subgroup three times larger than the other). The results show that both increasing sample size and increasing number of items lead to higher accuracy; medium-range parameters were estimated more precisely than extreme ones; and the accuracy was higher in homogeneous populations. The minimum-BIC method leads to almost perfect results and is more reliable than AIC-based model selection. The results are compared to findings by Li, Cohen, Kim, and Cho (2009) and practical guidelines are provided.",,"ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,LATENT CLASS,MONTE-CARLO,FAKING","Preinerstorfer, David@Univ Vienna, Dept Stat & Operat Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria::Formann, Anton K.@Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Dept Basic Psychol Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","Preinerstorfer, David@University of Vienna::Formann, Anton K.@University of Vienna",not exist,"Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike,, H.+P 2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF CONDITIONAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATORS+ANDERSEN, EB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1970::Modern psychometrics for the experimental psychology of reasoning+Bonnefon, J.; Vautier, S.+&lt;IT&gt;Acta Psychologica Sinica&lt;/IT&gt;+2010::A mixed Rasch model of dual-process conditional reasoning+Bonnefon, Jean-Francois; Eid, Michael; Vautier, Stephane; et al.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2008::MODEL SELECTION AND AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) - THE GENERAL-THEORY AND ITS ANALYTICAL EXTENSIONS+BOZDOGAN, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::The precision of simulation study results+Cohen, AS; Kane, MT; Kim, SH+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUN 2001::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Detecting Response Styles and Faking in Personality and Organizational Assessments by Mixed Rasch Models+Eid, Michael; Zickar, Michael J.+MULTIVARIATE AND MIXTURE DISTRIBUTION RASCH MODELS: EXTENSIONS AND APPLICATIONS+2007::no title+Fischer, GH.+Einfuhrung in die Theorie Psychologischer Tests+1974::Structural latent class models+Formann, AK; Kohlmann, T+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1998::(Almost) Equivalence Between Conditional and Mixture Maximum Likelihood Estimates for Some Models of the Rasch Type+Formann, Anton K.+MULTIVARIATE AND MIXTURE DISTRIBUTION RASCH MODELS: EXTENSIONS AND APPLICATIONS+2007::Training-related changes in solution strategy in a spatial test: An application of item response models+Gluck, J; Machat, R; Jirasko, M; et al.+LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES+2001::Monte Carlo studies in item response theory+Harwell, M; Stone, CA; Hsu, TC; et al.+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUN 1996::Analyzing the results of Monte Carlo studies in item response theory+Harwell, MR+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+APR 1997::Extended Rasch modeling: the eRm package for the application of IRT models in R+Hatzinger, R.; Mair, P.+Journal of Statistical Software+2007::Mixed Rasch modeling of the self-rating depression scale - Incorporating latent class and Rasch rating scale models+Hong, Sehee; Min, Sae-Young+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+APR 2007::AIC and BIC - Comparisons of assumptions and performance+Kuha, J+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+NOV 2004::Chapter The American Soldier: Studies in Social Psychology in World War II+LAZARSFELD, P.F.+The logical and mathematical foundations of latent structure analysis+1950::no title+Lazarsfeld, PF; Henry, NW.+Latent Structure Analysis+1968::Model Selection Methods for Mixture Dichotomous IRT Models+Li, Feiming; Cohen, Allan S.; Kim, Seock-Ho; et al.+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUL 2009::The personal structure of personal need for structure - A mixture-distribution Rasch analysis+Meiser, Thorsten; Machunsky, Maya+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT+2008::A Mixture Rasch Model With Item Response Time Components+Meyer, J.

We consider network panel data, a common form of longitudinal network data. In the framework of estimating functions, which includes the method of moments as well as the method of maximum likelihood, we propose score-type tests. The score-type tests share with other score-type tests, including the classic goodness-of-fit test of Pearson, the property that the score-type tests are based on comparing the observed value of a function of the data to values predicted by a model. The score-type tests are most useful in forward model selection and as tests of homogeneity assumptions, and possess substantial computational advantages. We derive one-step estimators which are useful as starting values of parameters in forward model selection and therefore complement the usefulness of the score-type tests. The finite-sample behaviour of the score-type tests is studied by Monte Carlo simulation and compared to t-type tests.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,ACTOR-ORIENTED MODELS,SOCIAL NETWORKS,RAO SCORE,INFERENCE","Schweinberger, Michael@Penn State Univ, Dept Stat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Schweinberger, Michael@Penn State University@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)",not exist,"Generalized score tests for composite hypotheses+Basawa, IV.+Estimating functions+1991::no title+BASAWA IV+P BERKELEY C HONOR J+1985::On some optimality properties of Fisher-Rao score function in testing and estimation+Bera, AK; Bilias, Y+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2001::Rao's score, Neyman's C(alpha) and Silvey's LM tests: an essay on historical developments and some new results+Bera, AK; Bilias, Y+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 2001::no title+EFRON B+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+1977::VERY LOCAL STRUCTURE IN SOCIAL NETWORKS+Faust, Katherine+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 2007, VOL 37+2007::Theory of statistical estimation.+Fisher, RA+PROCEEDINGS OF THE CAMBRIDGE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY+1925::no title+Freeman, L.+The development of social network analysis: A study in the sociology of science+2004::no title+GODAMBE, V.

Angoff's delta method revisited: Improving DIF detection under small samples,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02025.x,MAY 2012,59,10,"Most methods for detecting differential item functioning (DIF) are suitable when the sample sizes are sufficiently large to validate the null statistical distributions. There is no guarantee, however, that they will still perform adequately when there are few respondents in the focal group or in both the reference and the focal group. Angoff's delta plot is a potentially useful alternative for small-sample DIF investigation, but it suffers from an improper DIF flagging criterion. The purpose of this paper is to improve this classification rule under mild statistical assumptions. This improvement yields a modified delta plot with an adjusted DIF flagging criterion for small samples. A simulation study was conducted to compare the modified delta plot with both the classical delta plot approach and the MantelHaenszel method. It is concluded that the modified delta plot is consistently less conservative and more powerful than the usual delta plot, and is also less conservative and more powerful than the MantelHaenszel method as long as at least one group of respondents is small.",,"ITEM BIAS,WILLIAMS-SYNDROME,STANDARDIZATION APPROACH,SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE,PERFORMANCE,PHENOTYPE,CHILDREN,VALIDITY,ERROR,MODEL","Magis, David@Univ Liege, Dept Math B37, B-4000 Liege, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium::Facon, Bruno@Univ Lille Nord France, Lille, France","Magis, David@KU Leuven@University of Liege::Facon, Bruno@Universite de Lille@Universite Lille-Nord-de-France (ComUE)@Fondation I-SITE ULNE",not exist,"A Gender-Related Differential Item Functioning of Mathematics TestItems+Abedalaziz, N.+International Journal of Educational and Psychological Assessment+2010::A DIDACTIC EXPLANATION OF ITEM BIAS, ITEM IMPACT, AND ITEM VALIDITY FROM A MULTIDIMENSIONAL PERSPECTIVE+ACKERMAN, TA+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SPR 1992::Approximate is better than ""exact"" for interval estimation of binomial proportions+Agresti, A; Coull, BA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1998::no title+Agresti, A.+An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis.+1996::Perspectives on differential item functioning methodology+Angoff, W.

Explaining the harmonic sequence paradox,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02026.x,MAY 2012,7,0,"According to the harmonic sequence paradox, an expected utility decision makers willingness to pay for a gamble whose expected payoffs evolve according to the harmonic series is finite if and only if his marginal utility of additional income becomes zero for rather low payoff levels. Since the assumption of zero marginal utility is implausible for finite payoff levels, expected utility theory as well as its standard generalizations such as cumulative prospect theory are apparently unable to explain a finite willingness to pay. This paper presents first an experimental study of the harmonic sequence paradox. Additionally, it demonstrates that the theoretical argument of the harmonic sequence paradox only applies to time-patient decision makers, whereas the paradox is easily avoided if time-impatience is introduced.",,UNCERTAINTY,"Schmidt, Ulrich@Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany@Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany::Zimper, Alexander@Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa","Schmidt, Ulrich@University of Kiel@Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW)::Zimper, Alexander@University of Pretoria","Zimper, Alexander@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3730-3086","no title+Aliprantis, D.C.; Border, K.+Infinite Dimensional Analysis+2006::EXPOSITION OF A NEW THEORY ON THE MEASUREMENT OF RISK+Bernoulli, Daniel+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1954::no title+Billingsley, P.+Probability and Measure+1995::Harmonic sequence paradox+Blavatskyy, P+ECONOMIC THEORY+MAY 2006::Uncertainty in the Origin of Knowledge+Menger, Karl+ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATIONALOKONOMIE+1934::no title+SAVAGE, L.+The Foundations of Statistics+1954::ADVANCES IN PROSPECT-THEORY - CUMULATIVE REPRESENTATION OF UNCERTAINTY+TVERSKY, A; KAHNEMAN, D+JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY+OCT 1992"
A latent trait model for response times on tests employing the proportional hazards model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02032.x,MAY 2012,48,9,"For computer-administered tests, response times can be recorded conjointly with the corresponding responses. This broadens the scope of potential modelling approaches because response times can be analysed in addition to analysing the responses themselves. For this purpose, we present a new latent trait model for response times on tests. This model is based on the Cox proportional hazards model. According to this model, latent variables alter a baseline hazard function. Two different approaches to item parameter estimation are described: the first approach uses a variant of the Cox model for discrete time, whereas the second approach is based on a profile likelihood function. Properties of each estimator will be compared in a simulation study. Compared to the estimator for discrete time, the profile likelihood estimator is more efficient, that is, has smaller variance. Additionally, we show how the fit of the model can be evaluated and how the latent traits can be estimated. Finally, the applicability of the model to an empirical data set is demonstrated.",,"LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,LIMITED-INFORMATION,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,REGRESSION-MODELS,FRAILTY MODELS,ITEM,PARAMETER,FRAMEWORK,DISTRIBUTIONS","Ranger, Jochen@Univ Giessen, D-35390 Giessen, Germany::Ortner, Tuulia@Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Ranger, Jochen@Justus Liebig University Giessen::Ortner, Tuulia@Free University of Berlin","Ortner, Tuulia M.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5703-6915","A goodness of fit test for sparse 2(p) contingency tables+Bartholomew, DJ; Leung, SO+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2002::no title+Bartholomew, DJ; Knott, M.+Latent variable models and factor analysis+1999::The how and why of response latency measurement in telephone surveys+Bassili, J.

Accuracy in parameter estimation for ANCOVA and ANOVA contrasts: Sample size planning via narrow confidence intervals,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02029.x,MAY 2012,66,7,"Contrasts of means are often of interest because they describe the effect size among multiple treatments. High-quality inference of population effect sizes can be achieved through narrow confidence intervals (CIs). Given the close relation between CI width and sample size, we propose two methods to plan the sample size for an ANCOVA or ANOVA study, so that a sufficiently narrow CI for the population (standardized or unstandardized) contrast of interest will be obtained. The standard method plans the sample size so that the expected CI width is sufficiently small. Since CI width is a random variable, the expected width being sufficiently small does not guarantee that the width obtained in a particular study will be sufficiently small. An extended procedure ensures with some specified, high degree of assurance (e.g., 90% of the time) that the CI observed in a particular study will be sufficiently narrow. We also discuss the rationale and usefulness of two different ways to standardize an ANCOVA contrast, and compare three types of standardized contrast in the ANCOVA/ANOVA context. All of the methods we propose have been implemented in the freely available MBESS package in R so that they can be easily applied by researchers.",,"STANDARDIZED LINEAR CONTRASTS,STATISTICAL POWER,MEAN DIFFERENCES,PSYCHOLOGY,METAANALYSIS,COEFFICIENT,DIFFERENCE,PRECISION,METRICS,DESIGNS","Lai, Keke@Unknow::Kelley, Ken@Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Dept Management, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Lai, Keke@Unknow::Kelley, Ken@University of Notre Dame","Kelley, Ken@C-7322-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4756-8360","Power and money: Designing statistically powerful studies while minimizing financial costs+Allison, DB; Allison, RL; Faith, MS; et al.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 1997::no title+no author+Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association+2009::Understanding statistical power in the context of applied research+Baguley, T+APPLIED ERGONOMICS+MAR 2004::Standardized or simple effect size: What should be reported?+Baguley, Thom+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY+AUG 2009::Arbitrary metrics in psychology+Blanton, H; Jaccard, J+AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST+JAN 2006::Meta-analysis of raw mean differences+Bond, CF; Wiitala, WL; Richard, FD+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2003::Estimating Standardized Linear Contrasts of Means With Desired Precision+Bonett, Douglas G.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 2009::Confidence intervals for standardized linear contrasts of means+Bonett, Douglas G.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+JUN 2008::ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF ASSESSING MODEL FIT+BROWNE, MW; CUDECK, R+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+NOV 1992::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.L.+Statistical Inference+2002::no title+Cochran, W.

Logistic response models with item interactions,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2010.02009.x,FEB 2012,33,1,"Items that are clustered according to shared content may violate the principle of conditional independence commonly used in item response theory. This paper investigates the capabilities of a logistic item response model in relation to locally dependent item responses. The model includes main effect and interaction parameters that are computed as linear functions of the latent trait. The paper explains the interpretation of the parameters, the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm, the information matrix and some results concerning parameter identifiability. The problem of over-fitting the data is addressed in a simulation study, and two real data examples are described to illustrate the approach, one from the context of a sample survey and the other from ability testing using testlets.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION,LATENT TRAIT MODEL,RASCH MODEL,EM ALGORITHM,PARAMETERS,THEOREM,TESTS","Revuelta, Javier@Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Social Psychol & Methodol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain","Revuelta, Javier@Autonomous University of Madrid","Revuelta, Javier@Q-9641-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4705-6282","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::no title+Andersen, E.

Effect of non-normality on test statistics for one-way independent groups designs,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02014.x,FEB 2012,51,17,"The data obtained from one-way independent groups designs is typically non-normal in form and rarely equally variable across treatment populations (i.e. population variances are heterogeneous). Consequently, the classical test statistic that is used to assess statistical significance (i.e. the analysis of variance F test) typically provides invalid results (e.g. too many Type I errors, reduced power). For this reason, there has been considerable interest in finding a test statistic that is appropriate under conditions of non-normality and variance heterogeneity. Previously recommended procedures for analysing such data include the James test, the Welch test applied either to the usual least squares estimators of central tendency and variability, or the Welch test with robust estimators (i.e. trimmed means and Winsorized variances). A new statistic proposed by Krishnamoorthy, Lu, and Mathew, intended to deal with heterogeneous variances, though not non-normality, uses a parametric bootstrap procedure. In their investigation of the parametric bootstrap test, the authors examined its operating characteristics under limited conditions and did not compare it to the Welch test based on robust estimators. Thus, we investigated how the parametric bootstrap procedure and a modified parametric bootstrap procedure based on trimmed means perform relative to previously recommended procedures when data are non-normal and heterogeneous. The results indicated that the tests based on trimmed means offer the best Type I error control and power when variances are unequal and at least some of the distribution shapes are non-normal.",,"TRIMMED MEANS,MONTE-CARLO,ANOVA,VARIANCE,ROBUSTNESS,NORMALITY,HYPOTHESES,HETEROGENEITY,DISTRIBUTIONS,COVARIANCE","Cribbie, Robert A.@York Univ, Dept Psychol, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada::Fiksenbaum, Lisa@York Univ, Dept Psychol, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada::Keselman, H.

A procedure for isolating social desirability variance in a three-way component analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02015.x,FEB 2012,27,0,"Three-way component analysis aims to summarize all the information in a three-way data set related, for example, to the responses of individuals to a set of items in a set of situations. The data are decomposed into three component matrices (person, item and situation components) and a core matrix. Such data are generally obtained by means of a situation-response questionnaire administered to a sample of participants. This paper proposes a preprocessing procedure for controlling social desirability in these kinds of questionnaires. The essential idea is to isolate the variance due to social desirability response bias and remove it from the data set. The procedure is demonstrated through its empirical application in the personality domain. Its performance is also assessed by means of a simulation study which shows that the presence of social desirability bias in a data set had different consequences: (1) the variance effect due to persons increased, and the effect of the triple interaction persons x items x situations decreased; (2) the person component and core matrix were partially distorted. However, the social desirability bias in the data set was successfully controlled by our preprocessing method.",,"VARIABLES,ROTATION,MODELS,SCALE","Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Psychol, CRAMC Res Ctr Behav Assessment, Tarragona 43007, Spain::Ferrando, Pere J.@Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Psychol, CRAMC Res Ctr Behav Assessment, Tarragona 43007, Spain","Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@Universitat Rovira i Virgili::Ferrando, Pere J.@Universitat Rovira i Virgili","Ferrando, Pere@J-9857-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3133-5466::Lorenzo-Seva, Urbano@G-4228-2011::lorenzo-seva, Urbano@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5369-3099","Modeling Acquiescence in Measurement Models for Two Balanced Sets of Items+Billiet, Jaak B.; McClendon, Mckee J.+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+2000::Selecting among three-mode principal component models of different types and complexities: A numerical convex hull based method+Ceulemans, E; Kiers, HAL+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2006::An alternative method for evaluating congruence coefficients with procrustes rotation: A bootstrap procedure+Chan, W; Ho, RM; Leung, K; et al.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 1999::YEASAYERS AND NAYSAYERS - AGREEING RESPONSE SET AS A PERSONALITY VARIABLE+COUCH, A; KENISTON, K+JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+1960::no title+EDWARDS AL+RESPONSE SET PERSONA+1967::no title+Eysenck, H.

Quick approximation of bivariate functions,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2011.02016.x,FEB 2012,45,0,"This paper presents two experiments where participants had to approximate function values at various generalization points of a square, using given function values at a small set of data points. A representative set of standard function approximation models was trained to exactly fit the function values at data points, and models responses at generalization points were compared to those of humans. Then one defined a large class of possible models (including the best two identified predictors) and the class maximal possible prediction accuracy was evaluated. A new model of quick multivariate function approximation belonging to this class was proposed. Its prediction accuracy was close to the maximum possible, and significantly better than that of all other models tested. The new model also provided a significant account of human response variability. Finally, it was shown that this model is more particularly suitable for problems in which the visual system can perform some specific structuring of the data space. This model is therefore considered as a suitable starting point for further investigations into quick multivariate function approximation, which is to date an inadequately explored question in cognitive psychology.",,"FEEDFORWARD NEURAL NETWORKS,LEARNING-MODELS,SCATTERED DATA,INTERPOLATION,EXTRAPOLATION,PERFORMANCE,ALGORITHM,VALIDITY,SYSTEMS,SINGLE","Courrieu, Pierre@Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, Ctr St Charles, Lab Psychol Cognit,UMR 6146, F-13331 Marseille 03, France","Courrieu, Pierre@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Aix-Marseille Universite",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Single versus multiple systems of category learning: Reply to Nosofsky and Kruschke (2002)+Ashby, FG; Ell, SW+PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN &amp; REVIEW+MAR 2002::Interpolation of Lipschitz functions+Beliakov, Gleb+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS+NOV 1 2006::no title+Ben-israel, A; Greville, T.

Simulations are presented using the WilcoxonMannWhitney test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the KruskalWallis test, together with the rank transformations and t and F tests corresponding to each of those non-parametric methods. In addition to Type I errors and power over all simulations, the study examines the consistency of the outcomes of the two methods on each individual sample. The results show how acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis and differences in p-values of the test statistics depend in a regular and predictable way on sample size, significance level, and differences between means, for normal and various non-normal distributions.",,"FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,STATISTICS,HYPOTHESES,COVARIANCE,REGRESSION","Zimmerman, Donald W.@Carleton Univ, Surrey, BC V4A 6B6, Canada","Zimmerman, Donald W.@Carleton University",not exist,"Asymptotic theory of weighted F-statistics based on ranks+Akritas, M.

These problems encompass applications such as unidimensional scaling, paired-comparison ranking, and anti-Robinson forms. The importance of simultaneously incorporating multiple objective criteria in matrix permutation applications is well recognized in the literature; however, to date, there has been a reliance on weighted-sum approaches that transform the multiobjective problem into a single-objective optimization problem. Although exact solutions to these single-objective problems produce supported Pareto efficient solutions to the multiobjective problem, many interesting unsupported Pareto efficient solutions may be missed. We illustrate the limitation of the weighted-sum approach with an example from the psychological literature and devise an effective heuristic algorithm for estimating both the supported and unsupported solutions of the Pareto efficient set.",,"COMBINATORIAL DATA-ANALYSIS,PAIRED-COMPARISON RANKING,ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITY-MEASURES,NEAREST ADJOINING ORDERS,ALPHABETIC CONFUSION,BOUND ALGORITHM,SLATERS I,SERIATION,RECOGNITION,TACTILE","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Mkt, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Steinley, Douglas@Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State University@State University System of Florida::Steinley, Douglas@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"COMBINATORIAL DATA-ANALYSIS+ARABIE, P; HUBERT, LJ+ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY+1992::APPLICATIONS OF COMBINATORIAL PROGRAMMING TO DATA-ANALYSIS - SERIATION USING ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITY MEASURES+BAKER, FB; HUBERT, LJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1977::no title+Brusco, M.

Bootstrap standard error and confidence intervals for the correlations corrected for indirect range restriction,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/2044-8317.002007,NOV 2011,24,12,"The standard Pearson correlation coefficient, r, is a biased estimator of the population correlation coefficient, rho(XY), when predictor X and criterion Y are indirectly range-restricted by a third variable Z (or S). Two correction algorithms, Thorndike's (1949) Case III, and Schmidt, Oh, and Le's (2006) Case IV, have been proposed to correct for the bias. However, to our knowledge, the two algorithms did not provide a procedure to estimate the associated standard error and confidence intervals. This paper suggests using the bootstrap procedure as an alternative. Two Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to systematically evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed bootstrap procedure. The results indicated that the bootstrap standard error and confidence intervals were generally accurate across simulation conditions (e.g., selection ratio, sample size). The proposed bootstrap procedure can provide a useful alternative for the estimation of the standard error and confidence intervals for the correlation corrected for indirect range restriction.",,"METAANALYSIS,ACCURACY,VALIDITY,SELECTION","Li, Johnson Ching-hong@Univ Alberta, Dept Educ Psychol, Ctr Res Appl Measurement & Evaluat, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G5, Canada::Chan, Wai@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Cui, Ying@Univ Alberta, Dept Educ Psychol, Ctr Res Appl Measurement & Evaluat, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G5, Canada","Li, Johnson Ching-hong@University of Alberta::Chan, Wai@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Cui, Ying@University of Alberta","Li, Johnson Ching Hong@A-7642-2013","no title+no author+Publication manual of the American Psychological Association+2010::Large sample estimators for standard errors of functions of correlation coefficients+Bobko,, P.; Rieck,, A.+Applied Psychological Measurement+1980::no title+Bobko,, P.+Correlation and regression: Applications for industrial organizational psychology and management+2001::no title+Brockwell, P.; Davis, R.+INTRO TIME SERIES FO+2002::Bootstrap standard error and confidence intervals for the correlation corrected for range restriction: A simulation study+Chan, W; Chan, DWL+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2004::The accuracy of different methods for estimating the standard error of correlations corrected for range restriction+Duan, B; Dunlap, WP+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+APR 1997::no title+Efron, B.; Tibshirani, R.

A simple and effective decision rule for choosing a significance test to protect against non-normality,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X524739,NOV 2011,26,10,"There is no formal and generally accepted procedure for choosing an appropriate significance test for sample data when the assumption of normality is doubtful. Various tests of normality that have been proposed over the years have been found to have limited usefulness, and sometimes a preliminary test makes the situation worse. The present paper investigates a specific and easily applied rule for choosing between a parametric and non-parametric test, the Student t test and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, that does not require a preliminary significance test of normality. Simulations reveal that the rule, which can be applied to sample data automatically by computer software, protects the Type I error rate and increases power for various sample sizes, significance levels, and non-normal distribution shapes.

A closer look at the effect of preliminary goodness-of-fit testing for normality for the one-sample t-test,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/0007-1102.002003,NOV 2011,28,10,"Student's one-sample t-test is a commonly used method when inference about the population mean is made. As advocated in textbooks and articles, the assumption of normality is often checked by a preliminary goodness-of-fit (GOF) test. In a paper recently published by Schucany and Ng it was shown that, for the uniform distribution, screening of samples by a pretest for normality leads to a more conservative conditional Type I error rate than application of the one-sample t-test without preliminary GOF test. In contrast, for the exponential distribution, the conditional level is even more elevated than the Type I error rate of the t-test without pretest. We examine the reasons behind these characteristics. In a simulation study, samples drawn from the exponential, lognormal, uniform, Student's t-distribution with 2 degrees of freedom (t(2)) and the standard normal distribution that had passed normality screening, as well as the ingredients of the test statistics calculated from these samples, are investigated. For non-normal distributions, we found that preliminary testing for normality may change the distribution of means and standard deviations of the selected samples as well as the correlation between them (if the underlying distribution is non-symmetric), thus leading to altered distributions of the resulting test statistics. It is shown that for skewed distributions the excess in Type I error rate may be even more pronounced when testing one-sided hypotheses.",,"STATISTICAL ERRORS,VARIANCE,EQUALITY","Rochon, Justine@Univ Heidelberg, Inst Med Biometry & Informat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany::Kieser, Meinhard@Univ Heidelberg, Inst Med Biometry & Informat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Rochon, Justine@Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg::Kieser, Meinhard@Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg",not exist,"no title+Altman, D.

The method is developed within the framework of the popular latent variable modelling methodology. The approach is readily applicable for examining interrelationship indices between composite sum scores and criterion variables in two-level studies. The procedure is also useful for obtaining estimates and confidence intervals of criterion validity coefficients during the process of scale construction and development with hierarchical data.

Sample size planning with the cost constraint for testing superiority and equivalence of two independent groups,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X512408,NOV 2011,54,7,"The allocation of sufficient participants into different experimental groups for various research purposes under given constraints is an important practical problem faced by researchers. We address the problem of sample size determination between two independent groups for unequal and/or unknown variances when both the power and the differential cost are taken into consideration. We apply the well-known Welch approximate test to derive various sample size allocation ratios by minimizing the total cost or, equivalently, maximizing the statistical power. Two types of hypotheses including superiority/non-inferiority and equivalence of two means are each considered in the process of sample size planning. A simulation study is carried out and the proposed method is validated in terms of Type I error rate and statistical power. As a result, the simulation study reveals that the proposed sample size formulas are very satisfactory under various variances and sample size allocation ratios. Finally, a flowchart, tables, and figures of several sample size allocations are presented for practical reference.",,"BIOEQUIVALENCE TRIALS,POPULATION VARIANCES,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,STATISTICAL TESTS,CLINICAL-TRIALS,MONTE-CARLO,POWER,BIOAVAILABILITY,DIFFERENCE,ALLOCATION","Guo, Jiin-Huarng@Natl Pingtung Univ Educ, Dept Appl Math, Pingtung City, Taiwan::Chen, Hubert J.@Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accountancy, Tainan 701, Taiwan::Luh, Wei-Ming@Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Educ, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Guo, Jiin-Huarng@Unknow::Chen, Hubert J.@National Cheng Kung University::Luh, Wei-Ming@National Cheng Kung University",not exist,"Power and money: Designing statistically powerful studies while minimizing financial costs+Allison, DB; Allison, RL; Faith, MS; et al.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 1997::Assessing equivalence: An alternative to the use of difference tests for measuring disparities in vaccination coverage+Barker, LE; Luman, ET; McCauley, MM; et al.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 1 2002::Bioequivalence trials, intersection-union tests and equivalence confidence sets+Berger, RL; Hsu, JC+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 1996::Equivalence testing with dental clinical trials+Burns, DR; Elswick, RK+JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH+JUN 2001::The design of simulation studies in medical statistics+Burton, Andrea; Altman, Douglas G.; Royston, Patrick; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 30 2006::MMPI differences between alcoholics and drug abusers: effect of age and race+Cannon, D.S.; Bell, W.E.; Fowler, D.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Penk, R.; Finkelstein, W.E.; Allan, S</span>.+Psychol.

Clarifying the role of mean centring in multicollinearity of interaction effects,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2010.02002.x,NOV 2011,24,38,"Moderated multiple regression (MMR) is frequently employed to analyse interaction effects between continuous predictor variables. The procedure of mean centring is commonly recommended to mitigate the potential threat of multicollinearity between predictor variables and the constructed cross-product term. Also, centring does typically provide more straightforward interpretation of the lower-order terms. This paper attempts to clarify two methodological issues of potential confusion. First, the positive and negative effects of mean centring on multicollinearity diagnostics are explored. It is illustrated that the mean centring method is, depending on the characteristics of the data, capable of either increasing or decreasing various measures of multicollinearity. Second, the exact reason why mean centring does not affect the detection of interaction effects is given. The explication shows the symmetrical influence of mean centring on the corrected sum of squares and variance inflation factor of the product variable while maintaining the equivalence between the two residual sums of squares for the regression of the product term on the two predictor variables. Thus the resulting test statistic remains unchanged regardless of the obvious modification of multicollinearity with mean centring. These findings provide a clear understanding and demonstration on the diverse impact of mean centring in MMR applications.",,"MODERATED MULTIPLE-REGRESSION,MODELS,VARIABLES,DIAGNOSTICS","Shieh, Gwowen@Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Management Sci, Hsinchu 30050, Taiwan","Shieh, Gwowen@National Chiao Tung University","Shieh, Gwowen@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8611-4495","STATISTICAL POWER PROBLEMS WITH MODERATED MULTIPLE-REGRESSION IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH+AGUINIS, H+JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT+1995::no title+Aiken, L.

However, they prefer to model item response probabilities than to study the internal structure of cognitive attributes. The theory of conjoint measurement, via its unique capacity to detect the quantitative structure of non-extensive attributes, can be used for the latter purpose. It is shown that conjoint systems analogous to the numerical composition rules advanced by the Rasch, many facet Rasch and two-parameter logistic models can be formulated using well-established axioms, representation theorems and proofs. Examples using empirical and synthetic data are presented.

Constructing bootstrap confidence intervals for principal component loadings in the presence of missing data: A multiple-imputation approach,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2010.02006.x,NOV 2011,45,8,"Earlier research has shown that bootstrap confidence intervals from principal component loadings give a good coverage of the population loadings. However, this only applies to complete data. When data are incomplete, missing data have to be handled before analysing the data. Multiple imputation may be used for this purpose. The question is how bootstrap confidence intervals for principal component loadings should be corrected for multiply imputed data. In this paper, several solutions are proposed. Simulations show that the proposed corrections for multiply imputed data give a good coverage of the population loadings in various situations.",,"STANDARD ERRORS,QUESTIONNAIRE DATA,ROTATION,NUMBER,SCORES","van Ginkel, Joost R.@Leiden Univ, Fac Social & Behav Sci, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands::Kiers, Henk A.

Using SAS PROC TCALIS for multigroup structural equation modelling with mean structures,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2010.02012.x,NOV 2011,32,1,"Multigroup structural equation modelling (SEM) is a technique frequently used to evaluate measurement invariance in social and behavioural science research. Before version 9.2, SAS was incapable of handling multigroup SEM. However, this limitation is resolved in PROC TCALIS in SAS 9.2. For the purpose of illustration, this paper provides a step-by-step guide to programming the tests of measurement invariance and partial invariance using PROC TCALIS for multigroup SEM with mean structures. Fit indices and parameter estimates are validated, thus providing an alternative tool for researchers conducting both applied and simulated studies. Other new features (e.g., different types of modelling languages and estimation methods) and limitations (e.g., ordered-categorical SEM and multilevel SEM) of the TCALIS procedure are also briefly discussed.",,"OF-FIT INDEXES,MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE,COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES,FACTORIAL INVARIANCE,SENSITIVITY","Gu, Fei@Univ Kansas, Dept Psychol & Res Educ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA::Wu, Wei@Univ Kansas, Dept Psychol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Gu, Fei@University of Kansas::Wu, Wei@University of Kansas",not exist,"no title+ARBUCKLE JL+AMOS VERSION 5 0 COM+2003::no title+Bentler, P.

"Power comparisons of significance tests of location using scores, ranks, and modular ranks",BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X501671,MAY 2011,15,1,"The Type I error probability and the power of the independent samples t test, performed directly on the ranks of scores in combined samples in place of the original scores, are known to be the same as those of the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test. In the present study, simulations revealed that these probabilities remain essentially unchanged when the number of ranks is reduced by assigning the same rank to multiple ordered scores. For example, if 200 ranks are reduced to as few as 20, or 10, or 5 ranks by replacing sequences of consecutive ranks by a single number, the Type I error probability and power stay about the same. Significance tests performed on these modular ranks consistently reproduce familiar findings about the comparative power of the t test and the WMW tests for normal and various non-normal distributions. Similar results are obtained for modular ranks used in comparing the one-sample t test and the Wilcoxon signed ranks test.",,,"Zimmerman, Donald W.@Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Zimmerman, Donald W.@Carleton University",not exist,"no title+Andrews, D F; Bickel, P J; Hampel, F R.+A robust estimation of location: Survey and advances+1972::LIMITATIONS OF THE RANK TRANSFORM STATISTIC IN TESTS FOR INTERACTIONS+BLAIR, RC; SAWILOWSKY, SS; HIGGINS, JJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1987::RANK TRANSFORMATIONS AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN PARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+CONOVER, WJ; IMAN, RL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1981::OUTLIER-PRONE AND OUTLIER-RESISTANT DISTRIBUTIONS+GREEN, RF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1976::no title+Hajek,, J.; Sidak,, Z.; Sen,, P.

A comparison of two-stage procedures for testing least-squares coefficients under heteroscedasticity,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X508683,MAY 2011,32,8,"This study explores the performance of several two-stage procedures for testing ordinary least-squares (OLS) coefficients under heteroscedasticity. A test of the usual homoscedasticity assumption is carried out in the first stage of the procedure. Subsequently, a test of the regression coefficients is chosen and performed in the second stage. Three recently developed methods for detecting heteroscedasticity are examined. In addition, three heteroscedastic robust tests of OLS coefficients are considered. A major finding is that performing a test of heteroscedasticity prior to applying a heteroscedastic robust test can lead to poor control over Type I errors.",,"LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL,COVARIANCE-MATRIX,UNKNOWN FORM,HETEROSKEDASTICITY,VARIANCE,DIAGNOSTICS,ESTIMATORS,INFERENCE,ERRORS","Ng, Marie@Univ Washington, Inst Hlth Metr & Evaluat, Seattle, WA 98121 USA::Wilcox, Rand R.@Univ So Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Ng, Marie@Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation@University of Washington@University of Washington Seattle::Wilcox, Rand R.@University of Southern California","Wilcox, Rand@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2524-2976","SIMPLE TEST FOR HETEROSCEDASTICITY AND RANDOM COEFFICIENT VARIATION+BREUSCH, TS; PAGAN, AR+ECONOMETRICA+1979::TYPE-1 ERRORS AFTER PRELIMINARY TESTS FOR HETEROSCEDASTICITY+CAUDILL, SB+STATISTICIAN+1988::DIAGNOSTICS FOR HETEROSCEDASTICITY IN REGRESSION+COOK, RD; WEISBERG, S+BIOMETRIKA+1983::Asymptotic inference under heteroskedasticity of unknown form+Cribari-Neto, F+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 1 2004::Inference under heteroskedasticity and leveraged data (vol 36, pg 1877, 2007)+Cribari-Neto, Francisco; Souza, Tatiene C.; Vasconcellos, Klaus L.

Prompted by the approximate test statistics (Welch and Alexander-Govern methods), the authors develop four new heterogeneous test statistics to test factor A and factor B nested within A for the unbalanced fixed-effect two-stage nested design under variance heterogeneity. The actual significance levels and statistical power of the test statistics were compared in a simulation study. The results show that the proposed procedures maintain better Type I error rate control and have greater statistical power than those obtained by the conventional F test in various conditions. Therefore, the proposed test statistics are recommended in terms of robustness and easy implementation.",,"VARIANCE HETEROGENEITY,ANOVA,HETEROSCEDASTICITY,APPROXIMATION,NONNORMALITY","Guo, Jiin-Huarng@Natl Pingtung Univ Educ, Dept Appl Math, Pingtung City, Taiwan::Billard, L.@Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30602 USA::Luh, Wei-Ming@Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Educ, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Guo, Jiin-Huarng@Unknow::Billard, L.@University System of Georgia@University of Georgia::Luh, Wei-Ming@National Cheng Kung University",not exist,"A NEW AND SIMPLER APPROXIMATION FOR ANOVA UNDER VARIANCE HETEROGENEITY+ALEXANDER, RA; GOVERN, DM+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+SUM 1994::Generalized F-tests for unbalanced nested designs under heteroscedasticity+Ananda, MMA+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+DEC 1995::ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::A new test of linear hypotheses in OLS regression under heteroscedasticity of unknown form+Cai, Li; Hayes, Andrew F.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+MAR 2008::Optimal sampling designs for monitoring plant frequency+Heywood, John S.; DeBacker, Michael D.+RANGELAND ECOLOGY &amp; MANAGEMENT+JUL 2007::STUDENTS T-QUANTILES+HILL, GW+COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM+1970::no title+Johnson, N.

Simultaneous analysis of coupled data matrices subject to different amounts of noise,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X513263,MAY 2011,27,21,"In many areas of science, research questions imply the analysis of a set of coupled data blocks, with, for instance, each block being an experimental unit by variable matrix, and the variables being the same in all matrices. To obtain an overall picture of the mechanisms that play a role in the different data matrices, the information in these matrices needs to be integrated. This may be achieved by applying a data-analytic strategy in which a global model is fitted to all data matrices simultaneously, as in some forms of simultaneous component analysis (SCA). Since such a strategy implies that all data entries, regardless the matrix they belong to, contribute equally to the analysis, it may obfuscate the overall picture of the mechanisms underlying the data when the different data matrices are subject to different amounts of noise. One way out is to downweight entries from noisy data matrices in favour of entries from less noisy matrices. Information regarding the amount of noise that is present in each matrix, however, is, in most cases, not available. To deal with these problems, in this paper a novel maximum-likelihood-based simultaneous component analysis method, referred to as MxLSCA, is proposed. Being a stochastic extension of SCA, in MxLSCA the amount of noise in each data matrix is estimated and entries from noisy data matrices are downweighted. Both in an extensive simulation study and in an application to data stemming from cross-cultural emotion psychology, it is shown that the novel MxLSCA strategy outperforms the SCA strategy with respect to disclosing the mechanisms underlying the coupled data.",,"PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,COMMON FACTOR-ANALYSIS,MODEL,POPULATIONS,BIAS","Wilderjans, Tom F.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Ceulemans, Eva@Unknow::Van Mechelen, Iven@Unknow::van den Berg, Robert A.@Unknow","Wilderjans, Tom F.@KU Leuven::Ceulemans, Eva@Unknow::Van Mechelen, Iven@Unknow::van den Berg, Robert A.@Unknow","van den Berg, Robert@E-3238-2010::van den Berg, Robert A.@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2708-7890::Ceulemans, Eva@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7611-4683","Discriminating between strong and weak structures in three-mode principal component analysis+Ceulemans, Eva; Kiers, Henk A.

The effect of covariate mean differences on the standard error and confidence interval for the comparison of treatment means,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X526575,MAY 2011,13,2,"The use of covariates is commonly believed to reduce the unexplained error variance and the standard error for the comparison of treatment means, but the reduction in the standard error is neither guaranteed nor uniform over different sample sizes. The covariate mean differences between the treatment conditions can inflate the standard error of the covariate-adjusted mean difference and can actually produce a larger standard error for the adjusted mean difference than that for the unadjusted mean difference. When the covariate observations are conceived of as randomly varying from one study to another, the covariate mean differences can be related to a Hotelling's T2. Using this Hotelling's T2 statistic, one can always find a minimum sample size to achieve a high probability of reducing the standard error and confidence interval width for the adjusted mean difference.",,,"Liu, Xiaofeng Steven@Univ S Carolina, Dept Educ Studies, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Liu, Xiaofeng Steven@University of South Carolina Columbia@University of South Carolina System@University of South Carolina",not exist,"ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE - ITS NATURE AND USES+COCHRAN, WG+BIOMETRICS+1957::ESTABLISHING POSITIVE DEFINITENESS OF SAMPLE COVARIANCE MATRIX+DYKSTRA, RL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1970::no title+Kirk, R.

Sensitivity to initial values in full non-parametric maximum-likelihood estimation of the two-parameter logistic model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X531957,MAY 2011,34,1,"Parameters of the two-parameter logistic model are generally estimated via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm by the maximum-likelihood (ML) method. In so doing, it is beneficial to estimate the common prior distribution of the latent ability from data. Full non-parametric ML (FNPML) estimation allows estimation of the latent distribution with maximum flexibility, as the distribution is modelled non-parametrically on a number of (freely moving) support points. It is generally assumed that EM estimation of the two-parameter logistic model is not influenced by initial values, but studies on this topic are unavailable. Therefore, the present study investigates the sensitivity to initial values in FNPML estimation. In contrast to the common assumption, initial values are found to have notable influence: for a standard convergence criterion, item discrimination and difficulty parameter estimates as well as item characteristic curve (ICC) recovery were influenced by initial values. For more stringent criteria, item parameter estimates were mainly influenced by the initial latent distribution, whilst ICC recovery was unaffected. The reason for this might be a flat surface of the log-likelihood function, which would necessitate setting a sufficiently tight convergence criterion for accurate recovery of item parameters.",,"ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,EM ALGORITHM,MONTE-CARLO,RECOVERY,CURVES","Nader, Ingo W.@Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Dept Basic Psychol Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria::Tran, Ulrich S.@Unknow::Formann, Anton K.@Unknow","Nader, Ingo W.@University of Vienna::Tran, Ulrich S.@Unknow::Formann, Anton K.@Unknow",not exist,"THE ITEM LOG-LIKELIHOOD SURFACE FOR 2-PARAMETER AND 3-PARAMETER ITEM CHARACTERISTIC CURVE MODELS+BAKER, FB+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 1988::METHODOLOGY REVIEW - ITEM PARAMETER-ESTIMATION UNDER THE ONE PARAMETER LOGISTIC-MODELS+BAKER, FB+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUN 1987::THE SENSITIVITY OF LATENT TRAIT ANALYSIS TO CHOICE OF PRIOR DISTRIBUTION+BARTHOLOMEW, DJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 1988::Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::MARGINAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF ITEM PARAMETERS - APPLICATION OF AN EM ALGORITHM+BOCK, RD; AITKIN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1981::Item parameter estimation+Bock, RD.+ANN M AM ED RES ASS+1991::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::AN EVALUATION OF MARGINAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION FOR THE 2-PARAMETER LOGISTIC MODEL+DRASGOW, F+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 1989::no title+DUTOIT M+IRT SSI+2003::Structural latent class models+Formann, AK; Kohlmann, T+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+MAY 1998::Monte Carlo studies in item response theory+Harwell, M; Stone, CA; Hsu, TC; et al.+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUN 1996::On finite sequences of real numbers+Heywood, HB+PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-CONTAINING PAPERS OF A MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTER+DEC 1931::RECOVERY OF 2-PARAMETER AND 3-PARAMETER LOGISTIC ITEM CHARACTERISTIC CURVES - A MONTE-CARLO STUDY+HULIN, CL; LISSAK, RI; DRASGOW, F+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+1982::Choosing initial values for the EM algorithm for finite mixtures+Karlis, D; Xekalaki, E+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::The effect of error in item parameter estimates on the test response function method of linking+Kaskowitz, GS; De Ayala, RJ+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 2001::no title+KIM S+J EDUC MEAS+2006::Bootstrapping the estimated latent distribution of the two-parameter latent trait model+Knott, M.; Tzamourani, P.+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAY 2007::AN ANALYSIS OF VERBAL SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE TEST USING BIRNBAUMS 3-PARAMETER LOGISTIC MODEL+LORD, FM+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+1968::Initializing Partition-Optimization Algorithms+Maitra, Ranjan+IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS+JAN-MAR 2009::Mersenne Twister: a 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudo-random number generator+Matsumoto, M.; Nishimura, T.+ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation+Jan. 1998::THE UNICORN, THE NORMAL CURVE, AND OTHER IMPROBABLE CREATURES+MICCERI, T+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+JAN 1989::no title+Mislevy, R.

The necessary and sufficient conditions for the multivariate Bernoulli distribution to be equal to the extended Rasch model provide a new loglinear representation of the extended Rasch model. Conditions are also given under which the extended Rasch model is equal to the random effects Rasch model, and it is shown under what conditions the extended Rasch model is equal to a random effects Rasch model in which the underlying variable has a normal distribution. In addition, alternative models for the construction of likelihood ratio tests are proposed. One of these alternative models is Haberman's extended interaction model.

Testing overall and moderator effects in random effects meta-regression,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X522687,FEB 2011,45,50,"Random effects meta-regression is a technique to synthesize results of multiple studies. It allows for a test of an overall effect, as well as for tests of effects of study characteristics, that is, (discrete or continuous) moderator effects. We describe various procedures to test moderator effects: the z, t, likelihood ratio (LR), Bartlett-corrected LR (BcLR), and resampling tests. We compare the Type I error of these tests, and conclude that the common z test, and to a lesser extent the LR test, do not perform well since they may yield Type I error rates appreciably larger than the chosen alpha. The error rate of the resampling test is accurate, closely followed by the BcLR test. The error rate of the t test is less accurate but arguably tolerable. With respect to statistical power, the BcLR and t tests slightly outperform the resampling test. Therefore, our recommendation is to use either the resampling or the BcLR test. If these statistics are unavailable, then the t test should be used since it is certainly superior to the z test.",,"RANDOM-EFFECTS METAANALYSIS,SMALL SAMPLE INFERENCE,MIXED LINEAR-MODEL,ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE,LIKELIHOOD,HETEROGENEITY,COEFFICIENTS,DISORDERS,POWER","Huizenga, Hilde M.@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands::Visser, Ingmar@Unknow::Dolan, Conor V.@Unknow","Huizenga, Hilde M.@University of Amsterdam::Visser, Ingmar@Unknow::Dolan, Conor V.@Unknow","Visser, Ingmar@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3855-2778","Epilepsy in autism is associated with intellectual disability and gender: Evidence from a meta-analysis+Amiet, Claire; Gourfinkel-An, Isabelle; Bouzamondo, Anissa; et al.+BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY+OCT 1 2008::An empirical comparison of permutation methods for tests of partial regression coefficients in a linear model+Anderson, MJ; Legendre, P+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1999::ON THE LEVEL-ERROR AFTER BARTLETT ADJUSTMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO STATISTIC+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, OE+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1988::A RANDOM-EFFECTS REGRESSION-MODEL FOR METAANALYSIS+BERKEY, CS; HOAGLIN, DC; MOSTELLER, F; et al.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+FEB 28 1995::Meta-analysis of raw mean differences+Bond, CF; Wiitala, WL; Richard, FD+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2003::Specification and estimation of mean- and covariance-structure models+Browne, MW; Arminger, G.+HDB STAT MODELING SO+1995::A model for integrating fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects meta-analyses into structural equation modeling+Cheung, Mike W. -L.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2008::A POWER PRIMER+COHEN, J+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+JUL 1992::Effectiveness of the Triple P Positive Parenting Program on Parenting: A Meta-Analysis+de Graaf, Ireen; Speetjens, Paula; Smit, Filip; et al.+FAMILY RELATIONS+DEC 2008::Are Psychotic Psychopathology and Neurocognition Orthogonal?

Correcting an analysis of variance for clustering,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/j.2044-8317.2010.02005.x,FEB 2011,23,7,"A great deal of educational and social data arises from cluster sampling designs where clusters involve schools, classrooms, or communities. A mistake that is sometimes encountered in the analysis of such data is to ignore the effect of clustering and analyse the data as if it were based on a simple random sample. This typically leads to an overstatement of the precision of results and too liberal conclusions about precision and statistical significance of mean differences. This paper gives simple corrections to the test statistics that would be computed in an analysis of variance if clustering were (incorrectly) ignored. The corrections are multiplicative factors depending on the total sample size, the cluster size, and the intraclass correlation structure. For example, the corrected F statistic has Fisher's F distribution with reduced degrees of freedom. The corrected statistic reduces to the F statistic computed by ignoring clustering when the intraclass correlations are zero. It reduces to the F statistic computed using cluster means when the intraclass correlations are unity, and it is in between otherwise. A similar adjustment to the usual statistic for testing a linear contrast among group means is described.",,"GROUP-RANDOMIZED-TRIALS,INTRACLASS CORRELATION,RELATIVE EFFICIENCY,MULTICENTER TRIALS,SIZES","Hedges, Larry V.@Northwestern Univ, Dept Stat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA::Rhoads, Christopher H.@Unknow","Hedges, Larry V.@Northwestern University::Rhoads, Christopher H.@Unknow","Hedges, Larry@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7531-0631","School effects on psychological outcomes during adolescence+Anderman, EM+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY+DEC 2002::Increasing the degrees of freedom in existing group randomized trials - The df(*) approach+Blitstein, JL; Hannan, PJ; Murray, DM; et al.+EVALUATION REVIEW+JUN 2005::Using covariates to improve precision for studies that randomize schools to evaluate educational interventions+Bloom, Howard S.; Richburg-Hayes, Lashawn; Black, Alison Rebeck+EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION AND POLICY ANALYSIS+MAR 2007::SOME THEOREMS ON QUADRATIC FORMS APPLIED IN THE STUDY OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE PROBLEMS .1.

Bayesian estimation of semiparametric nonlinear dynamic factor analysis models using the Dirichlet process prior,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1348/000711010X497262,FEB 2011,70,24,"Parameters in time series and other dynamic models often show complex range restrictions and their distributions may deviate substantially from multivariate normal or other standard parametric distributions. We use the truncated Dirichlet process (DP) as a non-parametric prior for such dynamic parameters in a novel nonlinear Bayesian dynamic factor analysis model. This is equivalent to specifying the prior distribution to be a mixture distribution composed of an unknown number of discrete point masses (or clusters). The stick-breaking prior and the blocked Gibbs sampler are used to enable efficient simulation of posterior samples. Using a series of empirical and simulation examples, we illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach in approximating distributions of very diverse shapes.",,"STATE-SPACE MODELS,NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,POLYTOMOUS DATA,ITEM RESPONSE,TIME-SERIES,MIXTURES,MULTIVARIATE,REGRESSION,INFERENCE","Chow, Sy-Miin@Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA::Tang, Niansheng@Yunnan Univ, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China::Yuan, Ying@Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA::Song, Xinyuan@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Ma Liu Shui, Peoples R China::Zhu, Hongtu@Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Chow, Sy-Miin@University of North Carolina@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill::Tang, Niansheng@Yunnan University::Yuan, Ying@University of North Carolina@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill::Song, Xinyuan@Chinese University of Hong Kong::Zhu, Hongtu@University of North Carolina@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Tang, Niansheng@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7033-3845","Semiparametric Thurstonian models for recurrent choices: A Bayesian analysis+Ansari, Asim; Iyengar, Raghuram+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2006::MIXTURES OF DIRICHLET PROCESSES WITH APPLICATIONS TO BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS+ANTONIAK, CE+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::no title+Bartholomew, DJ; Knott, M.+Latent variable models and factor analysis+1999::Distributional assumptions of growth mixture models: Implications for overextraction of latent trajectory classes+Bauer, DJ; Curran, PJ+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2003::Representing psychological processes with dynamic factor models: Some promising uses and extensions of autoregressive moving average time series models+Browne, MW; Nesselroade, JR+CONTEMPORARY PSYCHOMETRICS: A FESTSCHRIFT FOR RODERICK P.

Cognitive diagnosis modelling incorporating item response times,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12114,MAY 2018,72,3,"To provide more refined diagnostic feedback with collateral information in item response times (RTs), this study proposed joint modelling of attributes and response speed using item responses and RTs simultaneously for cognitive diagnosis. For illustration, an extended deterministic input, noisy and' gate (DINA) model was proposed for joint modelling of responses and RTs. Model parameter estimation was explored using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The PISA 2012 computer-based mathematics data were analysed first. These real data estimates were treated as true values in a subsequent simulation study. A follow-up simulation study with ideal testing conditions was conducted as well to further evaluate model parameter recovery. The results indicated that model parameters could be well recovered using the MCMC approach.

A semi-parametric within-subject mixture approach to the analyses of responses and response times,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12117,MAY 2018,57,0,"In item response theory, modelling the item response times in addition to the item responses may improve the detection of possible between- and within-subject differences in the process that resulted in the responses. For instance, if respondents rely on rapid guessing on some items but not on all, the joint distribution of the responses and response times will be a multivariate within-subject mixture distribution. Suitable parametric methods to detect these within-subject differences have been proposed. In these approaches, a distribution needs to be assumed for the within-class response times. In this paper, it is demonstrated that these parametric within-subject approaches may produce false positives and biased parameter estimates if the assumption concerning the response time distribution is violated. A semi-parametric approach is proposed which resorts to categorized response times. This approach is shown to hardly produce false positives and parameter bias. In addition, the semi-parametric approach results in approximately the same power as the parametric approach.","item response theory,response times,mixture modelling","PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL,HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK,SLOW INTELLIGENCE,ACCURACY,SPEED,TESTS,DICHOTOMIZATION,INFORMATION,PERSONALITY,SPEEDEDNESS","Molenaar, Dylan@Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands::Bolsinova, Maria@Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands::Vermunt, Jeroen K.@Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands","Molenaar, Dylan@University of Amsterdam::Bolsinova, Maria@University of Amsterdam::Vermunt, Jeroen K.@Tilburg University","vermunt, jeroen@K-3680-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9053-9330","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::AN ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, GEP; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1964::Choosing the number of component clusters in the mixture-model using a new informational complexity criterion of the inverse-fisher information matrix+Bozdogan, H.+Information and classification, concepts, methods and applications+1993::MODEL SELECTION AND AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) - THE GENERAL-THEORY AND ITS ANALYTICAL EXTENSIONS+BOZDOGAN, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::WHAT ONE INTELLIGENCE-TEST MEASURES - A THEORETICAL ACCOUNT OF THE PROCESSING IN THE RAVEN PROGRESSIVE MATRICES TEST+CARPENTER, PA; JUST, MA; SHELL, P+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+JUL 1990::THE COST OF DICHOTOMIZATION+COHEN, J+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+1983::IRTrees: Tree-Based Item Response Models of the GLMM Family+De Boeck, Paul; Partchev, Ivailo+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+MAY 2012::Attempting to differentiate fast and slow intelligence: Using generalized item response trees to examine the role of speed on intelligence tests+DiTrapani, Jack; Jeon, Minjeong; De Boeck, Paul; et al.+INTELLIGENCE+MAY-JUN 2016::A Box-Cox normal model for response times+Entink, R.

Approximated adjusted fractional Bayes factors: A general method for testing informative hypotheses,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12110,MAY 2018,54,0,"Informative hypotheses are increasingly being used in psychological sciences because they adequately capture researchers' theories and expectations. In the Bayesian framework, the evaluation of informative hypotheses often makes use of default Bayes factors such as the fractional Bayes factor. This paper approximates and adjusts the fractional Bayes factor such that it can be used to evaluate informative hypotheses in general statistical models. In the fractional Bayes factor a fraction parameter must be specified which controls the amount of information in the data used for specifying an implicit prior. The remaining fraction is used for testing the informative hypotheses. We discuss different choices of this parameter and present a scheme for setting it. Furthermore, a software package is described which computes the approximated adjusted fractional Bayes factor. Using this software package, psychological researchers can evaluate informative hypotheses by means of Bayes factors in an easy manner. Two empirical examples are used to illustrate the procedure.","fractional Bayes factor,informative hypothesis,normal approximation,prior sensitivity","INEQUALITY CONSTRAINED HYPOTHESES,VARIABLE SELECTION,MODEL SELECTION,PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,LINEAR-MODELS,CONSISTENCY,DIMENSION,RATIO","Gu, Xin@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, Utrecht, Netherlands@Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Roxby Bldg, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England::Mulder, Joris@Tilburg Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, Tilburg, Netherlands::Hoijtink, Herbert@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, Utrecht, Netherlands@CITO Inst Educ Measurement, Arnhem, Netherlands","Gu, Xin@University of Liverpool@Utrecht University::Mulder, Joris@Tilburg University::Hoijtink, Herbert@Utrecht University",not exist,"no title+Barlow, RE; Bartholomew, DJ; Bremner, JM<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Brunk, HD</span>.+Statistical Inference under Order Restriction: Theory and Application of Isotonic Regression+1972::A TEST OF HOMOGENEITY FOR ORDERED ALTERNATIVES+BARTHOLOMEW, DJ+BIOMETRIKA+1959::Training samples in objective Bayesian model selection+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction+Berger, JO; Pericchi, LR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1996::Bayesian Evaluation of Constrained Hypotheses on Variances of Multiple Independent Groups+Boing-Messing, Florian; van Assen, Marcel A.

A note on the expected value of the Rand index,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12116,MAY 2018,37,0,"Two expectations of the adjusted Rand index (ARI) are compared. It is shown that the expectation derived by Morey and Agresti (1984, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 44, 33) under the multinomial distribution to approximate the exact expectation from the hypergeometric distribution (Hubert & Arabie, 1985, Journal of Classification, 2, 193) provides a poor approximation, and, in some cases, the difference between the two expectations can increase with the sample size. Proofs concerning the minimum and maximum difference between the two expectations are provided, and it is shown through simulation that the ARI can differ significantly depending on which expectation is used. Furthermore, when compared in a hypothesis testing framework, multinomial approximation overly favours the null hypothesis.","cluster agreement,Rand index","K-MEANS,CLUSTER-ANALYSIS,LOCAL OPTIMA,CHANCE AGREEMENT,VARIABLES,CLASSIFICATION,PARTITIONS,ALGORITHM,SELECTION,MATRICES","Steinley, Douglas@Univ Missouri, 210 McAlester Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA::Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Steinley, Douglas@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State University@State University System of Florida",not exist,"On similarity indices and correction for chance agreement+Albatineh, Ahmed N.; Niewiadomska-Bugaj, Magdalena; Mihalko, Daniel+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+SEP 2006::MEASURING AGREEMENT WHEN 2 OBSERVERS CLASSIFY PEOPLE INTO CATEGORIES NOT DEFINED IN ADVANCE+BRENNAN, RL; LIGHT, RJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1974::A variable neighborhood search method for generalized blockmodeling of two-mode binary matrices+Brusco, Michael; Steinley, Douglas+JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY+OCT 2007::MULTIOBJECTIVE BLOCKMODELING FOR SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS+Brusco, Michael; Doreian, Patrick; Steinley, Douglas; et al.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUL 2013::A Tabu-Search Heuristic for Deterministic Two-Mode Blockmodeling of Binary Network Matrices+Brusco, Michael; Steinley, Douglas+PSYCHOMETRIKA+OCT 2011::An Exact Algorithm for the Two-Mode KL-Means Partitioning Problem+Brusco, Michael J.; Doreian, Patrick+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+OCT 2015::A Comparison of Latent Class, K-Means, and K-Median Methods for Clustering Dichotomous Data+Brusco, Michael J.; Shireman, Emilie; Steinley, Douglas+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2017::Clustering binary data in the presence of masking variables+Brusco, MJ+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2004::Using Cohen's K for community detection in social networks+Hoffman,, M.; Steinley,, D.; Brusco,, M.

Two-Stage maximum likelihood estimation in the misspecified restricted latent class model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12119,MAY 2018,39,0,"The maximum likelihood classification rule is a standard method to classify examinee attribute profiles in cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs). Its asymptotic behaviour is well understood when the model is assumed to be correct, but has not been explored in the case of misspecified latent class models. This paper investigates the asymptotic behaviour of a two-stage maximum likelihood classifier under a misspecified CDM. The analysis is conducted in a general restricted latent class model framework addressing all types of CDMs. Sufficient conditions are proposed under which a consistent classification can be obtained by using a misspecified model. Discussions are also provided on the inconsistency of classification under certain model misspecification scenarios. Simulation studies and a real data application are conducted to illustrate these results. Our findings can provide some guidelines as to when a misspecified simple model or a general model can be used to provide a good classification result.","cognitive diagnosis,large sample theory,latent class model,maximum likelihood estimation,model misspecification,Q matrix","COGNITIVE DIAGNOSIS MODELS,CLASSIFICATION MODELS,DINA MODEL,VARIABLES","Wang, Shiyu@Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Wang, Shiyu@University System of Georgia@University of Georgia",not exist,"Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike,, H.+P 2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::LIMITING BEHAVIOR OF POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS WHEN MODEL IS INCORRECT+BERK, RH+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1966::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.

Approximations to the distribution of a test statistic in covariance structure analysis: A comprehensive study,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12123,MAY 2018,43,0,"In structural equationmodelling (SEM), a robust adjustment to the test statistic or to its reference distribution is needed when its null distribution deviates from a (2) distribution, which usually arises when data do not follow a multivariate normal distribution. Unfortunately, existing studies on this issue typically focus on only a few methods and neglect the majority of alternative methods in statistics. Existing simulation studies typically consider only non-normal distributions of data that either satisfy asymptotic robustness or lead to an asymptotic scaled (2) distribution. In this work we conduct a comprehensive study that involves both typical methods in SEM and less well-known methods from the statistics literature. We also propose the use of several novel non-normal data distributions that are qualitatively different from the non-normal distributions widely used in existing studies. We found that several under-studied methods give the best performance under specific conditions, but the Satorra-Bentler method remains the most viable method for most situations.","robust statistics,distribution of a quadratic form,Satorra-Bentler correction,saddle-point approximation,maximum likelihood","QUADRATIC-FORMS,NORMAL VARIABLES,NONNORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS,ROBUSTNESS,PERFORMANCE,SQUARES,MODELS","Wu, Hao@Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA","Wu, Hao@Boston College",not exist,"Plausible values for latent variables using Mplus+Asparouhov, T; Muthen, B.+Tech.

Extension of caution indices to mixed-format tests,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12124,MAY 2018,40,0,"Tatsuoka suggested several extended caution indices and their standardized versions, and these have been used as person-fit statistics by various researchers. However, these indices are only defined for tests with dichotomous items. This paper extends two of the popular standardized extended caution indices for use with polytomous items and mixed-format tests. Two additional new person-fit statistics are obtained by applying the asymptotic standardization of person-fit statistics for mixed-format tests. Detailed simulations are then performed to compute the Type I error rate and power of the four new person-fit statistics. Two real data illustrations follow. The new person-fit statistics appear to be satisfactory tools for assessing person fit for polytomous items and mixed-format tests.","caution index,person fit,(1) statistic,(2) statistic","PERSON-FIT STATISTICS,ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,NULL DISTRIBUTION,ADAPTIVE TESTS,TEST-SCORES,IRT MODELS,ABILITY","Sinharay, Sandip@Educ Testing Serv, 660 Rosedale Rd, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA","Sinharay, Sandip@Educational Testing Service (ETS)",not exist,"A Comparison of Item Fit Statistics for Mixed IRT Models+Chon, Kyong Hee; Lee, Won-Chan; Dunbar, Stephen B.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+FAL 2010::no title+Cizek, G.

Selecting polychoric instrumental variables in confirmatory factor analysis: An alternative specification test and effects of instrumental variables,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12128,MAY 2018,47,0,"The polychoric instrumental variable (PIV) approach is a recently proposed method to fit a confirmatory factor analysis model with ordinal data. In this paper, we first examine the small-sample properties of the specification tests for testing the validity of instrumental variables (IVs). Second, we investigate the effects of using different numbers of IVs. Our results show that specification tests derived for continuous data are extremely oversized at all sample sizes when applied to ordinal variables. Possible modifications for ordinal data are proposed in the present study. Simulation results show that the modified specification tests with all available IVs are able to detect model misspecification. In terms of estimation accuracy, the PIV approach where the IVs outnumber the endogenous variables by one produces a lower bias but a higher variation than the PIV approach with more IVs for correctly specified factor loadings at small samples.","ordinal data,polychoric correlation,Sargan's test,mean-scaled statistic,mean-and variance-adjusted statistic,model misspecification","STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,LEAST-SQUARES 2SLS,ORDINAL DATA,CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT,COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES,GENERALIZED-METHOD,QUADRATIC-FORMS,EM ALGORITHM,MONTE-CARLO","Jin, Shaobo@Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden::Cao, Chunzheng@Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Math & Stat, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Jin, Shaobo@Uppsala University::Cao, Chunzheng@Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology",not exist,"Extended mixture factor analysis model with covariates for mixed binary and continuous responses+An, Xinming; Bentler, Peter M.+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+SEP 20 2011::Instrumental variables estimation and inference in the presence of many exogenous regressors+Anatolyev, Stanislav+ECONOMETRICS JOURNAL+2013::LINEAR LATENT VARIABLE MODELS AND COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES+ANDERSON, TW+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 1989::no title+Asparouhov, T.; Muthen, B.+Simple second order chi-square correction+2010::Latent Variable Models and Factor Analysis: A Unified Approach, 3rd Edition+Bartholomew, D; Knott, M; Moustaki, I+LATENT VARIABLE MODELS AND FACTOR ANALYSIS: A UNIFIED APPROACH, 3RD EDITION+2011::Instrumental Variables and GMM: Estimation and Testing+Baum, C.F.; Schaffer, M.E.; Stillman, S.+Stata Journal+2003::On the rank of a matrix+Beesack,, P.

ANOVA and the variance homogeneity assumption: Exploring a better gatekeeper,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12103,FEB 2018,34,0,"Valid use of the traditional independent samples ANOVA procedure requires that the population variances are equal. Previous research has investigated whether variance homogeneity tests, such as Levene's test, are satisfactory as gatekeepers for identifying when to use or not to use the ANOVA procedure. This research focuses on a novel homogeneity of variance test that incorporates an equivalence testing approach. Instead of testing the null hypothesis that the variances are equal against an alternative hypothesis that the variances are not equal, the equivalence-based test evaluates the null hypothesis that the difference in the variances falls outside or on the border of a predetermined interval against an alternative hypothesis that the difference in the variances falls within the predetermined interval. Thus, with the equivalence-based procedure, the alternative hypothesis is aligned with the research hypothesis (variance equality). A simulation study demonstrated that the equivalence-based test of population variance homogeneity is a better gatekeeper for the ANOVA than traditional homogeneity of variance tests.","equivalence testing,homogeneity of variance,ANOVA,Levene's test","STATISTICAL-METHODS,PRELIMINARY TESTS,T-TEST,ROBUSTNESS,EQUALITY","Kim, Yoosun Jamie@York Univ, Dept Psychol, Quantitat Methods Program, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada::Cribbie, Robert A.@York Univ, Dept Psychol, Quantitat Methods Program, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","Kim, Yoosun Jamie@York University - Canada::Cribbie, Robert A.@York University - Canada",not exist,"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence - We need to report uncertain results and do it clearly+Alderson, P+BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+FEB 28 2004::THE EFFECTS OF VIOLATIONS OF ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE T-TEST+BONEAU, CA+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1960::ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::ROBUST TESTS FOR EQUALITY OF VARIANCES+BROWN, MB; FORSYTHE, AB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::Statistics for the reader: What to ask before believing the results+Choi,, P.

Improving precision of ability estimation: Getting more from response times,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12104,FEB 2018,35,0,"By considering information about response time (RT) in addition to response accuracy (RA), joint models for RA and RT such as the hierarchical model (van der Linden, 2007) can improve the precision with which ability is estimated over models that only consider RA. The hierarchical model, however, assumes that only the person's speed is informative of ability. This assumption of conditional independence between RT and ability given speed may be violated in practice, and ignores collateral information about ability that may be present in the residual RTs. We propose a posterior predictive check for evaluating the assumption of conditional independence between RT and ability given speed. Furthermore, we propose an extension of the hierarchical model that contains cross-loadings between ability and RT, which enables one to take additional collateral information about ability into account beyond what is possible in the standard hierarchical model. A Bayesian estimation procedure is proposed for the model. Using simulation studies, the performance of the model is evaluated in terms of parameter recovery, and the possible gain in precision over the standard hierarchical model andanRA-only model is considered. The model is applied to data from a high-stakes educational test.","collateral information,hierarchical model,item response theory,measurement precision,response times","CONDITIONAL-INDEPENDENCE,THEORY MODELS,ACCURACY,DISTRIBUTIONS,FRAMEWORK,TESTS,FIT","Bolsinova, Maria@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands::Tijmstra, Jesper@Tilburg Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, Tilburg, Netherlands","Bolsinova, Maria@University of Amsterdam::Tijmstra, Jesper@Tilburg University",not exist,"Reliability as a measurement design effect+Adams, R.

Standard errors and confidence intervals for correlations corrected for indirect range restriction: A simulation study comparing analytic and bootstrap methods,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12105,FEB 2018,25,0,"A frequent topic of psychological research is the estimation of the correlation between two variables from a sample that underwent a selection process based on a third variable. Due to indirect range restriction, the sample correlation is a biased estimator of the population correlation, and a correction formula is used. In the past, bootstrap standard error and confidence intervals for the corrected correlations were examined with normal data. The present study proposes a large-sample estimate (an analytic method) for the standard error, and a corresponding confidence interval for the corrected correlation. Monte Carlo simulation studies involving both normal and non-normal data were conducted to examine the empirical performance of the bootstrap and analytic methods. Results indicated that with both normal and non-normal data, the bootstrap standard error and confidence interval were generally accurate across simulation conditions (restricted sample size, selection ratio, and population correlations) and outperformed estimates of the analytic method. However, with certain combinations of distribution type and model conditions, the analytic method has an advantage, offering reasonable estimates of the standard error and confidence interval without resorting to the bootstrap procedure's computer-intensive approach. We provide SAS code for the simulation studies.","bootstrap,confidence intervals,correlation,range restriction,standard error,validity","EXPLICIT SELECTION,DISTRIBUTIONS,ASSUMPTIONS,ROBUSTNESS,ACCURACY","Kennet-Cohen, Tamar@Natl Inst Testing & Evaluat, Jerusalem, Israel::Kleper, Dvir@Natl Inst Testing & Evaluat, Jerusalem, Israel::Turvall, Elliot@Natl Inst Testing & Evaluat, Jerusalem, Israel","Kennet-Cohen, Tamar@Unknow::Kleper, Dvir@Unknow::Turvall, Elliot@Unknow",not exist,"STANDARD ERRORS OF CORRELATIONS ADJUSTED FOR INCIDENTAL SELECTION+ALLEN, NL; DUNBAR, SB+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 1990::no title+no author+Standards for educational and psychological testing+2014::Testing the Significance of a Correlation With Nonnormal Data: Comparison of Pearson, Spearman, Transformation, and Resampling Approaches+Bishara, Anthony J.; Hittner, James B.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2012::Large sample estimators for standard errors of functions of correlation coefficients+Bobko,, P.; Rieck,, A.+Applied Psychological Measurement+1980::UNIVARIATE SELECTION - EFFECTS OF SIZE OF CORRELATION, DEGREE OF SKEW, AND DEGREE OF RESTRICTION+BREWER, JK; HILLS, JR+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1969::Bootstrap standard error and confidence intervals for the correlation corrected for range restriction: A simulation study+Chan, W; Chan, DWL+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2004::CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS MEASURED ON SAME INDIVIDUALS+DUNN, OJ; CLARK, V+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::no title+Fisher, R.

Sample size determination for a matched-pairs study with incomplete data using exact approach,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12107,FEB 2018,35,2,"This research was motivated by a clinical trial design for a cognitive study. The pilot study was a matched-pairs design where some data are missing, specifically the missing data coming at the end of the study. Existing approaches to determine sample size are all based on asymptotic approaches (e.g., the generalized estimating equation(GEE) approach). When the sample size in a clinical trial is small to medium, these asymptotic approaches may not be appropriate for use due to the unsatisfactory Type I and II error rates. For this reason, we consider the exact unconditional approach to compute the sample size for a matched-pairs study with incomplete data. Recommendations are made for each possible missingness pattern by comparing the exact sample sizes based on three commonly used test statistics, with the existing sample size calculation based on the GEE approach. An example from a real surgeon-reviewers study is used to illustrate the application of the exact sample size calculation in study designs.","cognitive study,exact approach,incomplete data,missing completely at random,paired data,sample size","PREVENTION INSTRUMENT PROJECT,CLINICAL-TRIALS,MCNEMAR TEST,EXACT TESTS,BINARY DATA,END-POINTS,DEMENTIA,PROPORTIONS,POWER,EFFICIENT","Shan, Guogen@Univ Nevada, Sch Community Hlth Sci, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Epidemiol & Biostat Program, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA::Bernick, Charles@Cleveland Clin, Lou Ruvo Ctr Brain Hlth, Las Vegas, NV USA::Banks, Sarah@Cleveland Clin, Lou Ruvo Ctr Brain Hlth, Las Vegas, NV USA","Shan, Guogen@Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE)@University of Nevada Las Vegas::Bernick, Charles@Cleveland Clinic Foundation::Banks, Sarah@Cleveland Clinic Foundation",not exist,"The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Prevention Instrument Project: Longitudinal Outcome of Behavioral Measures as Predictors of Cognitive Decline+Banks, Sarah Jane;

Circular interpretation of regression coefficients,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12108,FEB 2018,25,1,"The interpretation of the effect of predictors in projected normal regression models is not straight-forward. The main aim of this paper is to make this interpretation easier such that these models can be employed more readily by social scientific researchers. We introduce three new measures: the slope at the inflection point (b(c)), average slope (AS) and slope at mean (SAM) that help us assess the marginal effect of a predictor in a Bayesian projected normal regression model. The SAM or AS are preferably used insituations where the data for a specific predictor do not lie close to the inflection point of a circular regression curve. In this case b(c) is an unstable and extrapolated effect. In addition, we outline how the projected normal regression model allows us to distinguish between an effect on the mean and spread of a circular outcome variable. We call these types of effects location and accuracy effects, respectively. The performance of the three new measures and of the methods to distinguish between location and accuracy effects is investigated in a simulation study. We conclude that the new measures and methods to distinguish between accuracy and location effects work well insituations with a clear location effect. In situations where the location effect is not clearly distinguishable from an accuracy effect not all measures work equally well and we recommend the use of the SAM.","Bayesian analysis,circular regression,projected normal distribution","PROJECTED NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION,DIRECTIONAL-DATA,MODELS,SYNCHRONIZATION,DISORDER,SUBTYPES","Cremers, Jolien@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, Utrecht, Netherlands::Mulder, Kees Tim@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, Utrecht, Netherlands::Klugkist, Irene@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, Utrecht, Netherlands@Univ Twente, Res Methodol, Measurement & Data Anal, Behav Sci, Enschede, Netherlands","Cremers, Jolien@Utrecht University::Mulder, Kees Tim@Utrecht University::Klugkist, Irene@University of Twente@Utrecht University",not exist,"The map in our head is not oriented north: Evidence from a real-world environment+Brunye,, T.

Testing autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation: Asymptotic methods versus resampling techniques,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12109,FEB 2018,31,0,"Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation, which provide a mathematical tool to understand repeating patterns in time series data, are often used to facilitate the identification of model orders of time series models (e.g., moving average and autoregressive models). Asymptotic methods for testing autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation such as the 1/T approximation method and the Bartlett's formula method may fail in finite samples and are vulnerable to non-normality. Resampling techniques such as the moving block bootstrap and the surrogate data method are competitive alternatives. In this study, we use a Monte Carlo simulation study and a real data example to compare asymptotic methods with the aforementioned resampling techniques. For each resampling technique, we consider both the percentile method and the bias-corrected and accelerated method for interval construction. Simulation results show that the surrogate data method with percentile intervals yields better performance than the other methods. An R package pautocorr is used to carry out tests evaluated in this study.","nonnormality,R package pautocorr,tests of autocorrelations,tests of partial autocorrelations,the surrogate data method,vectorized moving block bootstrap","AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES,MOVING AVERAGE ORDER,PIERCE Q-TEST,UNIT-ROOT,BOOTSTRAP,STATISTICS,JACKKNIFE","Ke, Zijun@Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Social Cognit Neurosci & M, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China@Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Brain Funct & Dis, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China::Zhang, Zhiyong (Johnny)@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Ke, Zijun@Sun Yat Sen University::Zhang, Zhiyong (Johnny)@University of Notre Dame","Zhang, Zhiyong@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0590-2196","no title+Bartlett, M.

Direction of dependence in measurement error models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12111,FEB 2018,65,3,"Methods to determine the direction of a regression line, that is, to determine the direction of dependence in reversible linear regression models (e.g., xy vs. yx), have experienced rapid development within the last decade. However, previous research largely rested on the assumption that the true predictor is measured without measurement error. The present paper extends the direction dependence principle to measurement error models. First, we discuss asymmetric representations of the reliability coefficient in terms of higher moments of variables and the attenuation of skewness and excess kurtosis due to measurement error. Second, we identify conditions where direction dependence decisions are biased due to measurement error and suggest method of moments (MOM) estimation as a remedy. Third, we address data situations in which the true outcome exhibits both regression and measurement error, and propose a sensitivity analysis approach to determining the robustness of direction dependence decisions against unreliably measured outcomes. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the performance of MOM-based direction dependence measures and their robustness to violated measurement error assumptions (i.e., non-independence and non-normality). An empirical example from subjective well-being research is presented. The plausibility of model assumptions and links to modern causal inference methods for observational data are discussed.","direction dependence,linear regression,measurement error,method of moments,non-normality,sensitivity analysis","LINEAR-REGRESSION MODELS,VARIABLES,KURTOSIS,SKEWNESS,SUBJECT,TESTS,FIT","Wiedermann, Wolfgang@Univ Missouri, Dept Educ Sch & Counseling Psychol, Columbia, MO USA::Merkle, Edgar C.@Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol Sci, Columbia, MO USA::von Eye, Alexander@Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Wiedermann, Wolfgang@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::Merkle, Edgar C.@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System::von Eye, Alexander@Michigan State University","Wiedermann, Wolfgang@H-2203-2018::Merkle, Edgar@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7158-0653","A Problem in Least Squares+Adcock, R.

"Mathematical transcription of the ""time-based resource sharing' theory of working memory",BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12112,FEB 2018,36,0,"The time-based resource sharing (TBRS) model is a prominent model of working memory that is both predictive and simple. TBRS is a mainstream decay-based model and the most susceptible to competition with interference-based models. A connectionist implementation of TBRS, TBRS*, has recently been developed. However, TBRS* is an enriched version of TBRS, making it difficult to test general characteristics resulting from TBRS assumptions. Here, we describe a novel model, TBRS2, built to be more transparent and simple than TBRS*. TBRS2 is minimalist and allows only a few parameters. It is a straightforward mathematical transcription of TBRS that focuses exclusively on the activation level of memory items as a function of time. Its simplicity makes it possible to derive several theorems from the original TBRS and allows several variants of the refresh process to be tested without relying on particular architectures.","decay,interference,memory span,modeling,short-term memory,tbrs,working memory","GENERAL FLUID INTELLIGENCE,SHORT-TERM-MEMORY,LATENT-VARIABLE ANALYSIS,SPAN TASKS,CAPACITY,DECAY,INTERFERENCE,CONSTRAINTS,INFORMATION,CHUNKING","Gauvrit, Nicolas@Pract Sch High Studies, Human & Artificial Cognit Lab, Paris, France::Mathy, Fabien@Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France","Gauvrit, Nicolas@Unknow::Mathy, Fabien@University of Nice Sophia Antipolis","Gauvrit, Nicolas@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3248-9368","Working memory: Looking back and looking forward+Baddeley, A+NATURE REVIEWS NEUROSCIENCE+OCT 2003::Time constraints and resource sharing in adults' working memory spans+Barrouillet, P; Bernardin, S; Camos, V+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL+MAR 2004::The time-based resource-sharing model of working memory+Barrouillet, P; Camos, V.+The cognitive neuroscience of working memory+2007::As Time Goes By: Temporal Constraints in Working Memory+Barrouillet, Pierre; Camos, Valerie+CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE+DEC 2012::Working Memory Span Development: A Time-Based Resource-Sharing Model Account+Barrouillet, Pierre; Gavens, Nathalie; Vergauwe, Evie; et al.+DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY+MAR 2009::On the proper reading of the TBRS model: reply to Oberauer and Lewandowsky (2014)+Barrouillet, Pierre; Camos, Valerie+FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 21 2014::On the Law Relating Processing to Storage in Working Memory+Barrouillet, Pierre; Portrat, Sophie; Camos, Valerie+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+APR 2011::EXPONENTIAL DECAY OF SPATIAL MEMORY OF RATS IN A RADIAL MAZE+BOLHUIS, JJ; BIJLSMA, S; ANSMINK, P+BEHAVIORAL AND NEURAL BIOLOGY+SEP 1986::The role of frontopolar cortex in subgoal processing during working memory+Braver, TS; Bongiolatti, SR+NEUROIMAGE+MAR 2002::no title+Burnham, K.

Asymptotic confidence intervals for the Pearson correlation via skewness and kurtosis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12113,FEB 2018,38,0,"When bivariate normality is violated, the default confidence interval of the Pearson correlation can be inaccurate. Two new methods were developed based on the asymptotic sampling distribution of Fisher's z under the general case where bivariate normality need not be assumed. In Monte Carlo simulations, the most successful of these methods relied on the (Vale & Maurelli, 1983, Psychometrika, 48, 465) family to approximate a distribution via the marginal skewness and kurtosis of the sample data. In Simulation 1, this method provided more accurate confidence intervals of the correlation in non-normal data, at least as compared to no adjustment of the Fisher z interval, or to adjustment via the sample joint moments. In Simulation 2, this approximate distribution method performed favourably relative to common non-parametric bootstrap methods, but its performance was mixed relative to an observed imposed bootstrap and two other robust methods (PM1 and HC4). No method was completely satisfactory. An advantage of the approximate distribution method, though, is that it can be implemented even without access to raw data if sample skewness and kurtosis are reported, making the method particularly useful for meta-analysis.

Regression away from the mean: Theory and examples,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12106,FEB 2018,66,0,"Using a standard repeated measures model with arbitrary true score distribution and normal error variables, we present some fundamental closed-form results which explicitly indicate the conditions under which regression effects towards (RTM) and away from the mean are expected. Specifically, we show that for skewed and bimodal distributions many or even most cases will show a regression effect that is in expectation away from the mean, or that is not just towards but actually beyond the mean. We illustrate our results in quantitative detail with typical examples from experimental and biometric applications, which exhibit a clear regression away from the mean (egression from the mean') signature. We aim not to repeal cautionary advice against potential RTM effects, but to present a balanced view of regression effects, based on a clear identification of the conditions governing the form that regression effects take in repeated measures designs.","bimodality,measurement error,non-normality,regression towards the mean,repeated measures,skewed distributions","DISTRIBUTIONS,MODEL,UNIVERSAL,COGNITION,PROPERTY,SACCADES,TIMES","Schwarz, Wolf@Univ Potsdam, Dept Psychol, POB 60 15 53, D-14415 Potsdam, Germany::Reike, Dennis@Univ Potsdam, Dept Psychol, POB 60 15 53, D-14415 Potsdam, Germany","Schwarz, Wolf@University of Potsdam::Reike, Dennis@University of Potsdam",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.; Finlay, B.+Statistical methods for the social sciences+2009::no title+Agresti, A.; Franklin, C.+Statistics: The Art and Science of Learning from Data+2009::PSYCHOPHYSICAL AND SACCADIC INFORMATION ABOUT DIRECTION FOR BRIEFLY PRESENTED VISUAL TARGETS+AITSEBAOMO, AP; BEDELL, HE+VISION RESEARCH+SEP 1992::no title+Armitage, P; Berry, G; Matthews, JNS.+STAT METHODS MED RES+2002::Probability and Statistical Inference, 2nd Edition+Bartoszynski, R; NiewiadomskaBugaj, M+PROBABILITY AND STATISTICAL INFERENCE, 2ND EDITION+2008::APPLICATIONS OF LAGGED NORMAL DENSITY CURVE AS A MODEL FOR ARTERIAL DILUTION CURVES+BASSINGT.JB; ACKERMAN, FH; WOOD, EH+CIRCULATION RESEARCH+1966::COMPARING METHODS OF MEASUREMENT - WHY PLOTTING DIFFERENCE AGAINST STANDARD METHOD IS MISLEADING+BLAND, JM; ALTMAN, DG+LANCET+OCT 21 1995::no title+Bland,, M.+An introduction to medical statistics+2008::no title+Bulmer,, M.+Galton: Pioneer of heredity and biometry+2003::Flatfoot diagnosis by a unique bimodal distribution of footprint index in children.+Chang, Chia-Hsieh; Chen, Yu-Chen; Yang, Wen-Tien; et al.+PloS one+2014::Non-normal variation and regression to the mean.+Chesher, A+Statistical methods in medical research+1997-Jun::The impact and implication of regression to the mean on the design and analysis of medical investigations.+Chuang-Stein, C; Tong, D M+Statistical methods in medical research+1997-Jun::no title+CISNEROS LL+REV BRAS FISIOTER+2010::REGRESSION TO THE MEAN - A CONFUSED CONCEPT+CLARKE, ADB; CLARKE, AM; BROWN, RI+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY+1960::Using regression models for prediction: shrinkage and regression to the mean.+Copas, J B+Statistical methods in medical research+1997-Jun::NOTES ON ANALYSIS OF MIXED FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS+COX, DR+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1966::Are we witnessing the decline effect in the Type D personality literature?

Population models and simulation methods: The case of the Spearman rank correlation,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12085,NOV 2017,40,0,"The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of a population model in guiding the design and interpretation of simulation studies used to investigate the Spearman rank correlation. The Spearman rank correlation has been known for over a hundred years to applied researchers and methodologists alike and is one of the most widely used non-parametric statistics. Still, certain misconceptions can be found, either explicitly or implicitly, in the published literature because a population definition for this statistic is rarely discussed within the social and behavioural sciences. By relying on copula distribution theory, a population model is presented for the Spearman rank correlation, and its properties are explored both theoretically and in a simulation study. Through the use of the Iman-Conover algorithm (which allows the user to specify the rank correlation as a population parameter), simulation studies from previously published articles are explored, and it is found that many of the conclusions purported in them regarding the nature of the Spearman correlation would change if the data-generation mechanism better matched the simulation design. More specifically, issues such as small sample bias and lack of power of the t-test and r-to-z Fisher transformation disappear when the rank correlation is calculated from data sampled where the rank correlation is the population parameter. A proof for the consistency of the sample estimate of the rank correlation is shown as well as the flexibility of the copula model to encompass results previously published in the mathematical literature.","Spearman rank correlation,rank correlation,Monte Carlo simulation,copula,simulation design","MULTIVARIATE NONNORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS,POWER METHOD,RHO,TRANSFORMATION,STATISTICS,UNIVARIATE,VARIANCE,PEARSON,TESTS","Astivia, Oscar L.

Rank-based permutation approaches for non-parametric factorial designs,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12089,NOV 2017,50,1,"Inference methods for null hypotheses formulated in terms of distribution functions in general non-parametric factorial designs are studied. The methods can be applied to continuous, ordinal or even ordered categorical data in a unified way, and are based only on ranks. In this set-up Wald-type statistics and ANOVA-type statistics are the current state of the art. The first method is asymptotically exact but a rather liberal statistical testing procedure for small to moderate sample size, while the latter is only an approximation which does not possess the correct asymptotic level under the null. To bridge these gaps, a novel permutation approach is proposed which can be seen as a flexible generalization of the Kruskal-Wallis test to all kinds of factorial designs with independent observations. It is proven that the permutation principle is asymptotically correct while keeping its finite exactness property when data are exchangeable. The results of extensive simulation studies foster these theoretical findings. A real data set exemplifies its applicability.","factorial designs,heteroscedasticity,Kruskal-Wallis test,non-parametrics,permutation methods,unbalanced designs,Wald-type statistic","BEHRENS-FISHER PROBLEM,MULTIPLE COMPARISON PROCEDURES,LINEAR-REGRESSION,UNIFIED APPROACH,TESTS,HYPOTHESES,STATISTICS","Umlauft, Maria@Ulm Univ, Inst Stat, Helmholtzstr 20, D-89081 Ulm, Germany::Konietschke, Frank@Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Math Sci, Richardson, TX 75083 USA::Pauly, Markus@Ulm Univ, Inst Stat, Helmholtzstr 20, D-89081 Ulm, Germany","Umlauft, Maria@Ulm University::Konietschke, Frank@University of Texas Dallas@University of Texas System::Pauly, Markus@Ulm University",not exist,"Nonparametric hypotheses and rank statistics for unbalanced factorial designs+Akritas, MG; Arnold, SF; Brunner, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::FULLY NONPARAMETRIC HYPOTHESES FOR FACTORIAL-DESIGNS .1.

Order-constrained linear optimization,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12090,NOV 2017,26,2,"Despite the fact that data and theories in the social, behavioural, and health sciences are often represented on an ordinal scale, there has been relatively little emphasis on modelling ordinal properties. The most common analytic framework used in psychological science is the general linear model, whose variants include ANOVA, MANOVA, and ordinary linear regression. While these methods are designed to provide the best fit to the metric properties of the data, they are not designed to maximally model ordinal properties. In this paper, we develop an order-constrained linear least-squares (OCLO) optimization algorithm that maximizes the linear least-squares fit to the data conditional on maximizing the ordinal fit based on Kendall's . The algorithm builds on the maximum rank correlation estimator (Han, 1987, Journal of Econometrics, 35, 303) and the general monotone model (Dougherty & Thomas, 2012, Psychological Review, 119, 321). Analyses of simulated data indicate that when modelling data that adhere to the assumptions of ordinary least squares, OCLO shows minimal bias, little increase in variance, and almost no loss in out-of-sample predictive accuracy. In contrast, under conditions in which data include a small number of extreme scores (fat-tailed distributions), OCLO shows less bias and variance, and substantially better out-of-sample predictive accuracy, even when the outliers are removed. We show that the advantages of OCLO over ordinary least squares in predicting new observations hold across a variety of scenarios in which researchers must decide to retain or eliminate extreme scores when fitting data.","regression,semi-parametric,general monotone model,maximum rank correlation estimator","RANK CORRELATION ESTIMATOR,MODEL","Tidwell, Joe W.@Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, Biol Psychol Bldg,4094 Campus Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA::Dougherty, Michael R.@Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, Biol Psychol Bldg,4094 Campus Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA::Chrabaszcz, Jeffrey S.@Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, Biol Psychol Bldg,4094 Campus Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA::Thomas, Rick P.@Georgia Inst Technol, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Tidwell, Joe W.@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park::Dougherty, Michael R.@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park::Chrabaszcz, Jeffrey S.@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park::Thomas, Rick P.@University System of Georgia@Georgia Institute of Technology","Dougherty, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9547-1937","Herding and Homicide Across Nations+Altheimer, Irshad+HOMICIDE STUDIES+FEB 2013::Beyond linearity by default: Generalized additive models+Beck, N; Jackman, S+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE+APR 1998::Skewness and Kurtosis in Real Data Samples+Blanca, Maria J.; Arnau, Jaume; Lopez-Montiel, Dolores; et al.+METHODOLOGY-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RESEARCH METHODS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES+2013::no title+Chrabaszcz, J.

CDF-quantile distributions for modelling random variables on the unit interval,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12091,NOV 2017,41,1,"This paper introduces a two-parameter family of distributions for modelling random variables on the (0,1) interval by applying the cumulative distribution function of one 'parent' distribution to the quantile function of another. Family members have explicit probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions and quantiles in a location parameter and a dispersion parameter. They capture a wide variety of shapes that the beta and Kumaraswamy distributions cannot. They are amenable to likelihood inference, and enable a wide variety of quantile regression models, with predictors for both the location and dispersion parameters. We demonstrate their applicability to psychological research problems and their utility in modelling real data.","density estimation,quantile regression,quantile function,unit interval","CONTINUOUS BOUNDED RESPONSES,BETA-REGRESSION,PROPORTIONS,DISPERSION,SELECTION,RATES","Smithson, Michael@Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia::Shou, Yiyun@Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Smithson, Michael@Australian National University::Shou, Yiyun@Australian National University","Shou, Yiyun@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7386-0031","On generating T-X family of distributions using quantile functions+Aljarrah, M.

Analysis of categorical moderators in mixed-effects meta-analysis: Consequences of using pooled versus separate estimates of the residual between-studies variances,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12092,NOV 2017,22,1,"Subgroup analyses allow us to examine the influence of a categorical moderator on the effect size in meta-analysis. We conducted a simulation study using a dichotomous moderator, and compared the impact of pooled versus separate estimates of the residual between-studies variance on the statistical performance of the Q(B(P)) and Q(B(S)) tests for subgroup analyses assuming a mixed-effects model. Our results suggested that similar performance can be expected as long as there are at least 20 studies and these are approximately balanced across categories. Conversely, when subgroups were unbalanced, the practical consequences of having heterogeneous residual between-studies variances were more evident, with both tests leading to the wrong statistical conclusion more often than in the conditions with balanced subgroups. A pooled estimate should be preferred for most scenarios, unless the residual between-studies variances are clearly different and there are enough studies in each category to obtain precise separate estimates.","meta-analysis,mixed-effects model,subgroup analysis,between-studies variance",EFFECTS META-REGRESSION,"Rubio-Aparicio, Maria@Univ Murcia, Dept Basic Psychol & Methodol, Fac Psychol, Espinardo Campus, E-30100 Murcia, Spain::Sanchez-Meca, Julio@Univ Murcia, Dept Basic Psychol & Methodol, Fac Psychol, Espinardo Campus, E-30100 Murcia, Spain::Antonio Lopez-Lopez, Jose@Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol, Avon, England::Botella, Juan@Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Social Psychol & Methodol, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain::Marin-Martinez, Fulgencio@Univ Murcia, Dept Basic Psychol & Methodol, Fac Psychol, Espinardo Campus, E-30100 Murcia, Spain","Rubio-Aparicio, Maria@University of Murcia::Sanchez-Meca, Julio@University of Murcia::Antonio Lopez-Lopez, Jose@University of Bristol::Botella, Juan@Autonomous University of Madrid::Marin-Martinez, Fulgencio@University of Murcia","Botella, Juan@B-7595-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8633-4981","no title+Borenstein, M; Higgins, J; Rothstein, H.+Comprehensive meta-analysis+2005::no title+Borenstein, M; Hedges L, V.; Higgins, JPT<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Rothstein, HR</span>.+Comprehensive meta analysis (Version 3.3)+2014::no title+Borenstein, M.; Hedges, L.

The assessment of knowledge and learning in competence spaces: The gain-loss model for dependent skills,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12095,NOV 2017,33,1,"The gain-loss model (GaLoM) is a formal model for assessing knowledge and learning. In its original formulation, the GaLoM assumes independence among the skills. Such an assumption is not reasonable in several domains, in which some preliminary knowledge is the foundation for other knowledge. This paper presents an extension of the GaLoM to the case in which the skills are not independent, and the dependence relation among them is described by a well-graded competence space. The probability of mastering skills at the pretest is conditional on the presence of all skills on which s depends. The probabilities of gaining or losing skill s when moving from pretest to posttest are conditional on the mastery of s at the pretest, and on the presence at the posttest of all skills on which s depends. Two formulations of the model are presented, in which the learning path is allowed to change from pretest to posttest or not. A simulation study shows that models based on the true competence space obtain a better fit than models based on false competence spaces, and are also characterized by a higher assessment accuracy. An empirical application shows that models based on pedagogically sound assumptions about the dependencies among the skills obtain a better fit than models assuming independence among the skills.","gain-loss model,skill dependence,learning process,competence structure,knowledge space",,"Anselmi, Pasquale@Univ Padua, Dept FISPPA, Via Venezia 8, I-35131 Padua, Italy::Stefanutti, Luca@Univ Padua, Dept FISPPA, Via Venezia 8, I-35131 Padua, Italy::de Chiusole, Debora@Univ Padua, Dept FISPPA, Via Venezia 8, I-35131 Padua, Italy::Robusto, Egidio@Univ Padua, Dept FISPPA, Via Venezia 8, I-35131 Padua, Italy","Anselmi, Pasquale@University of Padua::Stefanutti, Luca@University of Padua::de Chiusole, Debora@University of Padua::Robusto, Egidio@University of Padua",not exist,"A procedure for identifying the best skill multi map in the gain-loss model+Anselmi, P.; Robusto, E.; Stefanutti, L.+Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics+2013::Uncovering the Best Skill Multimap by Constraining the Error Probabilities of the Gain-Loss Model+Anselmi, Pasquale; Robusto, Egidio; Stefanutti, Luca+PSYCHOMETRIKA+OCT 2012::Applying cognition-based assessment to elementary school students' development of understanding of area and volume measurement+Battista, M.

Person-specific versus multilevel autoregressive models: Accuracy in parameter estimates at the population and individual levels,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12096,NOV 2017,39,0,"This paper compares the multilevel modelling (MLM) approach and the person-specific (PS) modelling approach in examining autoregressive (AR) relations with intensive longitudinal data. Two simulation studies are conducted to examine the influences of sample heterogeneity, time series length, sample size, and distribution of individual level AR coefficients on the accuracy of AR estimates, both at the population level and at the individual level. It is found that MLM generally outperforms the PS approach under two conditions: when the sample has a homogeneous AR pattern, namely, when all individuals in the sample are characterized by AR processes with the same order; and when the sample has heterogeneous AR patterns, but a multilevel model with a sufficiently high order (i.e., an order equal to or higher than the maximum order of individual AR patterns in the sample) is fitted and successfully converges. If a lower-order multilevel model is chosen for heterogeneous samples, the higher-order lagged effects are misrepresented, resulting in bias at the population level and larger prediction errors at the individual level. In these cases, the PS approach is preferable, given sufficient measurement occasions (T >= 50). In addition, sample size and distribution of individual level AR coefficients do not have a large impact on the results. Implications of these findings on model selection and research design are discussed.","autoregressive models,multilevel modelling,person-specific,time series,intensive longitudinal data","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,UNIFIED SEM,TIME,SELECTION,SEARCH","Liu, Siwei@Univ Calif Davis, Human Dev & Family Studies, Dept Human Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Liu, Siwei@University of California Davis@University of California System",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Fundamental diagnostics for two-level mixed models: The SAS macro MIXED_DX+Bell, B.

Non-ignorable missingness item response theory models for choice effects in examinee-selected items,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12097,NOV 2017,51,2,"Examinee-selected item (ESI) design, in which examinees are required to respond to a fixed number of items in a given set, always yields incomplete data (i.e., when only the selected items are answered, data are missing for the others) that are likely non-ignorable in likelihood inference. Standard item response theory (IRT) models become infeasible when ESI data are missing not at random (MNAR). To solve this problem, the authors propose a two-dimensional IRT model that posits one unidimensional IRT model for observed data and another for nominal selection patterns. The two latent variables are assumed to follow a bivariate normal distribution. In this study, the mirt freeware package was adopted to estimate parameters. The authors conduct an experiment to demonstrate that ESI data are often non-ignorable and to determine how to apply the new model to the data collected. Two follow-up simulation studies are conducted to assess the parameter recovery of the new model and the consequences for parameter estimation of ignoring MNAR data. The results of the two simulation studies indicate good parameter recovery of the new model and poor parameter recovery when non-ignorable missing data were mistakenly treated as ignorable.","choice effect,examinee-selected items,missing not at random,multidimensional item response theory","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,TESTS,PARAMETERS,CATEGORIES,QUESTIONS,RECOVERY","Liu, Chen-Wei@Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Wang, Wen-Chung@Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Liu, Chen-Wei@Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK)::Wang, Wen-Chung@Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK)","Wang, Wen-Chung@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6022-1567","Measuring the benefits of examinee-selected questions+Allen, NL; Holland, PW; Thayer, DT+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SPR 2005::RATING FORMULATION FOR ORDERED RESPONSE CATEGORIES+ANDRICH, D+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1978::no title+Board, C.+Test analysis: Advanced Placement chemistry+2006::no title+Board, C.+Test analysis: Advanced Placement European history+2010::MARGINAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF ITEM PARAMETERS - APPLICATION OF AN EM ALGORITHM+BOCK, RD; AITKIN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1981::ESTIMATING ITEM PARAMETERS AND LATENT ABILITY WHEN RESPONSES ARE SCORED IN 2 OR MORE NOMINAL CATEGORIES+BOCK, RD+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1972::Item response theory models applied to data allowing examinee choice+Bradlow, ET; Thomas, N+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+FAL 1998::Choice among essay topics: Impact on performance and validity+Bridgeman, B; Morgan, R; Wang, MM+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+FAL 1997::mirt: A Multidimensional Item Response Theory Package for the R Environment+Chalmers, R.

More efficient parameter estimates for factor analysis of ordinal variables by ridge generalized least squares,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12098,NOV 2017,62,0,"Data in psychology are often collected using Likert-type scales, and it has been shown that factor analysis of Likert-type data is better performed on the polychoric correlation matrix than on the product-moment covariance matrix, especially when the distributions of the observed variables are skewed. In theory, factor analysis of the polychoric correlation matrix is best conducted using generalized least squares with an asymptotically correct weight matrix (AGLS). However, simulation studies showed that both least squares (LS) and diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) perform better than AGLS, and thus LS or DWLS is routinely used in practice. In either LS or DWLS, the associations among the polychoric correlation coefficients are completely ignored. To mend such a gap between statistical theory and empirical work, this paper proposes new methods, called ridge GLS, for factor analysis of ordinal data. Monte Carlo results show that, for a wide range of sample sizes, ridge GLS methods yield uniformly more accurate parameter estimates than existing methods (LS, DWLS, AGLS). A real-data example indicates that estimates by ridge GLS are 9-20% more efficient than those by existing methods. Rescaled and adjusted test statistics as well as sandwich-type standard errors following the ridge GLS methods also perform reasonably well.","polychoric correlation,rescaled and adjusted test statistics,root mean square error,sandwich-type standard error","CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS,STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,ITEM FACTOR-ANALYSIS,COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,FULL-INFORMATION ESTIMATION,TEST STATISTICS,LIMITED-INFORMATION,CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT,CATEGORICAL VARIABLES","Yuan, Ke-Hai@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Indiana, PA USA::Jiang, Ge@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Indiana, PA USA::Cheng, Ying@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Indiana, PA USA","Yuan, Ke-Hai@University of Notre Dame::Jiang, Ge@University of Notre Dame::Cheng, Ying@University of Notre Dame",not exist,"THE SENSITIVITY OF CONFIRMATORY MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD FACTOR-ANALYSIS TO VIOLATIONS OF MEASUREMENT SCALE AND DISTRIBUTIONAL ASSUMPTIONS+BABAKUS, E; FERGUSON, CE; JORESKOG, KG+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+MAY 1987::Relative Performance of Categorical Diagonally Weighted Least Squares and Robust Maximum Likelihood Estimation+Bandalos, Deborah L.+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+JAN 2 2014::On the performance of maximum likelihood versus means and variance adjusted weighted least squares estimation in CFA+Beauducel, A; Herzberg, PY+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+2006::no title+Bentler, P.

Penalized partial likelihood inference of proportional hazards latent trait models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12080,MAY 2017,38,1,"The Cox proportional hazards model with a latent trait variable (Ranger & Ortner, 2012, Br. J. Math. Stat. Psychol., 65, 334) has shown promise in accounting for the dependency of response times from the same examinee. The model allows flexibility in shapes of response time distributions using the non-parametric baseline hazard rate while allowing parametric inference about the latent variable via exponential regression. The flexibility of the model, however, comes at the price of a significant increase in the complexity of estimating the model. The purpose of this study is to propose a new estimation approach to overcome this difficulty in model estimation. The new procedure is based on the penalized partial likelihood estimator in which the partial likelihood is maximized in the presence of a penalty function. The potential of the proposed method is corroborated by a series of simulation studies for fitting the proportional hazards latent trait model to psychological and educational testing data. The application of the estimation method to the hierarchical framework (van der Linden, 2007, Psychometrika, 72, 287) is also illustrated for jointly analysing response times and accuracy scores.","response time model,Cox proportional hazards model,penalized partial likelihood estimation","RESPONSE-TIMES,HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK,REGRESSION-MODELS,EM ALGORITHM,TESTS,ACCURACY,FRAILTY","Kang, Hyeon-Ah@Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA","Kang, Hyeon-Ah@Columbia University",not exist,"A version of the EM algorithm for proportional hazard model with random effects+Abrahantes, JC; Burzykowski, T+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+DEC 2005::Generating survival times to simulate Cox proportional hazards models+Bender, R; Augustin, T; Blettner, M+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUN 15 2005::Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum,, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::COVARIANCE ANALYSIS OF CENSORED SURVIVAL DATA+BRESLOW, N+BIOMETRICS+1974::Contribution to the discussion of the paper by D.

"Analysing model fit of psychometric process models: An overview, a new test and an application to the diffusion model",BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12082,MAY 2017,43,1,"Cognitive psychometric models embed cognitive process models into a latent trait framework in order to allow for individual differences. Due to their close relationship to the response process the models allow for profound conclusions about the test takers. However, before such a model can be used its fit has to be checked carefully. In this manuscript we give an overview over existing tests of model fit and show their relation to the generalized moment test of Newey (Econometrica, 53, 1985, 1047) and Tauchen (J.Econometrics, 30, 1985, 415). We also present a new test, the Hausman test of misspecification (Hausman, Econometrica, 46, 1978, 1251). The Hausman test consists of a comparison of two estimates of the same item parameters which should be similar if the model holds. The performance of the Hausman test is evaluated in a simulation study. In this study we illustrate its application to two popular models in cognitive psychometrics, the Q-diffusion model and the D-diffusion model (van der Maas, Molenaar, Maris, Kievit, & Boorsboom, Psychol Rev., 118, 2011, 339; Molenaar, Tuerlinckx, & van der Maas, J. Stat. Softw., 66, 2015, 1). We also compare the performance of the test to four alternative tests of model fit, namely the M-2 test (Molenaar etal., J. Stat. Softw., 66, 2015, 1), the moment test (Ranger etal., Br. J. Math. Stat. Psychol., 2016) and the test for binned time (Ranger & Kuhn, Psychol. Test. Asess. Model., 56, 2014b, 370). The simulation study indicates that the Hausman test is superior to the latter tests. The test closely adheres to the nominal Type I error rate and has higher power in most simulation conditions.","cognitive psychometrics,model fit,diffusion model","RESPONSE THEORY MODELS,INFORMATION ESTIMATION,LIMITED-INFORMATION,DECISION-MAKING,TIMES,PARAMETERS,DISTRIBUTIONS,FRAMEWORK,MEMORY,SPEED","Ranger, Jochen@Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Germany::Kuhn, Joerg-Tobias@Univ Munster, Munster, Germany::Szardenings, Carsten@Univ Munster, Munster, Germany","Ranger, Jochen@Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg::Kuhn, Joerg-Tobias@University of Munster::Szardenings, Carsten@University of Munster","Szardenings, Carsten@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1650-2705","no title+Batchelder, W.+Cognitive psychometrics: Combining two psychological traditions+2007::ASYMPTOTICALLY DISTRIBUTION-FREE METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES+BROWNE, MW+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1984::THE USE OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES IN X2 TESTS FOR GOODNESS OF FIT+CHERNOFF, H; LEHMANN, EL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1954::Comparison of multivariate distributions using quantile-quantile plots and related tests+Dhar, Subhra Sankar; Chakraborty, Biman; Chaudhuri, Probal+BERNOULLI+AUG 2014::Frequentist model-fit tests+Glas, C.+HDB ITEM RESPONSE TH+2016::SPECIFICATION TESTS IN ECONOMETRICS+HAUSMAN, JA+ECONOMETRICA+1978::Goodness-of-fit measures for latent variable models for binary data+Mavridis, D.; Moustaki, I.; Knott, M.+HDB LATENT VARIABLE+2007::Limited- and full-information estimation and goodness-of-fit testing in 2(n) contingency tables: A unified framework+Maydeu-Olivares, A; Joe, H+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2005::Goodness-of-Fit Assessment of Item Response Theory Models+Maydeu-Olivares, Alberto+MEASUREMENT-INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AND PERSPECTIVES+2013::Fitting Diffusion Item Response Theory Models for Responses and Response Times Using the R Package diffIRT+Molenaar, Dylan; Tuerlinckx, Francis; van der Maas, Han L.

Spontaneous and imposed speed of cognitive test responses,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12094,MAY 2017,38,4,"Based on data from a cognitive test presented in a condition with time constraints per item and a condition without time constraints, the effect of speed on accuracy is investigated. First, if the effect of imposed speed on accuracy is negative it can be explained by the speed-accuracy trade-off, and if it can be captured through the corresponding latent variables, then measurement invariance applies between a condition with and a condition without time constraints. The results do show a negative effect and a lack of measurement invariance. Second, the conditional accuracy function (CAF) is investigated in both conditions, with and without time constraints. The CAF shows an (item-dependent) negative conditional dependence between response time and response accuracy and thus a positive relationship between speed and accuracy, which implies that faster responses are more accurate. In sum, there seem to be two kinds of speed effects: a speed-accuracy trade-off effect induced by imposed speed and an opposite CAF effect associated with speed within conditions. The second effect is interpreted as stemming from a within-person variation of the cognitive capacity during the test which simultaneously favours or disfavours speed and accuracy.","cognitive tests,speed,accuracy","INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES,SLOW INTELLIGENCE,TIME LIMITS,MODELS,PSYCHOLOGY,ACCURACY,TASK","De Boeck, Paul@Ohio State Univ, 232 Lazenby Hall,1827 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium::Chen, Haiqin@Amer Dent Assoc, Chicago, IL USA::Davison, Mark@Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA","De Boeck, Paul@KU Leuven@Ohio State University::Chen, Haiqin@Unknow::Davison, Mark@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System",not exist,"Speed and accuracy indicators of test performance under different instructional conditions: Intelligence correlates+Ackerman, Phillip L.; Ellingsen, Victor J.+INTELLIGENCE+MAY-JUN 2016::Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4+Bates, Douglas; Maechler, Martin; Bolker, Benjamin M.; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+OCT 2015::An experimental analysis of the contributions of speed and level in an intelligence test+Baxter, B+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY+1941::no title+Bennett, G.

Modelling individual response time effects between and within experimental speed conditions: A GLMM approach for speeded tests,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12099,MAY 2017,45,1,"Completing test items under multiple speed conditions avoids the performance measure being confounded with individual differences in the speed-accuracy compromise, and offers insights into the response process, that is, how response time relates to the probability of a correct response. This relation is traditionally represented by two conceptually different functions: the speed-accuracy trade-off function (SATF) across conditions relating the condition average response time to the condition average of accuracy, and the conditional accuracy function (CAF) within a condition describing accuracy conditional on response time. Using a generalized linear mixed modelling approach, we propose an item response modelling framework that is suitable for item response and response time data from experimental speed conditions. The proposed SATF and CAF model accommodates response time effects between conditions (i.e., person and item SATF slope) and within conditions (i.e., residual CAF slopes), captures person and item differences in these effects, and is suitable for measures with a strong speed component. Moreover, for a single condition a CAF model is proposed distinguishing person, item and residual CAF. The properties of the models are illustrated with an empirical example.","conditional accuracy function,generalized linear mixed modelling,random response time effects,speed-accuracy trade-off function","LINEAR MIXED MODELS,TRADE-OFF,ACCURACY,INFORMATION,ABILITY,LIMITS,TASK,LME4,AGE","Goldhammer, Frank@German Inst Int Educ Res DIPF, Schlossstr 29, D-60486 Frankfurt, Germany@Ctr Int Student Assessment ZIB eV, Frankfurt, Germany::Steinwascher, Merle A.@Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany::Kroehne, Ulf@German Inst Int Educ Res DIPF, Schlossstr 29, D-60486 Frankfurt, Germany::Naumann, Johannes@Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany","Goldhammer, Frank@German Institute for International Educational Research::Steinwascher, Merle A.@University of Mannheim::Kroehne, Ulf@German Institute for International Educational Research::Naumann, Johannes@Goethe University Frankfurt",not exist,"Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items+Baayen, R.

Response moderation models for conditional dependence between response time and response accuracy,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12076,MAY 2017,21,4,"It is becoming more feasible and common to register response times in the application of psychometric tests. Researchers thus have the opportunity to jointly model response accuracy and response time, which provides users with more relevant information. The most common choice is to use the hierarchical model (van der Linden, 2007, Psychometrika, 72, 287), which assumes conditional independence between response time and accuracy, given a person's speed and ability. However, this assumption may be violated in practice if, for example, persons vary their speed or differ in their response strategies, leading to conditional dependence between response time and accuracy and confounding measurement. We propose six nested hierarchical models for response time and accuracy that allow for conditional dependence, and discuss their relationship to existing models. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed hierarchical models allow for various forms of conditional dependence in the model and allow the effect of continuous residual response time on response accuracy to be item-specific, person-specific, or both. Estimation procedures for the models are proposed, as well as two information criteria that can be used for model selection. Parameter recovery and usefulness of the information criteria are investigated using simulation, indicating that the procedure works well and is likely to select the appropriate model. Two empirical applications are discussed to illustrate the different types of conditional dependence that may occur in practice and how these can be captured using the proposed hierarchical models.","conditional independence,hierarchical model,moderation effect,residual dependence,response times","HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK,DISTRIBUTIONS","Bolsinova, Maria@Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands::Tijmstra, Jesper@Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands::Molenaar, Dylan@Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Bolsinova, Maria@University of Amsterdam::Tijmstra, Jesper@Tilburg University::Molenaar, Dylan@University of Amsterdam",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION OF NORMAL OGIVE ITEM RESPONSE CURVES USING GIBBS SAMPLING+ALBERT, JH+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+FAL 1992::Modeling conditional dependence between response time and accuracy+Bolsinova, M.; de Boeck, P.; Tijmstra, J.+Psychometrika+2016::Can Response Speed Be Fixed Experimentally, and Does This Lead to Unconfounded Measurement of Ability?+Bolsinova, Maria; Tijmstra, Jesper+MEASUREMENT-INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AND PERSPECTIVES+2015::EXPLAINING THE GIBBS SAMPLER+CASELLA, G; GEORGE, EI+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1992::STOCHASTIC RELAXATION, GIBBS DISTRIBUTIONS, AND THE BAYESIAN RESTORATION OF IMAGES+GEMAN, S; GEMAN, D+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+1984::Measuring Ability, Speed, or Both?

"Parameter recovery, bias and standard errors in the linear ballistic accumulator model",BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12100,MAY 2017,36,0,"The linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model (Brown & Heathcote, , Cogn. Psychol., 57, 153) is increasingly popular in modelling response times from experimental data. An R package, glba, has been developed to fit the LBA model using maximum likelihood estimation which is validated by means of a parameter recovery study. At sufficient sample sizes parameter recovery is good, whereas at smaller sample sizes there can be large bias in parameters. In a second simulation study, two methods for computing parameter standard errors are compared. The Hessian-based method is found to be adequate and is (much) faster than the alternative bootstrap method. The use of parameter standard errors in model selection and inference is illustrated in an example using data from an implicit learning experiment (Visser etal., , Mem. Cogn., 35, 1502). It is shown that typical implicit learning effects are captured by different parameters of the LBA model.","linear ballistic accumulator model,parameter recovery,parameter bias,standard error,maximum likelihood,implicit learning,bootstrap,response times,R-package,glba","PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING,RESPONSE-TIME,DIFFUSION,ACCURACY,IMPLICIT,DISTRIBUTIONS,RECOLLECTION,DISSOCIATION,MECHANISMS,KNOWLEDGE","Visser, Ingmar@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands::Poesse, Rens@Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Visser, Ingmar@University of Amsterdam::Poesse, Rens@University of Amsterdam",not exist,"The simplest complete model of choice response time: Linear ballistic accumulation+Brown, Scott D.; Heathcote, Andrew+COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 2008::A multinomial model to assess fluency and recollection in a sequence learning task+Buchner, A; Steffens, MC; Erdfelder, E; et al.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY SECTION A-HUMAN EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY+AUG 1997::LEARNING THE STRUCTURE OF EVENT SEQUENCES+CLEEREMANS, A; MCCLELLAND, JL+JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL+SEP 1991::Can sequence learning be implicit?

A heteroscedastic generalized linear model with a non-normal speed factor for responses and response times,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12087,MAY 2017,67,0,"In generalized linear modelling of responses and response times, the observed response time variables are commonly transformed to make their distribution approximately normal. A normal distribution for the transformed response times is desirable as it justifies the linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions in the underlying linear model. Past research has, however, shown that the transformed response times are not always normal. Models have been developed to accommodate this violation. In the present study, we propose a modelling approach for responses and response times to test and model non-normality in the transformed response times. Most importantly, we distinguish between non-normality due to heteroscedastic residual variances, and non-normality due to a skewed speed factor. In a simulation study, we establish parameter recovery and the power to separate both effects. In addition, we apply the model to a real data set.","response time modelling,non-normality,heteroscedasticity,item response theory,factor analysis,non-linearity","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL,DIFFERENTIAL SPEEDEDNESS,HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK,LATENT TRAIT,EM ALGORITHM,ACCURACY,TESTS,DISTRIBUTIONS,PARAMETERS","Molenaar, Dylan@Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands::Bolsinova, Maria@Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Molenaar, Dylan@University of Amsterdam::Bolsinova, Maria@University of Amsterdam",not exist,"Implicit bias and contact: The role of interethnic friendships+Aberson, CL; Shoemaker, C; Tomolillo, C+JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+JUN 2004::NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::ESTIMATING PARAMETERS OF LATENT POPULATION DISTRIBUTION+ANDERSEN, E; MADSEN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1977::Distance-based tests for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions+Anderson, MJ+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2006::Bayesian inference for a skew-normal IRT model under the centred parameterization+Azevedo, Caio L.

A comparison of item response models for accuracy and speed of item responses with applications to adaptive testing,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12101,MAY 2017,48,3,"We compare three modelling frameworks for accuracy and speed of item responses in the context of adaptive testing. The first framework is based on modelling scores that result from a scoring rule that incorporates both accuracy and speed. The second framework is the hierarchical modelling approach developed by van der Linden (2007, Psychometrika, 72, 287) in which a regular item response model is specified for accuracy and a log-normal model for speed. The third framework is the diffusion framework in which the response is assumed to be the result of a Wiener process. Although the three frameworks differ in the relation between accuracy and speed, one commonality is that the marginal model for accuracy can be simplified to the two-parameter logistic model. We discuss both conditional and marginal estimation of model parameters. Models from all three frameworks were fitted to data from a mathematics and spelling test. Furthermore, we applied a linear and adaptive testing mode to the data off-line in order to determine differences between modelling frameworks. It was found that a model from the scoring rule framework outperformed a hierarchical model in terms of model-based reliability, but the results were mixed with respect to correlations with external measures.","adaptive testing,conditional estimation,item response theory,response times,scoring rules","CONDITIONAL-INDEPENDENCE,HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK,TIME,RESIDUALS,INFERENCE","van Rijn, Peter W.@ETS Global, Strawinskylaan 929, NL-1077 Amsterdam, Netherlands::Ali, Usama S.@Educ Testing Serv, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA","van Rijn, Peter W.@Unknow::Ali, Usama S.@Educational Testing Service (ETS)",not exist,"CONDITIONAL INFERENCE FOR MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONNAIRES+ANDERSEN, EB+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1973::NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF A SET OF CONDITIONAL ESTIMATION EQUATIONS+ANDERSEN, EB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum,, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::A test for conditional independence between response time and accuracy+Bolsinova, Maria; Maris, Gunter+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 2016::Conditional Dependence between Response Time and Accuracy: An Overview of its Possible Sources and Directions for Distinguishing between Them+Bolsinova, Maria; Tijmstra, Jesper; Molenaar, Dylan; et al.+FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY+FEB 16 2017::Effects of differentially time-consuming tests on computer-adaptive test scores+Bridgeman, B; Cline, F+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SUM 2004::NONLINEAR SEQUENTIAL DESIGNS FOR LOGISTIC ITEM RESPONSE THEORY MODELS WITH APPLICATIONS TO COMPUTERIZED ADAPTIVE TESTS+Chang, Hua-Hua; Ying, Zhiliang+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2009::Distinguishing Fast and Slow Processes in Accuracy - Response Time Data+Coomans, Frederik; Hofman, Abe; Brinkhuis, Matthieu; et al.+PLOS ONE+MAY 11 2016::Spontaneous and imposed speed of cognitive test responses+De Boeck, P.; Chen, H.; Davison, M.+British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology+2017::no title+Fahrmeir, L.; Tutz, G.+Multivariate statistical modelling based on generalized linear models+2001::Utilizing Response Time Distributions for Item Selection in CAT+Fan, Zhewen; Wang, Chun; Chang, Hua-Hua; et al.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+OCT 2012::no title+Fischer, GH.+Einfuhrung in die Theorie Psychologischer Tests+1974::no title+Genz, Alan; Bretz, Frank; Hothorn, Torsten<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Miwa, Tetsuhisa; Mi, Xuefei; Leisch, Friedrich; Scheipl, Fabian</span>.+mvtnorm: Multivariate Normal and t Distributions .

Gaussian model-based partitioning using iterated local search,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12084,FEB 2017,85,0,"The emergence of Gaussian model-based partitioning as a viable alternative to K-means clustering fosters a need for discrete optimization methods that can be efficiently implemented using model-based criteria. A variety of alternative partitioning criteria have been proposed for more general data conditions that permit elliptical clusters, different spatial orientations for the clusters, and unequal cluster sizes. Unfortunately, many of these partitioning criteria are computationally demanding, which makes the multiple-restart (multistart) approach commonly used for K-means partitioning less effective as a heuristic solution strategy. As an alternative, we propose an approach based on iterated local search (ILS), which has proved effective in previous combinatorial data analysis contexts. We compared multistart, ILS and hybrid multistart-ILS procedures for minimizing a very general model-based criterion that assumes no restrictions on cluster size or within-group covariance structure. This comparison, which used 23 data sets from the classification literature, revealed that the ILS and hybrid heuristics generally provided better criterion function values than the multistart approach when all three methods were constrained to the same 10-min time limit. In many instances, these differences in criterion function values reflected profound differences in the partitions obtained.","clustering,model-based partitioning,heuristics","WITHIN-CLUSTER SUMS,COUPLED BINARY DATA,NEIGHBORHOOD SEARCH,SCHEDULING PROBLEM,EM ALGORITHM,DATA SET,SELECTION,CRITERIA,VARIABLES,NUMBER","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Shireman, Emilie@Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA::Steinley, Douglas@Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA::Brudvig, Susan@Indiana Univ East, Richmond, IN USA::Cradit, J.

Distance stability analysis in multidimensional scaling using the jackknife method,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12079,FEB 2017,27,0,"Stability or sensitivity analysis is an important topic in data analysis that has received little attention in the application of multidimensional scaling (MDS), for which the only available approaches are given in terms of a coordinate-based analytical jackknife methodology. Although in MDS the prime interest is in assessing the stability of the points in the configuration, this methodology may be influenced by imprecisions resulting from the inherently necessary Procrustes method. This paper proposes an analytical distance-based jackknife procedure to study stability and cross-validation in MDS in terms of the jackknife distances, which is not influenced by the Procrustes method. For each object, the corresponding jackknife estimated points are considered as naturally clustered points, and stability and cross-validation are analysed in terms of the MDS distances arising from the jackknife procedure, on the basis of a weighted cluster-MDS algorithm. A jackknife-relevant configuration is also proposed for cross-validation in terms of coordinates, in a cluster-MDS framework.","multidimensional scaling,jackknife,stability,analysis of dispersion,cross-validation,cluster difference scaling","SPATIAL CONSTRAINTS,PROCRUSTES ANALYSIS,DISSIMILARITY DATA,MODEL","Fernando Vera, Jose@Univ Granada, Dept Stat & OR, Fac Sci, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Fernando Vera, Jose@University of Granada",not exist,"Multidimensional scaling in the framework of cluster analysis+Bock, H.

Bayesian analysis of longitudinal multitrait-multimethod data with ordinal response variables,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12081,FEB 2017,93,0,"e A new multilevel latent state graded response model for longitudinal multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) measurement designs combining structurally different and interchangeable methods is proposed. The model allows researchers to examine construct validity over time and to study the change and stability of constructs and method effects based on ordinal response variables. We show how Bayesian estimation techniques can address a number of important issues that typically arise in longitudinal multilevel MTMM studies and facilitates the estimation of the model presented. Estimation accuracy and the impact of between- and within-level sample sizes as well as different prior specifications on parameter recovery were investigated in a Monte Carlo simulation study. Findings indicate that thparameters of the model presented can be accurately estimated with Bayesian estimation methods in the case of low convergent validity with as few as 250 clusters and more than two observations within each cluster. The model was applied to well-being data from a longitudinal MTMM study, assessing the change and stability of life satisfaction and subjective happiness in young adults after high-school graduation. Guidelines for empirical applications are provided and advantages and limitations of a Bayesian approach to estimating longitudinal multilevel MTMM models are discussed.","multitrait-multimethod measurement,multilevel item response theory,Bayesian statistics,Monte Carlo simulation,subjective well-being","STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,PREDICTIVE P-VALUES,LIFE SCALE,INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES,SUBJECTIVE HAPPINESS,CT-C(M-1) MODEL,TRAIT MODELS,SATISFACTION,CONVERGENT,VALIDITY","Holtmann, Jana@Free Univ Berlin, Dept Educ & Psychol, Berlin, Germany::Koch, Tobias@Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Ctr Methods, Luneburg, Germany::Bohn, Johannes@Free Univ Berlin, Dept Educ & Psychol, Berlin, Germany::Eid, Michael@Free Univ Berlin, Dept Educ & Psychol, Berlin, Germany","Holtmann, Jana@Free University of Berlin::Koch, Tobias@Leuphana University Luneburg::Bohn, Johannes@Free University of Berlin::Eid, Michael@Free University of Berlin",not exist,"Appreciation: Individual differences in finding value and meaning as a unique predictor of subjective well-being+Adler, MG; Fagley, NS+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY+FEB 2005::no title+Asparouhov, T.; Muthen, B.+Bayesian analysis of latent variable models using Mplus, Version 4+2010::Computationally efficient estimation of multilevel high-dimensional latent variable models+Asparouhov, T; Muthen, B.+P 2007 JOINT STAT M+2007::MCMC estimation and some model-fit analysis of multidimensional IRT models+Beguin, AA; Glas, CAW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::The dark side of conscientiousness: Conscientious people experience greater drops in life satisfaction following unemployment+Boyce, Christopher J.; Wood, Alex M.; Brown, Gordon D.

Developing new online calibration methods for multidimensional computerized adaptive testing,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12083,FEB 2017,51,1,"Multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) has received increasing attention over the past few years in educational measurement. Like all other formats of CAT, item replenishment is an essential part of MCAT for its item bank maintenance and management, which governs retiring overexposed or obsolete items over time and replacing them with new ones. Moreover, calibration precision of the new items will directly affect the estimation accuracy of examinees' ability vectors. In unidimensional CAT (UCAT) and cognitive diagnostic CAT, online calibration techniques have been developed to effectively calibrate new items. However, there has been very little discussion of online calibration in MCAT in the literature. Thus, this paper proposes new online calibration methods for MCAT based upon some popular methods used in UCAT. Three representative methods, Method A, the one EM cycle' method and the multiple EM cycles' method, are generalized to MCAT. Three simulation studies were conducted to compare the three new methods by manipulating three factors (test length, item bank design, and level of correlation between coordinate dimensions). The results showed that all the new methods were able to recover the item parameters accurately, and the adaptive online calibration designs showed some improvements compared to the random design under most conditions.","multidimensional computerized adaptive testing,item bank construction,item replenishment,online calibration,multidimensional two-parameter logistic model","ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,KULLBACK-LEIBLER INFORMATION,STOPPING RULES,MODELS,ABILITY,SELECTION,CAT,CONSTRAINTS,EXPOSURE,DESIGN","Chen, Ping@Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China::Wang, Chun@Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA::Xin, Tao@Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China::Chang, Hua-Hua@Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA","Chen, Ping@Beijing Normal University::Wang, Chun@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System::Xin, Tao@Beijing Normal University::Chang, Hua-Hua@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Chen, Ping@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2920-4205","Graphical representation of multidimensional item response theory analyses+Ackerman, T+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 1996::The multidimensional random coefficients multinomial logit model+Adams, RJ; Wilson, M; Wang, WC+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 1997::no title+no author+Item response theory: Parameter estimation techniques+2004::A comparative study of on-line pretest item - Calibration/scaling methods in computerized adaptive testing+Ban, JC; Hanson, BA; Wang, TY; et al.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+FAL 2001::MCMC estimation and some model-fit analysis of multidimensional IRT models+Beguin, AA; Glas, CAW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::Estimation of compensatory and noncompensatory multidimensional item response models using Markov chain Monte Carlo+Bolt, DM; Lall, VF+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+NOV 2003::ONLINE CALIBRATION VIA VARIABLE LENGTH COMPUTERIZED ADAPTIVE TESTING+Chang, Yuan-chin Ivan; Lu, Hung-Yi+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2010::A New Online Calibration Method for Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing+Chen, Ping; Wang, Chun+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 2016::ONLINE CALIBRATION METHODS FOR THE DINA MODEL WITH INDEPENDENT ATTRIBUTES IN CD-CAT+Chen, Ping; Xin, Tao; Wang, Chun; et al.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+APR 2012::THE IMPACT OF FALLIBLE ITEM PARAMETER ESTIMATES ON LATENT TRAIT RECOVERY+Cheng, Ying; Yuan, Ke-Hai+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2010::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::A GENERAL LATENT TRAIT MODEL FOR RESPONSE PROCESSES+EMBRETSON, S+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1984::Online calibration and scale stability of a CAT program+Guo, F.

Meta-CART: A tool to identify interactions between moderators in meta-analysis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12088,FEB 2017,25,2,"In the framework of meta-analysis, moderator analysis is usually performed only univariately. When several study characteristics are available that may account for treatment effect, standard meta-regression has difficulties in identifying interactions between them. To overcome this problem, meta-CART has been proposed: an approach that applies classification and regression trees (CART) to identify interactions, and then subgroup meta-analysis to test the significance of moderator effects. The previous version of meta-CART has its shortcomings: when applying CART, the sample sizes of studies are not taken into account, and the effect sizes are dichotomized around the median value. Therefore, this article proposes new meta-CART extensions, weighting study effect sizes by their accuracy, and using a regression tree to avoid dichotomization. In addition, new pruning rules are proposed. The performance of all versions of meta-CART was evaluated via a Monte Carlo simulation study. The simulation results revealed that meta-regression trees with random-effects weights and a 0.5-standard-error pruning rule perform best. The required sample size for meta-CART to achieve satisfactory performance depends on the number of study characteristics, the magnitude of the interactions, and the residual heterogeneity.","meta-analysis,classification and regression trees,interaction between moderators,weighted effect sizes,residual heterogeneity","PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS,HETEROGENEITY,REGRESSION,VARIABLES,SPLITS","Li, Xinru@Leiden Univ, Math Inst, POB 9512, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands::Dusseldorp, Elise@Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, Leiden, Netherlands::Meulman, Jacqueline J.@Leiden Univ, Math Inst, POB 9512, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Li, Xinru@Leiden University::Dusseldorp, Elise@Leiden University::Meulman, Jacqueline J.@Leiden University",not exist,"no title+Borenstein, M.; Hedges, L.

A tutorial on how to do a Mokken scale analysis on your test and questionnaire data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12078,FEB 2017,52,3,"Over the past decade, Mokken scale analysis (MSA) has rapidly grown in popularity among researchers from many different research areas. This tutorial provides researchers with a set of techniques and a procedure for their application, such that the construction of scales that have superior measurement properties is further optimized, taking full advantage of the properties of MSA. First, we define the conceptual context of MSA, discuss the two item response theory (IRT) models that constitute the basis of MSA, and discuss how these models differ from other IRT models. Second, we discuss dos and don'ts for MSA; the don'ts include misunderstandings we have frequently encountered with researchers in our three decades of experience with real-data MSA. Third, we discuss a methodology for MSA on real data that consist of a sample of persons who have provided scores on a set of items that, depending on the composition of the item set, constitute the basis for one or more scales, and we use the methodology to analyse an example real-data set.","automated item selection procedure,item ordering,Mokken scale analysis,non-parametric item response theory,ordinal scaling,person ordering,scalability coefficients","LATENT VARIABLE MODELS,POLYTOMOUS IRT MODELS,ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY,SOCIAL INHIBITION,D PERSONALITY,UNIDIMENSIONALITY,IMPUTATION,SCORES,TRAIT","Sijtsma, Klaas@Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands::van der Ark, L.

Response style analysis with threshold and multi-process IRT models: A review and tutorial,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12086,FEB 2017,42,4,"Two different item response theory model frameworks have been proposed for the assessment and control of response styles in rating data. According to one framework, response styles can be assessed by analysing threshold parameters in Rasch models for ordinal data and in mixture-distribution extensions of such models. A different framework is provided by multi-process item response tree models, which can be used to disentangle response processes that are related to the substantive traits and response tendencies elicited by the response scale. In this tutorial, the two approaches are reviewed, illustrated with an empirical data set of the two-dimensional Personal Need for Structure' construct, and compared in terms of multiple criteria. Mplus is used as a software framework for (mixed) polytomous Rasch models and item response tree models as well as for demonstrating how parsimonious model variants can be specified to test assumptions on the structure of response styles and attitude strength. Although both frameworks are shown to account for response styles, they differ on the quantitative criteria of model selection, practical aspects of model estimation, and conceptual issues of representing response styles as continuous and multidimensional sources of individual differences in psychological assessment.","response style,threshold item-response models,item-response tree models,MPLUS,attitudinal measurement","INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES,PERSONAL NEED,MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE,VALIDITY,SCALE","Bockenholt, Ulf@Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA::Meiser, Thorsten@Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany","Bockenholt, Ulf@Northwestern University::Meiser, Thorsten@University of Mannheim",not exist,"RATING FORMULATION FOR ORDERED RESPONSE CATEGORIES+ANDRICH, D+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1978::Understanding the Response Structure and Process in the Polytomous Rasch Model+Andrich, David+HANDBOOK OF POLYTOMOUS ITEM RESPONSE THEORY MODELS+2010::Individual differences in response scale use: Mixed Rasch modelling of responses to NEO-FFI items+Austin, EJ; Deary, IJ; Egan, V+PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES+APR 2006::Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4+Bates, Douglas; Maechler, Martin; Bolker, Benjamin M.; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+OCT 2015::Response styles in marketing research: A cross-national investigation+Baumgartner, H; Steenkamp, JBEM+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+MAY 2001::Modeling Multiple Response Processes in Judgment and Choice+Boeckenholt, Ulf+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2012::Addressing Score Bias and Differential Item Functioning Due to Individual Differences in Response Style+Bolt, Daniel M.; Johnson, Timothy R.+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUL 2009::Multiscale Measurement of Extreme Response Style+Bolt, Daniel M.; Newton, Joseph R.+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+OCT 2011::IRTrees: Tree-Based Item Response Models of the GLMM Family+De Boeck, Paul; Partchev, Ivailo+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+MAY 2012::Detecting measurement invariance in organizational surveys+Eid, M; Rauber, M+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT+2000::Response styles in the assessment of anger expression+Gollwitzer, M; Eid, M; Jurgensen, R+PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT+MAR 2005::The Partial Credit Model and Generalized Partial Credit Model as Constrained Nominal Response Models, With Applications in Mplus+Huggins-Manley, Anne Corinne; Algina, James+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+APR 3 2015::Generalized IRT Models for Extreme Response Style+Jin, Kuan-Yu; Wang, Wen-Chung+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+FEB 2014::On the Use of Factor-Analytic Multinomial Logit Item Response Models to Account for Individual Differences in Response Style+Johnson, Timothy R.; Bolt, Daniel M.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+FEB 2010::Measuring Response Styles Across the Big Five: A Multiscale Extension of an Approach Using Multinomial Processing Trees+Khorramdel, Lale; von Davier, Matthias+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+MAR 1 2014::no title+Kiefer, T.; Robitzsch, A.; Wu, M.+Package 'TAM': Test analysis modules (version 1.16-0)+2016::Psychological theory testing versus psychometric nay-saying: Comment+Kruglanski, AW; Atash, MN; DeGrada, E; et al.+JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 1997::Personal need for structure as a construct of dispositional differences in social psychology: Psychometric analysis and validation of a German PNS scale+Machunsky, M; Meiser, T+ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALPSYCHOLOGIE+JUN 2006::A RASCH MODEL FOR PARTIAL CREDIT SCORING+MASTERS, GN+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1982::IRT-Analyse von Traitauspragung und Antwortstilen in Ratingdaten [IRT analysis of trait degree and response styles in rating data]+Meiser, T.; Bockenholt, U.+Paper presented at the Fachgruppentagung Methoden &amp; Evaluation [Conference on Methods &amp; Evaluation]+2011::The personal structure of personal need for structure - A mixture-distribution Rasch analysis+Meiser, Thorsten; Machunsky, Maya+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT+2008::no title+Millsap, R.

Comparing dependent robust correlations,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12069,NOV 2016,24,4,"Let r(1) and r(2) be two dependent estimates of Pearson's correlation. There is a substantial literature on testing H-0:(1)=(2), the hypothesis that the population correlation coefficients are equal. However, it is well known that Pearson's correlation is not robust. Even a single outlier can have a substantial impact on Pearson's correlation, resulting in a misleading understanding about the strength of the association among the bulk of the points. A way of mitigating this concern is to use a correlation coefficient that guards against outliers, many of which have been proposed. But apparently there are no results on how to compare dependent robust correlation coefficients when there is heteroscedasicity. Extant results suggest that a basic percentile bootstrap will perform reasonably well. This paper reports simulation results indicating the extent to which this is true when using Spearman's rho, a Winsorized correlation or a skipped correlation.","Measures of association,level robust methods,heteroscedasticity,Spearman's rho,Winsorized correlation,skipped correlation","CORRELATION-COEFFICIENTS,TESTS","Wilcox, Rand R.@Univ Southern Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Wilcox, Rand R.@University of Southern California",not exist,"ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::A COMPARISON OF FACTOR ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES+BROWNE, MW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1968::Effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention in promoting the well-being of independently living older people: results of the Well Elderly 2 Randomised Controlled Trial.

Limited-information goodness-of-fit testing of diagnostic classification item response models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12074,NOV 2016,45,5,"Despite the growing popularity of diagnostic classification models (e.g., Rupp etal., 2010, Diagnostic measurement: theory, methods, and applications, Guilford Press, New York, NY) in educational and psychological measurement, methods for testing their absolute goodness of fit to real data remain relatively underdeveloped. For tests of reasonable length and for realistic sample size, full-information test statistics such as Pearson's X-2 and the likelihood ratio statistic G(2) suffer from sparseness in the underlying contingency table from which they are computed. Recently, limited-information fit statistics such as Maydeu-Olivares and Joe's (2006, Psychometrika, 71, 713) M-2 have been found to be quite useful in testing the overall goodness of fit of item response theory models. In this study, we applied Maydeu-Olivares and Joe's (2006, Psychometrika, 71, 713) M-2 statistic to diagnostic classification models. Through a series of simulation studies, we found that M-2 is well calibrated across a wide range of diagnostic model structures and was sensitive to certain misspecifications of the item model (e.g., fitting disjunctive models to data generated according to a conjunctive model), errors in the Q-matrix (adding or omitting paths, omitting a latent variable), and violations of local item independence due to unmodelled testlet effects. On the other hand, M-2 was largely insensitive to misspecifications in the distribution of higher-order latent dimensions and to the specification of an extraneous attribute. To complement the analyses of the overall model goodness of fit using M-2, we investigated the utility of the Chen and Thissen (1997, J. Educ. Behav. Stat., 22, 265) local dependence statistic XLD2 for characterizing sources of misfit, an important aspect of model appraisal often overlooked in favour of overall statements. The XLD2 statistic was found to be slightly conservative (with Type I error rates consistently below the nominal level) but still useful in pinpointing the sources of misfit.

A sequential cognitive diagnosis model for polytomous responses,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12070,NOV 2016,35,6,"This paper proposes a general polytomous cognitive diagnosis model for a special type of graded responses, where item categories are attained in a sequential manner, and associated with some attributes explicitly. To relate categories to attributes, a category-level Q-matrix is used. When the attribute and category association is specified a priori, the proposed model has the flexibility to allow different cognitive processes (e.g., conjunctive, disjunctive) to be modelled at different categories within a single item. This model can be extended for items where categories cannot be explicitly linked to attributes, and for items with unordered categories. The feasibility of the proposed model is examined using simulated data. The proposed model is illustrated using the data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2007 assessment.","cognitive diagnosis,generalized DINA,polytomous response,sequential process model,processing function,sequential G-DINA model,Q-matrix","LATENT CLASS MODELS,DINA MODEL,ITEM PARAMETERS,Q-MATRIX,CLASSIFICATION,ACHIEVEMENT","Ma, Wenchao@Rutgers State Univ, 10 Seminary Pl, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA::de la Torre, Jimmy@Rutgers State Univ, 10 Seminary Pl, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Ma, Wenchao@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::de la Torre, Jimmy@Rutgers State University New Brunswick","Ma, Wenchao@P-5443-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6763-0707","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::EFFECTS OF RESPONSE FORMAT ON DIAGNOSTIC-ASSESSMENT OF SCHOLASTIC ACHIEVEMENT+BIRENBAUM, M; TATSUOKA, KK; GUTVIRTZ, Y+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 1992::OPEN-ENDED VERSUS MULTIPLE-CHOICE RESPONSE FORMATS - IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES+BIRENBAUM, M; TATSUOKA, KK+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 1987::MARGINAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF ITEM PARAMETERS - APPLICATION OF AN EM ALGORITHM+BOCK, RD; AITKIN, M+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1981::ESTIMATING ITEM PARAMETERS AND LATENT ABILITY WHEN RESPONSES ARE SCORED IN 2 OR MORE NOMINAL CATEGORIES+BOCK, RD+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1972::no title+Carlin, BP; Louis, TA.+Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis+2000::Cluster Analysis for Cognitive Diagnosis: Theory and Applications+Chiu, Chia-Yi; Douglas, Jeffrey A.; Li, Xiaodong+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2009::The partial-credit DINA Model+de la Torre, J.+INT M PSYCH SOC ATH+2010::Evaluating the Wald Test for Item-Level Comparison of Saturated and Reduced Models in Cognitive Diagnosis+de la Torre, Jimmy; Lee, Young-Sun+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 2013::An Empirically Based Method of Q-Matrix Validation for the DINA Model: Development and Applications+de la Torre, Jimmy+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+WIN 2008::The Generalized DINA Model Framework+de la Torre, Jimmy+PSYCHOMETRIKA+APR 2011::On the Analysis of Fraction Subtraction Data: The DINA Model, Classification, Latent Class Sizes, and the Q-Matrix+DeCarlo, Lawrence T.+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JAN 2011::Review of Cognitively Diagnostic Assessment and a Summary of Psychometric Models+DiBello, Louis V.; Roussos, Louis A.; Stout, William+PSYCHOMETRICS+2007::Model evaluation and multiple strategies in cognitive diagnosis analysis of fraction subtraction data+Douglas, J.

Properties of bootstrap tests for N-of-1 studies,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12071,NOV 2016,14,2,"N-of-1 study designs involve the collection and analysis of repeated measures data from an individual not using an intervention and using an intervention. This study explores the use of semi-parametric and parametric bootstrap tests in the analysis of N-of-1 studies under a single time series framework in the presence of autocorrelation. When the Type I error rates of bootstrap tests are compared to Wald tests, our results show that the bootstrap tests have more desirable properties. We compare the results for normally distributed errors with those for contaminated normally distributed errors and find that, except when there is relatively large autocorrelation, there is little difference between the power of the parametric and semi-parametric bootstrap tests. We also experiment with two intervention designs: ABAB and AB, and show the ABAB design has more power. The results provide guidelines for designing N-of-1 studies, in the sense of how many observations and how many intervention changes are needed to achieve a certain level of power and which test should be performed.","N-of-1 studies,power,semi- and parametric bootstrapping,Wald test,Type I error rate",MODELS,"Lin, Sharon X.@Univ Southampton, S3RI, Highfield Campus,Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England@Univ Southampton, Natl Inst Hlth Res NIHR, Wessex Collaborat Leadership & Res Hlth Care CLAH, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England::Morrison, Leanne@Univ Southampton, Acad Unit Psychol, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England::Smith, Peter W.

On initial item selection in cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12072,NOV 2016,30,0,"There has recently been much interest in computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for cognitive diagnosis. While there exist various item selection criteria and different asymptotically optimal designs, these are mostly constructed based on the asymptotic theory assuming the test length goes to infinity. In practice, with limited test lengths, the desired asymptotic optimality may not always apply, and there are few studies in the literature concerning the optimal design of finite items. Related questions, such as how many items we need in order to be able to identify the attribute pattern of an examinee and what types of initial items provide the optimal classification results, are still open. This paper aims to answer these questions by providing non-asymptotic theory of the optimal selection of initial items in cognitive diagnostic CAT. In particular, for the optimal design, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the Q-matrix structure of the initial items. The theoretical development is suitable for a general family of cognitive diagnostic models. The results not only provide a guideline for the design of optimal item selection procedures, but also may be applied to guide item bank construction.","optimal item selection,Q-matrix,computerized adaptive testing,cognitive diagnosis",,"Xu, Gongjun@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, 313 Ford Hall,224 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Wang, Chun@Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN USA::Shang, Zhuoran@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, 313 Ford Hall,224 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Xu, Gongjun@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System::Wang, Chun@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System::Shang, Zhuoran@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System",not exist,"A global information approach to computerized adoptive testing+Chang, HH; Ying, ZL+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 1996::Statistical Analysis of Q-Matrix Based Diagnostic Classification Models+Chen, Yunxiao; Liu, Jingchen; Xu, Gongjun; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2015::When Cognitive Diagnosis Meets Computerized Adaptive Testing: CD-CAT+Cheng, Ying+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2009::Cluster Analysis for Cognitive Diagnosis: Theory and Applications+Chiu, Chia-Yi; Douglas, Jeffrey A.; Li, Xiaodong+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2009::Higher-order latent trait models for cognitive diagnosis+De la Torre, J; Douglas, JA+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 2004::The Generalized DINA Model Framework+de la Torre, Jimmy+PSYCHOMETRIKA+APR 2011::Unified cognitive/psychometric diagnostic assessment likelihood-based classification techniques+DiBello, L.

"The relationship between multilevel models and non-parametric multilevel mixture models: Discrete approximation of intraclass correlation, random coefficient distributions, and residual heteroscedasticity",BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12073,NOV 2016,53,3,"Multilevel data structures are common in the social sciences. Often, such nested data are analysed with multilevel models (MLMs) in which heterogeneity between clusters is modelled by continuously distributed random intercepts and/or slopes. Alternatively, the non-parametric multilevel regression mixture model (NPMM) can accommodate the same nested data structures through discrete latent class variation. The purpose of this article is to delineate analytic relationships between NPMM and MLM parameters that are useful for understanding the indirect interpretation of the NPMM as a non-parametric approximation of the MLM, with relaxed distributional assumptions. We define how seven standard and non-standard MLM specifications can be indirectly approximated by particular NPMM specifications. We provide formulas showing how the NPMM can serve as an approximation of the MLM in terms of intraclass correlation, random coefficient means and (co)variances, heteroscedasticity of residuals at level 1, and heteroscedasticity of residuals at level 2. Further, we discuss how these relationships can be useful in practice. The specific relationships are illustrated with simulated graphical demonstrations, and direct and indirect interpretations of NPMM classes are contrasted. We provide an R function to aid in implementing and visualizing an indirect interpretation of NPMM classes. An empirical example is presented and future directions are discussed.","multilevel modeling,mixture modeling,multilevel mixture modeling,hierarchical linear modeling,mixed-effects modeling,nonparametric mixture,semiparametric mixture","LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS,SEMIPARAMETRIC APPROACH,NONLINEAR RELATIONS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,DATA SETS,REGRESSION,VARIABLES,CONSTRAINTS,PARAMETERS,BOUNDARY","Rights, Jason D.@Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA::Sterba, Sonya K.@Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Rights, Jason D.@Vanderbilt University::Sterba, Sonya K.@Vanderbilt University",not exist,"Multilevel mixture models+Asparouhov, Tihomir; Muthen, Bengt+ADVANCES IN LATENT VARIABLE MIXTURE MODELS+2008::Observations on the use of growth mixture models in psychological research+Bauer, Daniel J.+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+2007::Distributional assumptions of growth mixture models: Implications for overextraction of latent trajectory classes+Bauer, DJ; Curran, PJ+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2003::A semiparametric approach to modeling nonlinear relations among latent variables+Bauer, DJ+STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL+2005::Challenges for person-oriented research: Some considerations based on Laursen's article 'I Don't Quite Get it...: Personal Experiences with the Person-Oriented Approach'+Bergman, L.

A short note on the maximal point-biserial correlation under non-normality,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12075,NOV 2016,21,0,"The aim of this paper is to derive the maximal point-biserial correlation under non-normality. Several widely used non-normal distributions are considered, namely the uniform distribution, t-distribution, exponential distribution, and a mixture of two normal distributions. Results show that the maximal point-biserial correlation, depending on the non-normal continuous variable underlying the binary manifest variable, may not be a function of p (the probability that the dichotomous variable takes the value 1), can be symmetric or non-symmetric around p=.5, and may still lie in the range from -1.0 to 1.0. Therefore researchers should exercise caution when they interpret their sample point-biserial correlation coefficients based on popular beliefs that the maximal point-biserial correlation is always smaller than 1, and that the size of the correlation is always further restricted as p deviates from .5.","point-biserial correlation,maximal point-biserial correlation,non-normality",,"Cheng, Ying@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, 118 Haggar Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA::Liu, Haiyan@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, 118 Haggar Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Cheng, Ying@University of Notre Dame::Liu, Haiyan@University of Notre Dame",not exist,"no title+Allen, M.

Assessing moderated mediation in linear models requires fewer confounding assumptions than assessing mediation,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12077,NOV 2016,43,1,"It is well known from the mediation analysis literature that the identification of direct and indirect effects relies on strong no unmeasured confounding assumptions of no unmeasured confounding. Even in randomized studies the mediator may still be correlated with unobserved prognostic variables that affect the outcome, in which case the mediator's role in the causal process may not be inferred without bias. In the behavioural and social science literature very little attention has been given so far to the causal assumptions required for moderated mediation analysis. In this paper we focus on the index for moderated mediation, which measures by how much the mediated effect is larger or smaller for varying levels of the moderator. We show that in linear models this index can be estimated without bias in the presence of unmeasured common causes of the moderator, mediator and outcome under certain conditions. Importantly, one can thus use the test for moderated mediation to support evidence for mediation under less stringent confounding conditions. We illustrate our findings with data from a randomized experiment assessing the impact of being primed with social deception upon observer responses to others' pain, and from an observational study of individuals who ended a romantic relationship assessing the effect of attachment anxiety during the relationship on mental distress 2years after the break-up.","confounding,mediation,moderation,moderated mediation","CAUSAL,DECOMPOSITION,TESTS","Loeys, Tom@Univ Ghent, Dept Data Anal, Henri Dunantlaan 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium::Talloen, Wouter@Univ Ghent, Dept Data Anal, Henri Dunantlaan 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium::Goubert, Liesbet@Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium::Moerkerke, Beatrijs@Univ Ghent, Dept Data Anal, Henri Dunantlaan 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium::Vansteelandt, Stijn@Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Loeys, Tom@Ghent University::Talloen, Wouter@Ghent University::Goubert, Liesbet@Ghent University::Moerkerke, Beatrijs@Ghent University::Vansteelandt, Stijn@Ghent University","Vansteelandt, Stijn@J-4072-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4207-8733","no title+Aiken, L.

Modelling non-normal data: The relationship between the skew-normal factor model and the quadratic factor model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12062,MAY 2016,31,2,"Maximum likelihood estimation of the linear factor model for continuous items assumes normally distributed item scores. We consider deviations from normality by means of a skew-normally distributed factor model or a quadratic factor model. We show that the item distributions under a skew-normal factor are equivalent to those under a quadratic model up to third-order moments. The reverse only holds if the quadratic loadings are equal to each other and within certain bounds. We illustrate that observed data which follow any skew-normal factor model can be so well approximated with the quadratic factor model that the models are empirically indistinguishable, and that the reverse does not hold in general. The choice between the two models to account for deviations of normality is illustrated by an empirical example from clinical psychology.","non-normality,skew-normal factor model,nonlinear factor model,skew-normal distribution","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,LATENT VARIABLE MODELS,ESTIMATORS,TESTS","Smits, Iris A.

Limited information estimation of the diffusion-based item response theory model for responses and response times,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12064,MAY 2016,27,1,"Psychological tests are usually analysed with item response models. Recently, some alternative measurement models have been proposed that were derived from cognitive process models developed in experimental psychology. These models consider the responses but also the response times of the test takers. Two such models are the Q-diffusion model and the D-diffusion model. Both models can be calibrated with the diffIRT package of the R statistical environment via marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimation. In this manuscript, an alternative approach to model calibration is proposed. The approach is based on weighted least squares estimation and parallels the standard estimation approach in structural equationmodelling. Estimates are determined by minimizing the discrepancy between the observed and the implied covariance matrix. The estimator is simple to implement, consistent, and asymptotically normally distributed. Least squares estimation also provides a test of model fit by comparing the observed and implied covariance matrix. The estimator and the test of model fit are evaluated in a simulation study. Although parameter recovery is good, the estimator is less efficient than the MML estimator.","diffusion model,item response theory,weighted least squares","STRUCTURAL MODELS,ACCURACY,TESTS,RACE","Ranger, Jochen@Univ Halle Wittenberg, D-06108 Halle, Germany::Kuhn, Joerg-Tobias@Univ Munster, Munster, Germany::Szardenings, Carsten@Univ Munster, Munster, Germany","Ranger, Jochen@Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg::Kuhn, Joerg-Tobias@University of Munster::Szardenings, Carsten@University of Munster","Szardenings, Carsten@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1650-2705","ASYMPTOTICALLY DISTRIBUTION-FREE METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES+BROWNE, MW+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1984::Even faster and even more accurate first-passage time densities and distributions for the Wiener diffusion model+Godan, M.; Blurton, S.; Kesselmeier, M.+Journal of Mathematical Psychology+2014::Limited information estimation and testing of discretized multivariate normal structural models+Maydeu-Olivares, A+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2006::Fitting Diffusion Item Response Theory Models for Responses and Response Times Using the R Package diffIRT+Molenaar, Dylan; Tuerlinckx, Francis; van der Maas, Han L.

Sequential detection of learning in cognitive diagnosis,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12065,MAY 2016,57,2,"In order to look more closely at the many particular skills examinees utilize to answer items, cognitive diagnosis models have received much attention, and perhaps are preferable to item response models that ordinarily involve just one or a few broadly defined skills, when the objective is to hasten learning. If these fine-grained skills can be identified, a sharpened focus on learning and remediation can be achieved. The focus here is on how to detect when learning has taken place for a particular attribute and efficiently guide a student through a sequence of items to ultimately attain mastery of all attributes while administering as few items as possible. This can be seen as a problem in sequential change-point detection for which there is a long history and a well-developed literature. Though some ad hoc rules for determining learning may be used, such as stopping after M consecutive items have been successfully answered, more efficient methods that are optimal under various conditions are available. The CUSUM, Shiryaev-Roberts and Shiryaev procedures can dramatically reduce the time required to detect learning while maintaining rigorous Type I error control, and they are studied in this context through simulation. Future directions for modelling and detection of learning are discussed.","cognitive diagnosis,learning,sequential analysis,change detection","INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS,KULLBACK-LEIBLER DIVERGENCE,HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS,TIME-SERIES,PERSON FIT,METAANALYSIS,SCORES,PERFORMANCE,STATISTICS,FEEDBACK","Ye, Sangbeak@Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA::Fellouris, Georgios@Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA::Culpepper, Steven@Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA::Douglas, Jeff@Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Ye, Sangbeak@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign::Fellouris, Georgios@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign::Culpepper, Steven@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign::Douglas, Jeff@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign",not exist,"Automated, Unobtrusive, Action-by-Action Assessment of Self-Regulation During Learning With an Intelligent Tutoring System+Aleven, Vincent; Roll, Ido; McLaren, Bruce M.; et al.+EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST+2010::COGNITIVE MODELING AND INTELLIGENT TUTORING+ANDERSON, JR; BOYLE, CF; CORBETT, AT; et al.+ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE+FEB 1990::Cognitive tutors: Lessons learned+Anderson, JR; Corbett, AT; Koedinger, KR; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES+1995::A Parametric Cumulative Sum Statistic for Person Fit+Armstrong, Ronald D.; Shi, Min+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUL 2009::Model-Free CUSUM Methods for Person Fit+Armstrong, Ronald D.; Shi, Min+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+WIN 2009::THE INFLUENCE OF THE EVALUATING INSTRUMENT ON STUDENTS LEARNING+BALCH, J+AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL+1964::Automatic Detection of Answer Copying via Kullback-Leibler Divergence and K-Index+Belov, Dmitry I.; Armstrong, Ronald D.+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SEP 2010::Detection of Test Collusion via Kullback-Leibler Divergence+Belov, Dmitry I.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SUM 2013::The Generalized DINA Model Framework+de la Torre, Jimmy+PSYCHOMETRIKA+APR 2011::Detection of aberrant item score patterns in computerized adaptive testing: An empirical example using the CUSUM+Egberink, Iris J.

Testing for negligible interaction: A coherent and robust approach,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12066,MAY 2016,26,1,"Researchers often want to demonstrate a lack of interaction between two categorical predictors on an outcome. To justify a lack of interaction, researchers typically accept the null hypothesis of no interaction from a conventional analysis of variance (ANOVA). This method is inappropriate as failure to reject the null hypothesis does not provide statistical evidence to support a lack of interaction. This study proposes a bootstrap-based intersection-union test for negligible interaction that provides coherent decisions between the omnibus test and post hoc interaction contrast tests and is robust to violations of the normality and variance homogeneity assumptions. Further, a multiple comparison strategy for testing interaction contrasts following a non-significant omnibus test is proposed. Our simulation study compared the Type I error control, omnibus power and per-contrast power of the proposed approach to the non-centrality-based negligible interaction test of Cheng and Shao (2007, Statistica Sinica, 17, 1441). For 2x2 designs, the empirical Type I error rates of the Cheng and Shao test were very close to the nominal level when the normality and variance homogeneity assumptions were satisfied; however, only our proposed bootstrapping approach was satisfactory under non-normality and/or variance heterogeneity. In general axb designs, although the omnibus Cheng and Shao test, as expected, is the most powerful, it is not robust to assumption violation and results in incoherent omnibus and interaction contrast decisions that are not possible with the intersection-union approach.","equivalence testing,negligible interaction,lack of interaction,factorial ANOVA","ONE-SIDED TESTS,EQUIVALENCE,MULTIPLICITY,PSYCHOLOGY,STATISTICS,DESIGNS,TRIALS","Cribbie, Robert A.@York Univ, Dept Psychol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada::Ragoonanan, Chantal@York Univ, Dept Psychol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada::Counsell, Alyssa@York Univ, Dept Psychol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","Cribbie, Robert A.@York University - Canada::Ragoonanan, Chantal@York University - Canada::Counsell, Alyssa@York University - Canada",not exist,"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence - We need to report uncertain results and do it clearly+Alderson, P+BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+FEB 28 2004::MULTI-PARAMETER HYPOTHESIS-TESTING AND ACCEPTANCE SAMPLING+BERGER, RL+TECHNOMETRICS+1982::ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::Easy Multiplicity Control in Equivalence Testing Using Two One-Sided Tests (vol 63, pg 147, 2009)+Caffo, Brian; Lauzon, Carolyn; Roehmel, Joachim+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2013::Exact tests for negligible interaction in two-way analysis of variance/covariance+Cheng, Bin; Shao, Jun+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2007::no title+Cohen, J.+Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences+1988::Recommendations for applying tests of equivalence+Cribbie, RA; Gruman, JA; Arpin-Cribbie, CA+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY+JAN 2004::Effect of non-normality on test statistics for one-way independent groups designs+Cribbie, Robert A.; Fiksenbaum, Lisa; Keselman, H.

The choice of the ability estimate with asymptotically correct standardized person-fit statistics,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12067,MAY 2016,34,5,"Snijders (2001, Psychometrika, 66, 331) suggested a statistical adjustment to obtain the asymptotically correct standardized versions of a specific class of person-fit statistics. His adjustment has been used to obtain the asymptotically correct standardized versions of several person-fit statistics including the lz statistic (Drasgow etal., 1985, Br. J. Math. Stat. Psychol., 38, 67), the infit and outfit statistics (e.g., Wright & Masters, 1982, Rating scale analysis, Chicago, IL: Mesa Press), and the standardized extended caution indices (Tatsuoka, 1984, Psychometrika, 49, 95). Snijders (2001), van Krimpen-Stoop and Meijer (1999, Appl. Psychol. Meas., 23, 327), Magis etal. (2012, J. Educ. Behav. Stat., 37, 57), Magis etal. (2014, J. Appl. Meas., 15, 82), and Sinharay (2015b, Psychometrika, doi:, 2016b, Corrections of standardized extended caution indices, Unpublished manuscript) have used the maximum likelihood estimate, the weighted likelihood estimate, and the posterior mode of the examinee ability with the adjustment of Snijders (2001). This paper broadens the applicability of the adjustment of Snijders (2001) by showing how other ability estimates such as the expected a posteriori estimate, the biweight estimate (Mislevy & Bock, 1982, Educ. Psychol. Meas., 42, 725), and the Huber estimate (Schuster & Yuan, 2011, J. Educ. Behav. Stat., 36, 720) can be used with the adjustment. A simulation study is performed to examine the Type I error rate and power of two asymptotically correct standardized person-fit statistics with several ability estimates.

An evaluation of exact methods for the multiple subset maximum cardinality selection problem,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12068,MAY 2016,33,0,"The maximum cardinality subset selection problem requires finding the largest possible subset from a set of objects, such that one or more conditions are satisfied. An important extension of this problem is to extract multiple subsets, where the addition of one more object to a larger subset would always be preferred to increases in the size of one or more smaller subsets. We refer to this as the multiple subset maximum cardinality selection problem (MSMCSP). A recently published branch-and-bound algorithm solves the MSMCSP as a partitioning problem. Unfortunately, the computational requirement associated with the algorithm is often enormous, thus rendering the method infeasible from a practical standpoint. In this paper, we present an alternative approach that successively solves a series of binary integer linear programs to obtain a globally optimal solution to the MSMCSP. Computational comparisons of the methods using published similarity data for 45 food items reveal that the proposed sequential method is computationally far more efficient than the branch-and-bound approach.","item selection,integer programming,branch-and-bound,similarity data,exploratory Mokken scale analysis","MOKKEN SCALE ANALYSIS,PROGRAMMING APPROACH,ITEM SELECTION,CONFUSION,MODELS,ALGORITHM,SERIATION,TESTS","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State Univ, Dept Mkt, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Koehn, Hans-Friedrich@Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA::Steinley, Douglas@Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State University@State University System of Florida::Koehn, Hans-Friedrich@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign::Steinley, Douglas@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"METHODS AND MODELS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF WEAKLY PARALLEL TESTS+ADEMA, JJ+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 1992::APPLICATIONS OF COMBINATORIAL PROGRAMMING TO DATA-ANALYSIS - SERIATION USING ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITY MEASURES+BAKER, FB; HUBERT, LJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1977::Uniform test assembly+Belov, Dmitry I.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2008::no title+BRUSCO, M.

We introduce a factor model for the J x J covariance matrices Sigma(k), k=1,..., K, where the common part is modelled by Parafac2 and the unique variances boolean OR(k), k=1,..., K, are diagonal. The Parafac2 model implies a common loadings matrix that is rescaled for each k, and a common factor correlation matrix. We estimate the unique variances boolean OR(k) by minimum rank factor analysis on Sigma(k) for each k. The factors can be chosen orthogonal or oblique. We present a novel algorithm to estimate the Parafac2 part and demonstrate its performance in a simulation study. Also, we fit our model to a data set in the literature. Our model is easy to estimate and interpret. The unique variances, the factor correlation matrix and the communalities are guaranteed to be proper, and a percentage of explained common variance can be computed for each k. Also, the Parafac2 part is rotationally unique under mild conditions.","multi-set data,factor analysis,Parafac,Parafac2,minimum rank factor analysis","3-MODE FACTOR-ANALYSIS,CANDECOMP/PARAFAC,MODELS,DECOMPOSITION,ALGORITHM,MATRIX,RANK","Stegeman, Alwin@Univ Groningen, Heymans Inst Psychol Res, Grote Kruisstr 2-1, NL-9712 TS Groningen, Netherlands::Lam, Tam T.

Asymptotic efficiency of the pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator in multi-group factor models with pooled data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12056,FEB 2016,26,3,"A multi-group factor model is suitable for data originating from different strata. However, it often requires a relatively large sample size to avoid numerical issues such as non-convergence and non-positive definite covariance matrices. An alternative is to pool data from different groups in which a single-group factor model is fitted to the pooled data using maximum likelihood. In this paper, properties of pseudo-maximum likelihood (PML) estimators for pooled data are studied. The pooled data are assumed to be normally distributed from a single group. The resulting asymptotic efficiency of the PML estimators of factor loadings is compared with that of the multi-group maximum likelihood estimators. The effect of pooling is investigated through a two-group factor model. The variances of factor loadings for the pooled data are underestimated under the normal theory when error variances in the smaller group are larger. Underestimation is due to dependence between the pooled factors and pooled error terms. Small-sample properties of the PML estimators are also investigated using a Monte Carlo study.","sandwich estimator,robustness,normal theory,measurement invariance","COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,FACTOR MIXTURE-MODELS,POPULATIONS,ROBUSTNESS,STATISTICS,VARIABLES,SAMPLES","Jin, Shaobo@Uppsala Univ, Dept Stat, Box 513,Kyrkogardsgatan 10, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden::Yang-Wallentin, Fan@Uppsala Univ, Dept Stat, Box 513,Kyrkogardsgatan 10, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden::Christoffersson, Anders@Uppsala Univ, Dept Stat, Box 513,Kyrkogardsgatan 10, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden","Jin, Shaobo@Uppsala University::Yang-Wallentin, Fan@Uppsala University::Christoffersson, Anders@Uppsala University",not exist,"THE ASYMPTOTIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF SOME ESTIMATORS FOR A FACTOR-ANALYSIS MODEL+AMEMIYA, Y; FULLER, WA; PANTULA, SG+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUN 1987::THE ASYMPTOTIC NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION OF ESTIMATORS IN FACTOR-ANALYSIS UNDER GENERAL CONDITIONS+ANDERSON, TW; AMEMIYA, Y+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1988::PSEUDO MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION AND A TEST FOR MISSPECIFICATION IN MEAN AND COVARIANCE STRUCTURE MODELS+ARMINGER, G; SCHOENBERG, RJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1989::Structural equation modeling with small samples: Test statistics+Bentler, PM; Yuan, KH+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+1999::SOME CONTRIBUTIONS TO EFFICIENT STATISTICS IN STRUCTURAL MODELS - SPECIFICATION AND ESTIMATION OF MOMENT STRUCTURES+BENTLER, PM+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1983::Covariance structures+Browne, M.W.+Tapies in Applied Multivariate Analysis+1982::ROBUSTNESS OF STATISTICAL-INFERENCE IN FACTOR-ANALYSIS AND RELATED MODELS+BROWNE, MW+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1987::ASYMPTOTICALLY DISTRIBUTION-FREE METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE-STRUCTURES+BROWNE, MW+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1984::GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATORS IN ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE STRUCTURES+BROWNE, MW+SOUTH AFRICAN STATISTICAL JOURNAL+1974::no title+Ferguson, T.+A Course in Large Sample Theory+1996::ON POOLING COVARIANCE MATRICES FOR MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS+HERTZOG, C+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+SUM 1986::no title+Joreskog, K.

Latent growth curve analysis with dichotomous items: Comparing four approaches,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12058,FEB 2016,42,1,"A Monte Carlo study was used to compare four approaches to growth curve analysis of subjects assessed repeatedly with the same set of dichotomous items: A two-step procedure first estimating latent trait measures using MULTILOG and then using a hierarchical linear model to examine the changing trajectories with the estimated abilities as the outcome variable; a structural equation model using modified weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimation; and two approaches in the framework of multilevel item response models, including a hierarchical generalized linear model using Laplace estimation, and Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). These four methods have similar power in detecting the average linear slope across time. MCMC and Laplace estimates perform relatively better on the bias of the average linear slope and corresponding standard error, as well as the item location parameters. For the variance of the random intercept, and the covariance between the random intercept and slope, all estimates are biased in most conditions. For the random slope variance, only Laplace estimates are unbiased when there are eight time points.","growth curve analysis,Bayesian,hierarchical generalized linear model","ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,HIERARCHICAL MEASUREMENT MODEL,STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,MULTILEVEL MODELS,COVARIANCE STRUCTURE,RANDOMIZED-TRIALS,MONTE-CARLO,IRT,REGRESSION,VARIABLES","Ye, Feifei@Univ Pittsburgh, 5924 Wesley W Posvar Hall,230 South Bouquet St, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Ye, Feifei@University of Pittsburgh@Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE)",not exist,"Multilevel item response models: An approach to errors in variables regression+Adams, RJ; Wilson, M; Wu, M+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SPR 1997::lme4: linear mixed-effects models using Eigen and s4+Bates, D.; Maechler, M.; Bolker, B.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Walker, S</span>.+R package version 1.1-7+2014::A comparison of Bayesian and likelihood-based methods for fitting multilevel models+Browne, William J.; Draper, David+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::no title+Cohen, J.+Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences+1988::Have multilevel models been structural equation models all along?+Curran, PJ+MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH+2003::Comparison of PQL and Laplace 6 estimates of hierarchical linear models when comparing groups of small incident rates in cluster randomised trials+Diaz, Rafael E.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 1 2007::no title+Duncan, T.

In the present study, a test for CI given an exponential family model for accuracy (for example, the Rasch model or the one-parameter logistic model) is proposed and evaluated in a simulation study. The procedure is based on the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.

Detection of differential item functioning in Rasch models by boosting techniques,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12060,FEB 2016,50,4,"Methods for the identification of differential item functioning (DIF) in Rasch models are typically restricted to the case of two subgroups. A boosting algorithm is proposed that is able to handle the more general setting where DIF can be induced by several covariates at the same time. The covariates can be both continuous and (multi-)categorical, and interactions between covariates can also be considered. The method works for a general parametric model for DIF in Rasch models. Since the boosting algorithm selects variables automatically, it is able to detect the items which induce DIF. It is demonstrated that boosting competes well with traditional methods in the case of subgroups. The method is illustrated by an extensive simulation study and an application to real data.","Rasch model,DIF model,differential item functioning,boosting,DIFboost","LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,MULTIPLE GROUPS,SELECTION","Schauberger, Gunther@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Tutz, Gerhard@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Schauberger, Gunther@University of Munich::Tutz, Gerhard@University of Munich",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::no title+AMTHAUER R+INTELLIGENZ STRUKTUR+1973::no title+Amthauer, R.; Brocke, B.; Liepmann, D.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Beauducel, A</span>.+Intelligenz-Struktur-Test 2000 R+2001::no title+Amthauer, RBB; Liepmann, D; Beauducel, A.+Intelligenz-Struktur-Test 2000+1999::Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum,, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::Testing the additional predictive value of high-dimensional molecular data+Boulesteix, Anne-Laure; Hothorn, Torsten+BMC BIOINFORMATICS+FEB 8 2010::The Intelligence Structure Test (I-S-T 70).

A general proof of consistency of heuristic classification for cognitive diagnosis models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12055,NOV 2015,49,2,"The Asymptotic Classification Theory of Cognitive Diagnosis (Chiu etal., 2009, Psychometrika, 74, 633-665) determined the conditions that cognitive diagnosis models must satisfy so that the correct assignment of examinees to proficiency classes is guaranteed when non-parametric classification methods are used. These conditions have only been proven for the Deterministic Input Noisy Output AND gate model. For other cognitive diagnosis models, no theoretical legitimization exists for using non-parametric classification techniques for assigning examinees to proficiency classes. The specific statistical properties of different cognitive diagnosis models require tailored proofs of the conditions of the Asymptotic Classification Theory of Cognitive Diagnosis for each individual model - a tedious undertaking in light of the numerous models presented in the literature. In this paper a different way is presented to address this task. The unified mathematical framework of general cognitive diagnosis models is used as a theoretical basis for a general proof that under mild regularity conditions any cognitive diagnosis model is covered by the Asymptotic Classification Theory of Cognitive Diagnosis.","cognitive diagnosis,general cognitive diagnostic models,generalized DINA,loglinear cognitive diagnosis model,asymptotic theory of classification for cognitive diagnosis,classification,cluster analysis,consistency","DINA MODEL,Q-MATRIX,FAMILY","Chiu, Chia-Yi@Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA::Koehn, Hans-Friedrich@Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Chiu, Chia-Yi@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Koehn, Hans-Friedrich@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign",not exist,"Skill Set Profile Clustering Based on Student Capability Vectors Computed from Online Tutoring Data+Ayers, E; Nugent, R; Dean, N.+ED DATA MINING 2008+2008::no title+Bartholomew, D.

Multilevel multidimensional item response model with a multilevel latent covariate,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12051,NOV 2015,42,4,"In a pre-test-post-test cluster randomized trial, one of the methods commonly used to detect an intervention effect involves controlling pre-test scores and other related covariates while estimating an intervention effect at post-test. In many applications in education, the total post-test and pre-test scores, ignoring measurement error, are used as response variable and covariate, respectively, to estimate the intervention effect. However, these test scores are frequently subject to measurement error, and statistical inferences based on the model ignoring measurement error can yield a biased estimate of the intervention effect. When multiple domains exist in test data, it is sometimes more informative to detect the intervention effect for each domain than for the entire test. This paper presents applications of the multilevel multidimensional item response model with measurement error adjustments in a response variable and a covariate to estimate the intervention effect for each domain.","measurement error,multidimensional item response model,multilevel model","MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE,SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS,STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,MEASUREMENT ERROR,BAYESIAN-APPROACH,FIT ANALYSIS,VARIABLES,ANCOVA","Cho, Sun-Joo@Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37203 USA::Bottge, Brian@Univ Kentucky, Lexington, KY USA","Cho, Sun-Joo@Vanderbilt University::Bottge, Brian@University of Kentucky",not exist,"STATISTICAL MODELING ISSUES IN SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES+AITKIN, M; LONGFORD, N; PLEWIS, IF; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1986::STRUCTURAL MODELING OF MEASUREMENT ERROR IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS WITH RASCH MEASURES AS COVARIATES+Battauz, Michela; Bellio, Ruggero+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JAN 2011::MCMC estimation and some model-fit analysis of multidimensional IRT models+Beguin, AA; Glas, CAW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::BIASED ASSESSMENT OF PROGRAM IMPACT DUE TO PSYCHOMETRIC ARTIFACTS+BEJAR, II+PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN+1980::Effects of Blended Instructional Models on Math Performance+Bottge, Brian A.; Ma, Xin; Gassaway, Linda; et al.+EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN+JUL 2014::no title+Bryk, A.S; Raudenbush, S.W.+Hierarchical linear models+1992::no title+Carroll, R.

On the power of the test for cluster bias,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12053,NOV 2015,51,3,"Cluster bias refers to measurement bias with respect to the clustering variable in multilevel data. The absence of cluster bias implies absence of bias with respect to any cluster-level (level 2) variable. The variables that possibly cause the bias do not have to be measured to test for cluster bias. Therefore, the test for cluster bias serves as a global test of measurement bias with respect to any level 2 variable. However, the validity of the global test depends on the Type I and Type II error rates of the test. We compare the performance of the test for cluster bias with the restricted factor analysis (RFA) test, which can be used if the variable that leads to measurement bias is measured. It appeared that the RFA test has considerably more power than the test for cluster bias. However, the false positive rates of the test for cluster bias were generally around the expected values, while the RFA test showed unacceptably high false positive rates in some conditions. We conclude that if no significant cluster bias is found, still significant bias with respect to a level 2 violator can be detected with an RFA model. Although the test for cluster bias is less powerful, an advantage of the test is that the cause of the bias does not need to be measured, or even known.","cluster bias,measurement bias,multilevel structural equation modelling","COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS,RESTRICTED FACTOR-ANALYSIS,MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE,FACTORIAL INVARIANCE,MULTILEVEL DATA,MODEL,SIMULATION,TEACHERS,IRT","Jak, Suzanne@Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands@Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore::Oort, Frans J.@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands","Jak, Suzanne@National University of Singapore@Utrecht University::Oort, Frans J.@University of Amsterdam",not exist,"Using restricted factor analysis with latent moderated structures to detect uniform and nonuniform measurement bias; a simulation study+Barendse, M.

A mixture hierarchical model for response times and response accuracy,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12054,NOV 2015,28,17,"In real testing, examinees may manifest different types of test-taking behaviours. In this paper we focus on two types that appear to be among the more frequently occurring behaviours - solution behaviour and rapid guessing behaviour. Rapid guessing usually happens in high-stakes tests when there is insufficient time, and in low-stakes tests when there is lack of effort. These two qualitatively different test-taking behaviours, if ignored, will lead to violation of the local independence assumption and, as a result, yield biased item/person parameter estimation. We propose a mixture hierarchical model to account for differences among item responses and response time patterns arising from these two behaviours. The model is also able to identify the specific behaviour an examinee engages in when answering an item. A Monte Carlo expectation maximization algorithm is proposed for model calibration. A simulation study shows that the new model yields more accurate item and person parameter estimates than a non-mixture model when the data indeed come from two types of behaviour. The model also fits real, high-stakes test data better than a non-mixture model, and therefore the new model can better identify the underlying test-taking behaviour an examinee engages in on a certain item.","response time,mixture hierarchical model,rapid guessing","PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,TEST SPEEDEDNESS,EM ALGORITHM,RASCH MODEL,PERSON-FIT,FRAMEWORK","Wang, Chun@Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Xu, Gongjun@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Wang, Chun@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System::Xu, Gongjun@University of Minnesota Twin Cities@University of Minnesota System",not exist,"Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum,, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::Item parameter estimation under conditions of test speededness: Application of a mixture Rasch model with ordinal constraints+Bolt, DM; Cohen, AS; Wollack, JA+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+WIN 2002::A HYBRID Model for Test Speededness+Boughton, Keith A.; Yamamoto, Kentaro+MULTIVARIATE AND MIXTURE DISTRIBUTION RASCH MODELS: EXTENSIONS AND APPLICATIONS+2007::A Speeded Item Response Model: Leave the Harder till Later+Chang, Yu-Wei; Tsai, Rung-Ching; Hsu, Nan-Jung+PSYCHOMETRIKA+APR 2014::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::A speeded item response model with gradual process change+Goegebeur, Yuri; De Boeck, Paul; Wollack, James A.; et al.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2008::no title+Hambleton,, R.

A generalized linear factor model approach to the hierarchical framework for responses and response times,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12042,MAY 2015,61,12,"We show how the hierarchical model for responses and response times as developed by van der Linden (2007), Fox, Klein Entink, and van der Linden (2007), Klein Entink, Fox, and van der Linden (2009), and Glas and van der Linden (2010) can be simplified to a generalized linear factor model with only the mild restriction that there is no hierarchical model at the item side. This result is valuable as it enables all well-developed modelling tools and extensions that come with these methods. We show that the restriction we impose on the hierarchical model does not influence parameter recovery under realistic circumstances. In addition, we present two illustrative real data analyses to demonstrate the practical benefits of our approach.","response time modelling,generalized linear factor model,conditional independence,method variance,censoring","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,ITEM RESPONSES,PARAMETERS,VARIABLES,ACCURACY,TESTS,SPEED","Molenaar, Dylan@Univ Amsterdam, NL-1018 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands::Tuerlinckx, Francis@Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium::van der Maas, Han L.

Properties of hypothesis testing techniques and (Bayesian) model selection for exploration-based and theory-based (order-restricted) hypotheses,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12041,MAY 2015,33,0,"In this paper, the performance of six types of techniques for comparisons of means is examined. These six emerge from the distinction between the method employed (hypothesis testing, model selection using information criteria, or Bayesian model selection) and the set of hypotheses that is investigated (a classical, exploration-based set of hypotheses containing equality constraints on the means, or a theory-based limited set of hypotheses with equality and/or order restrictions). A simulation study is conducted to examine the performance of these techniques. We demonstrate that, if one has specific, a priori specified hypotheses, confirmation (i.e., investigating theory-based hypotheses) has advantages over exploration (i.e., examining all possible equality-constrained hypotheses). Furthermore, examining reasonable order-restricted hypotheses has more power to detect the true effect/non-null hypothesis than evaluating only equality restrictions. Additionally, when investigating more than one theory-based hypothesis, model selection is preferred over hypothesis testing. Because of the first two results, we further examine the techniques that are able to evaluate order restrictions in a confirmatory fashion by examining their performance when the homogeneity of variance assumption is violated. Results show that the techniques are robust to heterogeneity when the sample sizes are equal. When the sample sizes are unequal, the performance is affected by heterogeneity. The size and direction of the deviations from the baseline, where there is no heterogeneity, depend on the effect size (of the means) and on the trend in the group variances with respect to the ordering of the group sizes. Importantly, the deviations are less pronounced when the group variances and sizes exhibit the same trend (e.g., are both increasing with group number).","confirmation,heterogeneity,hypothesis testing,(Bayesian) model selection,order-restricted constraints","EQUALITY CONSTRAINED MODELS,INFORMATION CRITERION,FORTRAN-90 PROGRAM,ANOVA DESIGNS,INEQUALITY,VARIANCE","Kuiper, Rebecca M.@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands::Nederhoff, Tim@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands::Klugkist, Irene@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Kuiper, Rebecca M.@Utrecht University::Nederhoff, Tim@Utrecht University::Klugkist, Irene@Utrecht University",not exist,"An information criterion for parameters under a simple order restriction+Anraku, K+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1999::SOME THEOREMS ON QUADRATIC FORMS APPLIED IN THE STUDY OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE PROBLEMS .1.

Bias in longitudinal data analysis with missing data using typical linear mixed-effects modelling and pattern-mixture approach: An analytical illustration,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12043,MAY 2015,31,1,"We analytically derive the fixed-effects estimates in unconditional linear growth curve models by typical linear mixed-effects modelling (TLME) and by a pattern-mixture (PM) approach with random-slope-dependent two-missing-pattern missing not at random (MNAR) longitudinal data. Results showed that when the missingness mechanism is random-slope-dependent MNAR, TLME estimates of both the mean intercept and mean slope are biased because of incorrect weights used in the estimation. More specifically, the estimate of the mean slope is biased towards the mean slope for completers, whereas the estimate of the mean intercept is biased towards the opposite direction as compared to the estimate of the mean slope. We also discuss why the PM approach can provide unbiased fixed-effects estimates for random-coefficients-dependent MNAR data but does not work well for missing at random or outcome-dependent MNAR data. A small simulation study was conducted to illustrate the results and to compare results from TLME and PM. Results from an empirical data analysis showed that the conceptual finding can be generalized to other real conditions even when some assumptions for the analytical derivation cannot be met. Implications from the analytical and empirical results were discussed and sensitivity analysis was suggested for longitudinal data analysis with missing data.",,"INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES,NONIGNORABLE DROPOUT,INCOMPLETE DATA,GROWTH","Yang, Manshu@Amer Inst Res, Hlth & Social Dev Program, Chapel Hill, NC USA::Wang, Lijuan@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA::Maxwell, Scott E.@Univ Notre Dame, Dept Psychol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Yang, Manshu@American Institutes for Research::Wang, Lijuan@University of Notre Dame::Maxwell, Scott E.@University of Notre Dame",not exist,"History and rationale of longitudinal research+Baltes, P.

Heuristic cognitive diagnosis when the Q-matrix is unknown,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12044,MAY 2015,39,4,"Cognitive diagnosis models of educational test performance rely on a binary Q-matrix that specifies the associations between individual test items and the cognitive attributes (skills) required to answer those items correctly. Current methods for fitting cognitive diagnosis models to educational test data and assigning examinees to proficiency classes are based on parametric estimation methods such as expectation maximization (EM) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that frequently encounter difficulties in practical applications. In response to these difficulties, non-parametric classification techniques (cluster analysis) have been proposed as heuristic alternatives to parametric procedures. These non-parametric classification techniques first aggregate each examinee's test item scores into a profile of attribute sum scores, which then serve as the basis for clustering examinees into proficiency classes. Like the parametric procedures, the non-parametric classification techniques require that the Q-matrix underlying a given test be known. Unfortunately, in practice, the Q-matrix for most tests is not known and must be estimated to specify the associations between items and attributes, risking a misspecified Q-matrix that may then result in the incorrect classification of examinees. This paper demonstrates that clustering examinees into proficiency classes based on their item scores rather than on their attribute sum-score profiles does not require knowledge of the Q-matrix, and results in a more accurate classification of examinees.","cognitive diagnosis,asymptotic theory of cognitive diagnosis,consistency,clustering,classification,heuristic","DINA MODEL,CLASSIFICATION","Koehn, Hans-Friedrich@Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA::Chiu, Chia-Yi@Rutgers State Univ, Dept Educ Psychol, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA::Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Koehn, Hans-Friedrich@University of Illinois System@University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign::Chiu, Chia-Yi@Rutgers State University New Brunswick::Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State University@State University System of Florida",not exist,"Skill Set Profile Clustering Based on Student Capability Vectors Computed from Online Tutoring Data+Ayers, E; Nugent, R; Dean, N.+ED DATA MINING 2008+2008::Clustering methods: a history of k-means algorithms+Bock, HH.+Selected contributions in data analysis and classification.+2007::Statistical Refinement of the Q-Matrix in Cognitive Diagnosis+Chiu, Chia-Yi+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+NOV 2013::A Nonparametric Approach to Cognitive Diagnosis by Proximity to Ideal Response Patterns+Chiu, Chia-Yi; Douglas, Jeff+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+JUL 2013::Cluster Analysis for Cognitive Diagnosis: Theory and Applications+Chiu, Chia-Yi; Douglas, Jeffrey A.; Li, Xiaodong+PSYCHOMETRIKA+DEC 2009::DINA Model and Parameter Estimation: A Didactic+de la Torre, Jimmy+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+MAR 2009::An Empirically Based Method of Q-Matrix Validation for the DINA Model: Development and Applications+de la Torre, Jimmy+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+WIN 2008::The Generalized DINA Model Framework+de la Torre, Jimmy+PSYCHOMETRIKA+APR 2011::On the Analysis of Fraction Subtraction Data: The DINA Model, Classification, Latent Class Sizes, and the Q-Matrix+DeCarlo, Lawrence T.+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JAN 2011::Review of Cognitively Diagnostic Assessment and a Summary of Psychometric Models+DiBello, Louis V.; Roussos, Louis A.; Stout, William+PSYCHOMETRICS+2007::Model evaluation and multiple strategies in cognitive diagnosis analysis of fraction subtraction data+Douglas, J.

Equivalence tests for comparing correlation and regression coefficients,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12045,MAY 2015,35,1,"Equivalence tests are an alternative to traditional difference-based tests for demonstrating a lack of association between two variables. While there are several recent studies investigating equivalence tests for comparing means, little research has been conducted on equivalence methods for evaluating the equivalence or similarity of two correlation coefficients or two regression coefficients. The current project proposes novel tests for evaluating the equivalence of two regression or correlation coefficients derived from the two one-sided tests (TOST) method (Schuirmann, 1987, J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm, 15, 657) and an equivalence test by Anderson and Hauck (1983, Stat. Commun., 12, 2663). A simulation study was used to evaluate the performance of these tests and compare them with the common, yet inappropriate, method of assessing equivalence using non-rejection of the null hypothesis in difference-based tests. Results demonstrate that equivalence tests have more accurate probabilities of declaring equivalence than difference-based tests. However, equivalence tests require large sample sizes to ensure adequate power. We recommend the Anderson-Hauck equivalence test over the TOST method for comparing correlation or regression coefficients.","equivalence testing,regression,correlation","CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,COMPARATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY,BIOEQUIVALENCE TRIALS,CLINICAL-TRIALS,HYPOTHESIS,ABSENCE,POWER","Counsell, Alyssa@York Univ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada::Cribbie, Robert A.@York Univ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","Counsell, Alyssa@York University - Canada::Cribbie, Robert A.@York University - Canada",not exist,"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence - We need to report uncertain results and do it clearly+Alderson, P+BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+FEB 28 2004::A NEW PROCEDURE FOR TESTING EQUIVALENCE IN COMPARATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY AND OTHER CLINICAL-TRIALS+ANDERSON, S; HAUCK, WW+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1983::Bioequivalence trials, intersection-union tests and equivalence confidence sets+Berger, RL; Hsu, JC+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 1996::PROVING THE NULL HYPOTHESIS IN CLINICAL-TRIALS+BLACKWELDER, WC+CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS+1982::An empirical study of related correlation coefficients+Boyer, J.

A generalized distance function for preferential choices,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12048,MAY 2015,33,2,"Many cognitive theories of judgement and decision making assume that choice options are evaluated relative to other available options. The extent to which the preference for one option is influenced by other available options will often depend on how similar the options are to each other, where similarity is assumed to be a decreasing function of the distance between options. We examine how the distance between preferential options that are described on multiple attributes can be determined. Previous distance functions do not take into account that attributes differ in their subjective importance, are limited to two attributes, or neglect the preferential relationship between the options. To measure the distance between preferential options it is necessary to take the subjective preferences of the decision maker into account. Accordingly, the multi-attribute space that defines the relationship between options can be stretched or shrunk relative to the attention or importance that a person gives to different attributes describing the options. Here, we propose a generalized distance function for preferential choices that takes subjective attribute importance into account and allows for individual differences according to such subjective preferences. Using a hands-on example, we illustrate the application of the function and compare it to previous distance measures. We conclude with a discussion of the suitability and limitations of the proposed distance function.","distance,similarity,preferential choice,multi-attribute,decision-making","DECISION FIELD-THEORY,ACCUMULATOR MODEL,CONTEXT,SIMILARITY,EXEMPLAR,CATEGORIZATION,ELIMINATION,HYPOTHESIS,ATTENTION,PROTOTYPE","Berkowitsch, Nicolas A.

The predictive accuracy of intertemporal-choice models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12049,MAY 2015,47,1,"How do people choose between a smaller reward available sooner and a larger reward available later? Past research has evaluated models of intertemporal choice by measuring goodness of fit or identifying which decision-making anomalies they can accommodate. An alternative criterion for model quality, which is partly antithetical to these standard criteria, is predictive accuracy. We used cross-validation to examine how well 10 models of intertemporal choice could predict behaviour in a 100-trial binary-decision task. Many models achieved the apparent ceiling of 85% accuracy, even with smaller training sets. When noise was added to the training set, however, a simple logistic-regression model we call the difference model performed particularly well. In many situations, between-model differences in predictive accuracy may be small, contrary to long-standing controversy over the modelling question in research on intertemporal choice, but the simplicity and robustness of the difference model recommend it to future use.","intertemporal choice,predictive validity,mathematical modeling,machine learning","HYPOTHETICAL REWARDS,DELAYED REWARDS,SELF-CONTROL,PREFERENCE REVERSALS,DISCOUNTING MODELS,MONETARY REWARDS,TIME PREFERENCE,REAL,REINFORCEMENT,PSYCHOLOGY","Arfer, Kodi B.@SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA::Luhmann, Christian C.@SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Arfer, Kodi B.@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@State University of New York (SUNY) System::Luhmann, Christian C.@State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook@State University of New York (SUNY) System",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Present-bias, quasi-hyperbolic discounting, and fixed costs+Benhabib, Jess; Bisin, Alberto; Schotter, Andrew+GAMES AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR+JUL 2010::A Criticism of Doyle's survey of time preference: A correction regarding the CRDI and CADI families+Bleichrodt, Han; van Loon, Rogier J.

Modelling partially cross-classified multilevel data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12050,MAY 2015,24,3,This article proposes an approach to modelling partially cross-classified multilevel data where some of the level-1 observations are nested in one random factor and some are cross-classified by two random factors. Comparisons between a proposed approach to two other commonly used approaches which treat the partially cross-classified data as either fully nested or fully cross-classified are completed with a simulation study. Results show that the proposed approach demonstrates desirable performance in terms of parameter estimates and statistical inferences. Both the fully nested model and the fully cross-classified model suffer from biased estimates of some variance components and statistical inferences of some fixed effects. Results also indicate that the proposed model is robust against cluster size imbalance.,"cross-classified random effects models,partially cross-classified data,multilevel data","MONTE-CARLO,DESIGN,SCHOOL,TRIAL","Luo, Wen@Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA::Cappaert, Kevin J.@Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI USA::Ning, Ling@Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Luo, Wen@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station::Cappaert, Kevin J.@University of Wisconsin Milwaukee@University of Wisconsin System::Ning, Ling@Texas A&M University System@Texas A&M University College Station","Ning, Ling@E-8193-2018","Evaluating Models for Partially Clustered Designs+Baldwin, Scott A.; Bauer, Daniel J.; Stice, Eric; et al.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+JUN 2011::no title+Bates, D.

Prediction of true test scores from observed item scores and ancillary data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12052,MAY 2015,22,2,"In many educational tests which involve constructed responses, a traditional test score is obtained by adding together item scores obtained through holistic scoring by trained human raters. For example, this practice was used until 2008 in the case of GRE((R))General Analytical Writing and until 2009 in the case of TOEFL (R) iBT Writing. With use of natural language processing, it is possible to obtain additional information concerning item responses from computer programs such as e-rater((R)). In addition, available information relevant to examinee performance may include scores on related tests. We suggest application of standard results from classical test theory to the available data to obtain best linear predictors of true traditional test scores. In performing such analysis, we require estimation of variances and covariances of measurement errors, a task which can be quite difficult in the case of tests with limited numbers of items and with multiple measurements per item. As a consequence, a new estimation method is suggested based on samples of examinees who have taken an assessment more than once. Such samples are typically not random samples of the general population of examinees, so that we apply statistical adjustment methods to obtain the needed estimated variances and covariances of measurement errors. To examine practical implications of the suggested methods of analysis, applications are made to GRE General Analytical Writing and TOEFL iBT Writing. Results obtained indicate that substantial improvements are possible both in terms of reliability of scoring and in terms of assessment reliability.","automated scoring,holistic scoring,augmentation,classical test theory,adjustment,reliability,proportional reduction in mean square error",,"Haberman, Shelby J.@Educ Testing Serv, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA::Yao, Lili@Educ Testing Serv, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA::Sinharay, Sandip@Educ Testing Serv, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA","Haberman, Shelby J.@Educational Testing Service (ETS)::Yao, Lili@Educational Testing Service (ETS)::Sinharay, Sandip@Educational Testing Service (ETS)",not exist,"Automated essay evaluation: The Criterion Online writing service+Burstein, F; Chodorow, M; Leacock, C+AI MAGAZINE+FAL 2004::Automated essay scoring with e-rater&amp;REG; v. 2.0+Burstein, J.; Attali, Y.+&lt;IT&gt;Journal of Technology, Learning and Assessment&lt;/IT&gt;+2006::I-DIVERGENCE GEOMETRY OF PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND MINIMIZATION PROBLEMS+CSISZAR, I+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+1975::Principles for building and evaluating e-rater models+Davey, T.+ANN M NAT COUNC MEAS+May 2009::no title+Gulliksen, H.+Theory of Mental Tests+1950::Use of e-rater in scoring of TOEFL iBT writing test+Haberman, S.

On the explaining-away phenomenon in multivariate latent variable models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12046,FEB 2015,70,2,"Many probabilistic models for psychological and educational measurements contain latent variables. Well-known examples are factor analysis, item response theory, and latent class model families. We discuss what is referred to as the explaining-away' phenomenon in the context of such latent variable models. This phenomenon can occur when multiple latent variables are related to the same observed variable, and can elicit seemingly counterintuitive conditional dependencies between latent variables given observed variables. We illustrate the implications of explaining away for a number of well-known latent variable models by using both theoretical and real data examples.","Explaining-away phenomenon,conditional dependence,latent variables,factor analysis,item response theory","ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,MULTIDIMENSIONAL IRT MODEL,BI-FACTOR,BUNDLES,FRAMEWORK,INFERENCE,SCORES","van Rijn, Peter@ETS Global, NL-1077 XX Amsterdam, Netherlands::Rijmen, Frank@CTB McGraw Hill, Monterey, CA USA","van Rijn, Peter@Unknow::Rijmen, Frank@Unknow",not exist,"The multidimensional random coefficients multinomial logit model+Adams, RJ; Wilson, M; Wang, WC+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+MAR 1997::Statistical interference in factor analysis+Anderson, T.; Rubin, H.+P 3 BERK S MATH STAT+1956::THE FOUNDATIONS OF FACTOR-ANALYSIS+BARTHOLOMEW, DJ+BIOMETRIKA+1984::POSTERIOR ANALYSIS OF THE FACTOR MODEL+BARTHOLOMEW, DJ+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1981::LIMITATIONS OF THE APPLICATION OF FOURFOLD TABLE ANALYSIS TO HOSPITAL DATA+BERKSON, J+BIOMETRICS BULLETIN+1946::Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum,, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::no title+Bishop, C.

Non-parametric three-way mixed ANOVA with aligned rank tests,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12031,FEB 2015,33,4,"Research problems that require a non-parametric analysis of multifactor designs with repeated measures arise in the behavioural sciences. There is, however, a lack of available procedures in commonly used statistical packages. In the present study, a generalization of the aligned rank test for the two-way interaction is proposed for the analysis of the typical sources of variation in a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. It can be implemented in the usual statistical packages. Its statistical properties are tested by using simulation methods with two sample sizes (n=30 and n=10) and three distributions (normal, exponential and double exponential). Results indicate substantial increases in power for non-normal distributions in comparison with the usual parametric tests. Similar levels of Type I error for both parametric and aligned rank ANOVA were obtained with non-normal distributions and large sample sizes. Degrees-of-freedom adjustments for Type I error control in small samples are proposed. The procedure is applied to a case study with 30 participants per group where it detects gender differences in linguistic abilities in blind children not shown previously by other methods.",,"REPEATED-MEASURES DESIGNS,FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,MULTIVARIATE,TRANSFORM,ROBUST,POWER,STATISTICS","Oliver-Rodriguez, Juan C.@Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain::Wang, X.

Reliability measures in item response theory: Manifest versus latent correlation functions,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12033,FEB 2015,25,3,"For item response theory (IRT) models, which belong to the class of generalized linear or non-linear mixed models, reliability at the scale of observed scores (i.e., manifest correlation) is more difficult to calculate than latent correlation based reliability, but usually of greater scientific interest. This is not least because it cannot be calculated explicitly when the logit link is used in conjunction with normal random effects. As such, approximations such as Fisher's information coefficient, Cronbach's , or the latent correlation are calculated, allegedly because it is easy to do so. Cronbach's has well-known and serious drawbacks, Fisher's information is not meaningful under certain circumstances, and there is an important but often overlooked difference between latent and manifest correlations. Here, manifest correlation refers to correlation between observed scores, while latent correlation refers to correlation between scores at the latent (e.g., logit or probit) scale. Thus, using one in place of the other can lead to erroneous conclusions. Taylor series based reliability measures, which are based on manifest correlation functions, are derived and a careful comparison of reliability measures based on latent correlations, Fisher's information, and exact reliability is carried out. The latent correlations are virtually always considerably higher than their manifest counterparts, Fisher's information measure shows no coherent behaviour (it is even negative in some cases), while the newly introduced Taylor series based approximations reflect the exact reliability very closely.

Polytomous multilevel testlet models for testlet-based assessments with complex sampling designs,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12035,FEB 2015,42,2,"Applications of standard item response theory models assume local independence of items and persons. This paper presents polytomous multilevel testlet models for dual dependence due to item and person clustering in testlet-based assessments with clustered samples. Simulation and survey data were analysed with a multilevel partial credit testlet model. This model was compared with three alternative models - a testlet partial credit model (PCM), multilevel PCM, and PCM - in terms of model parameter estimation. The results indicated that the deviance information criterion was the fit index that always correctly identified the true multilevel testlet model based on the quantified evidence in model selection, while the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria could not identify the true model. In general, the estimation model and the magnitude of item and person clustering impacted the estimation accuracy of ability parameters, while only the estimation model and the magnitude of item clustering affected the item parameter estimation accuracy. Furthermore, ignoring item clustering effects produced higher total errors in item parameter estimates but did not have much impact on the accuracy of ability parameter estimates, while ignoring person clustering effects yielded higher total errors in ability parameter estimates but did not have much effect on the accuracy of item parameter estimates. When both clustering effects were ignored in the PCM, item and ability parameter estimation accuracy was reduced.","local dependence,local item dependence,polytomous multilevel testlet model,partial credit model,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Bayesian analysis,model fit,deviance information criterion,Akaike information criterion,Bayesian information criterion","ITEM RESPONSE THEORY,PARTIAL CREDIT MODEL,LOCAL DEPENDENCE,PERFORMANCE,FRAMEWORK,DIMENSION,FIT","Jiao, Hong@Univ Maryland, Dept Human Dev & Quantitat Methodol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA::Zhang, Yuan@Univ Maryland, Dept Human Dev & Quantitat Methodol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Jiao, Hong@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park::Zhang, Yuan@University System of Maryland@University of Maryland College Park",not exist,"no title+Ackerman, T.+The robustness of LOGIST and BILOG IRT estimation programs to violations of local independence+1987::Multilevel item response models: An approach to errors in variables regression+Adams, RJ; Wilson, M; Wu, M+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+SPR 1997::NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::no title+Anderson, DR.+Model based inference in the life sciences: a primer on evidence+2008::The effects of ignoring item and person clustering on ability estimation and classification decisions+Binici, S.; Kamata, A.; Jiao, H.+PAPER PRESENTED AT T+2010::A Bayesian random effects model for testlets+Bradlow, ET; Wainer, H; Wang, XH+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 1999::General methods for monitoring convergence of iterative simulations+Brooks, SP; Gelman, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 1998::Local dependence indexes for item pairs: Using item response theory+Chen, WH; Thissen, D+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+FAL 1997::no title+Cochrane, WG.+Sampling techniques+1977::no title+Cohen, J.+Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences+1969::no title+no author+Explanatory item response models: A generalized linear and nonlinear approach+2004::Using item response theory to measure extreme response style in marketing research: A global investigation+De Jong, Martijn G.; Steenkamp, Jan-Benedict E.

Significance tests to determine the direction of effects in linear regression models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12037,FEB 2015,67,13,"Previous studies have discussed asymmetric interpretations of the Pearson correlation coefficient and have shown that higher moments can be used to decide on the direction of dependence in the bivariate linear regression setting. The current study extends this approach by illustrating that the third moment of regression residuals may also be used to derive conclusions concerning the direction of effects. Assuming non-normally distributed variables, it is shown that the distribution of residuals of the correctly specified regression model (e.g., Y is regressed on X) is more symmetric than the distribution of residuals of the competing model (i.e., X is regressed on Y). Based on this result, 4 one-sample tests are discussed which can be used to decide which variable is more likely to be the response and which one is more likely to be the explanatory variable. A fifth significance test is proposed based on the differences of skewness estimates, which leads to a more direct test of a hypothesis that is compatible with direction of dependence. A Monte Carlo simulation study was performed to examine the behaviour of the procedures under various degrees of associations, sample sizes, and distributional properties of the underlying population. An empirical example is given which illustrates the application of the tests in practice.","direction of dependence,skewness,residuals,significance test,bootstrap","NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS,CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT,NON-NORMALITY,SAMPLE TESTS,ERROR RATES,DEPENDENCE,ROBUSTNESS,RESIDUALS,MEDIATION,MOMENTS","Wiedermann, Wolfgang@Univ Vienna, Dept Psychol, A-1010 Vienna, Austria::Hagmann, Michael@Univ Vienna, Dept Psychol, A-1010 Vienna, Austria::von Eye, Alexander@Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Wiedermann, Wolfgang@University of Vienna::Hagmann, Michael@University of Vienna::von Eye, Alexander@Michigan State University","Wiedermann, Wolfgang@H-2203-2018","ROBUST METHOD FOR MULTIPLE LINEAR-REGRESSION+ANDREWS, DF+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::The moderator- mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations+Baron, R.

An investigation of DIF mechanisms in the context of differential testlet effects,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12039,FEB 2015,24,0,"This study investigated differential item functioning (DIF) mechanisms in the context of differential testlet effects across subgroups. Specifically, we investigated DIF manifestations when the stochastic ordering assumption on the nuisance dimension in a testlet does not hold. DIF hypotheses were formulated analytically using a parametric marginal item response function approach and compared with empirical DIF results from a unidimensional item response theory approach. The comparisons were made in terms of type of DIF (uniform or non-uniform) and direction (whether the focal or reference group was advantaged). In general, the DIF hypotheses were supported by the empirical results, showing the usefulness of the parametric approach in explaining DIF mechanisms. Both analytical predictions of DIF and the empirical results provide insights into conditions where a particular type of DIF becomes dominant in a specific DIF direction, which is useful for the study of DIF causes.","potential for DIF,testlet effect,DIF,DIF mechanism,multidimensionality and DIF","RESPONSE MODEL,CROSSING DIF,ITEM,IMPACT","Paek, Insu@Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Fukuhara, Hirotaka@Pearson, San Antonio, TX USA","Paek, Insu@Florida State University@State University System of Florida::Fukuhara, Hirotaka@Unknow",not exist,"A DIDACTIC EXPLANATION OF ITEM BIAS, ITEM IMPACT, AND ITEM VALIDITY FROM A MULTIDIMENSIONAL PERSPECTIVE+ACKERMAN, TA+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT+SPR 1992::A CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENTIAL ITEM FUNCTIONING IN TERMS OF A MULTIDIMENSIONAL ITEM RESPONSE MODEL+CAMILLI, G+APPLIED PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+JUN 1992::Type I Error Inflation for Detecting DIF in the Presence of Impact+DeMars, Christine E.+EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT+DEC 2010::Application of think-aloud protocols in examining sources of differential item functioning+Ercikan, K.; Arim, R.

A threshold theory account of psychometric functions with response confidence under the balance condition,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12040,FEB 2015,54,2,"The study of thresholds for discriminability has been of long-standing interest in psychophysics. While threshold theories embrace the concept of discrete-state thresholds, signal detection theory discounts such a concept. In this paper we concern ourselves with the concept of thresholds from the discrete-state modelling viewpoint. In doing so, we find it necessary to clarify some fundamental issues germane to the psychometric function (PF), which is customarily constructed using psychophysical methods with a binary-response format. We challenge this response format and argue that response confidence also plays an important role in the construction of PFs, and thus should have some impact on threshold estimation. We motivate the discussion by adopting a three-state threshold theory for response confidence proposed by Krantz (1969, Psychol. Rev., 76, 308-324), which is a modification of Luce's (1963, Psychol. Rev., 70, 61-79) low-threshold theory. In particular, we discuss the case in which the practice of averaging over order (or position) is enforced in data collection. Finally, we illustrate the fit of the Luce-Krantz model to data from a line-discrimination task with response confidence.","balance condition,psychometric function,response confidence,threshold theory","MINIMUM-DESCRIPTION LENGTH,RECOGNITION MEMORY,SIGNAL-DETECTION,CONTRAST DETECTION,DIFFERENCE MODEL,INTERVAL BIAS,TIME ERRORS,CHOICE,TASKS,DISCRIMINATION","Hsu, Yung-Fong@Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Psychol, Taipei 10617, Taiwan::Doble, Christopher W.@Aleks Corp, Irvine, CA USA","Hsu, Yung-Fong@National Taiwan University::Doble, Christopher W.@Unknow","HSU, YUNG-FONG@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5193-9718","Some more sensitive measures of sensitivity and response bias+Balakrishnan, JD+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+MAR 1998::no title+Blackwell, H.

Fitting direct covariance structures by the MSTRUCT modeling language of the CALIS procedure,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12034,FEB 2015,19,0,"This paper demonstrates the usefulness and flexibility of the general structural equation modelling (SEM) approach to fitting direct covariance patterns or structures (as opposed to fitting implied covariance structures from functional relationships among variables). In particular, the MSTRUCT modelling language (or syntax) of the CALIS procedure (SAS/STAT version 9.22 or later: SAS Institute, 2010) is used to illustrate the SEM approach. The MSTRUCT modelling language supports a direct covariance pattern specification of each covariance element. It also supports the input of additional independent and dependent parameters. Model tests, fit statistics, estimates, and their standard errors are then produced under the general SEM framework. By using numerical and computational examples, the following tests of basic covariance patterns are illustrated: sphericity, compound symmetry, and multiple-group covariance patterns. Specification and testing of two complex correlation structures, the circumplex pattern and the composite direct product models with or without composite errors and scales, are also illustrated by the MSTRUCT syntax. It is concluded that the SEM approach offers a general and flexible modelling of direct covariance and correlation patterns. In conjunction with the use of SAS macros, the MSTRUCT syntax provides an easy-to-use interface for specifying and fitting complex covariance and correlation structures, even when the number of variables or parameters becomes large.","covariance structure analysis,covariance patterns,direct product models","DIRECT-PRODUCT MODEL,MATRICES","Yung, Yiu-Fai@SAS Inst Inc, Multivariate Modeling & Res, Cary, NC 27513 USA::Browne, Michael W.@Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA::Zhang, Wei@SAS Inst Inc, Multivariate Modeling & Res, Cary, NC 27513 USA","Yung, Yiu-Fai@Unknow::Browne, Michael W.@Ohio State University::Zhang, Wei@Unknow",not exist,"Some stochastic process models for intelligence test scores+Anderson,, T.W.+MATH METHODS SOCIAL+1960::no title+Arbuckle,, J.

Meta-analysis methods for risk differences,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12024,NOV 2014,26,3,"The difference between two proportions, referred to as a risk difference, is a useful measure of effect size in studies where the response variable is dichotomous. Confidence interval methods based on a varying coefficient model are proposed for combining and comparing risk differences from multi-study between-subjects or within-subjects designs. The proposed methods are new alternatives to the popular constant coefficient and random coefficient methods. The proposed varying coefficient methods do not require the constant coefficient assumption of effect size homogeneity, nor do they require the random coefficient assumption that the risk differences from the selected studies represent a random sample from a normally distributed superpopulation of risk differences. The proposed varying coefficient methods are shown to have excellent finite-sample performance characteristics under realistic conditions.",,"BINOMIAL PROPORTIONS,CONFIDENCE-INTERVAL,SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER,DOUBLE-BLIND,PAIRED DATA,ARIPIPRAZOLE,PLACEBO,SCHIZOPHRENIA,SAFETY,EFFICACY","Bonett, Douglas G.@Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Psychol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA::Price, Robert M.@E Tennessee State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Johnson City, TN 37614 USA","Bonett, Douglas G.@University of California Santa Cruz@University of California System::Price, Robert M.@East Tennessee State University",not exist,"Simple and effective confidence intervals for proportions and differences of proportions result from adding two successes and two failures+Agresti, A; Caffo, B+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2000::Best-practice recommendations for estimating interaction effects using meta-analysis+Aguinis, Herman; Gottfredson, Ryan K.; Wright, Thomas A.+JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR+NOV 2011::no title+no author+Publication manual of the American Psychological Association+2010::Adjusted Wald Confidence Interval for a Difference of Binomial Proportions Based on Paired Data+Bonett, Douglas G.; Price, Robert M.+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS+AUG 2012::Varying Coefficient Meta-Analytic Methods for Alpha Reliability+Bonett, Douglas G.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+DEC 2010::Meta-Analytic Interval Estimation for Standardized and Unstandardized Mean Differences+Bonett, Douglas G.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2009::Meta-analytic interval estimation for bivariate correlations+Bonett, Douglas G.+PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS+SEP 2008::no title+Borenstein, M.; Hedges, L.

An accumulator model for responses and response times in tests based on the proportional hazards model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12025,NOV 2014,44,5,"Latent trait models for responses and response times in tests often lack a substantial interpretation in terms of a cognitive process model. This is a drawback because process models are helpful in clarifying the meaning of the latent traits. In the present paper, a new model for responses and response times in tests is presented. The model is based on the proportional hazards model for competing risks. Two processes are assumed, one reflecting the increase in knowledge and the second the tendency to discontinue. The processes can be characterized by two proportional hazards models whose baseline hazard functions correspond to the temporary increase in knowledge and discouragement. The model can be calibrated with marginal maximum likelihood estimation and an application of the ECM algorithm. Two tests of model fit are proposed. The amenability of the proposed approaches to model calibration and model evaluation is demonstrated in a simulation study. Finally, the model is used for the analysis of two empirical data sets.",,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,CHOICE,FRAMEWORK,DECISIONS,PARAMETER,TABLES,SPEED","Ranger, Jochen@Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Psychol, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany::Kuhn, Joerg-Tobias@Univ Munster, Dept Psychol, Munster, Germany","Ranger, Jochen@Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg::Kuhn, Joerg-Tobias@University of Munster",not exist,"Understanding the shape of the hazard rate: A process point of view+Aalen, OO; Gjessing, HK+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 2001::The identifiability of the mixed proportional hazards competing risks model+Abbring, JH; van den Berg, GJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::SCIENCE AND STATISTICS+BOX, GEP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1976::A ballistic model of choice response time+Brown, S; Heathcote, A+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+JAN 2005::The simplest complete model of choice response time: Linear ballistic accumulation+Brown, Scott D.; Heathcote, Andrew+COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY+NOV 2008::Mixed model-based hazard estimation+Cai, T; Hyndman, RJ; Wand, MP+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2002::THE USE OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES IN X2 TESTS FOR GOODNESS OF FIT+CHERNOFF, H; LEHMANN, EL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1954::Decisions in Changing Conditions: The Urgency-Gating Model+Cisek, Paul; Puskas, Genevieve Aude; El-Murr, Stephany+JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE+SEP 16 2009::REGRESSION MODELS AND LIFE-TABLES+COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::Evaluating Cognitive Theory: A Joint Modeling Approach Using Responses and Response Times+Entink, Rinke H.

Should we rely on the Kenward-Roger approximation when using linear mixed models if the groups have different distributions?,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12026,NOV 2014,56,4,"The study explores the robustness to violations of normality and sphericity of linear mixed models when they are used with the Kenward-Roger procedure (KR) in split-plot designs in which the groups have different distributions and sample sizes are small. The focus is on examining the effect of skewness and kurtosis. To this end, a Monte Carlo simulation study was carried out, involving a split-plot design with three levels of the between-subjects grouping factor and four levels of the within-subjects factor. The results show that: (1) the violation of the sphericity assumption did not affect KR robustness when the assumption of normality was not fulfilled; (2) the robustness of the KR procedure decreased as skewness in the distributions increased, there being no strong effect of kurtosis; and (3) the type of pairing between kurtosis and group size was shown to be a relevant variable to consider when using this procedure, especially when pairing is positive (i.e., when the largest group is associated with the largest value of the kurtosis coefficient and the smallest group with its smallest value). The KR procedure can be a good option for analysing repeated-measures data when the groups have different distributions, provided the total sample sizes are 45 or larger and the data are not highly or extremely skewed.",,"REPEATED-MEASURES DESIGNS,SPLIT-PLOT DESIGNS,LONGITUDINAL DATA,MONTE-CARLO,ROBUSTNESS,SKEWNESS,ANOVA,VARIANCE,KURTOSIS,VIOLENCE","Arnau, Jaume@Univ Barcelona, Dept Methodol Behav Sci, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain::Bendayan, Rebecca@Univ Malaga, Dept Psychobiol & Methodol Behav Sci, E-29071 Malaga, Spain::Blanca, Maria J.@Univ Malaga, Dept Psychobiol & Methodol Behav Sci, E-29071 Malaga, Spain::Bono, Roser@Univ Barcelona, Dept Methodol Behav Sci, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain","Arnau, Jaume@University of Barcelona::Bendayan, Rebecca@Universidad de Malaga::Blanca, Maria J.@Universidad de Malaga::Bono, Roser@University of Barcelona",not exist,"no title+Alnosaier, WS.+Kenward-Roger Approximate F Test for Fixed Effects in Mixed Linear Models+2007::Analyzing Small Samples of Repeated Measures Data with the Mixed-Model Adjusted F Test+Arnau, Jaime; Bono, Roser; Vallejo, Guillermo+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2009::Effect of the violation of normality and sphericity in the linear mixed model in split-plot designs+Arnau, Jaime; Bendayan, Rebecca; Blanca, Maria J.; et al.+PSICOTHEMA+AUG 2012::The effect of skewness and kurtosis on the robustness of linear mixed models+Arnau, Jaume; Bendayan, Rebecca; Blanca, Maria J.; et al.+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS+SEP 2013::Using the linear mixed model to analyze nonnormal data distributions in longitudinal designs+Arnau, Jaume; Bono, Roser; Blanca, Mara J.; et al.+BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS+DEC 2012::Subgroup analysis and other (mis)uses of baseline data in clinical trials+Assmann, SF; Pocock, SJ; Enos, LE; et al.+LANCET+MAR 25 2000::Comparison of the procedures of Fleishman and Ramberg et al. for generating non-normal data in simulation studies+Bendayan, Rebecca; Arnau, Jaime; Blanca, Maria J.; et al.+ANALES DE PSICOLOGIA+JAN 2014::Skewness and Kurtosis in Real Data Samples+Blanca, Maria J.; Arnau, Jaume; Lopez-Montiel, Dolores; et al.+METHODOLOGY-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RESEARCH METHODS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES+2013::Using linear mixed models in longitudinal studies: Application of SAS PROC MIXED+Bono, R.; Arnau, J.; Balluerka, N.+Revista Electronica de Metodologia Aplicada+2007::ROBUSTNESS+BRADLEY, JV+BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL &amp; STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1978::The effect of skewness and kurtosis on the one-sample &lt;IT&gt;t&lt;/IT&gt;test and the impact of knowledge of the population standard deviation+Chaffin, W.

On the asymptotic standard error of a class of robust estimators of ability in dichotomous item response models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12027,NOV 2014,32,2,"In item response theory, the classical estimators of ability are highly sensitive to response disturbances and can return strongly biased estimates of the true underlying ability level. Robust methods were introduced to lessen the impact of such aberrant responses on the estimation process. The computation of asymptotic (i.e., large-sample) standard errors (ASE) for these robust estimators, however, has not yet been fully considered. This paper focuses on a broad class of robust ability estimators, defined by an appropriate selection of the weight function and the residual measure, for which the ASE is derived from the theory of estimating equations. The maximum likelihood (ML) and the robust estimators, together with their estimated ASEs, are then compared in a simulation study by generating random guessing disturbances. It is concluded that both the estimators and their ASE perform similarly in the absence of random guessing, while the robust estimator and its estimated ASE are less biased and outperform their ML counterparts in the presence of random guessing with large impact on the item response process.",,"PERSON-FIT STATISTICS,LATENT ABILITY,PERFORMANCE","Magis, David@Univ Liege, Dept Educ, B-4000 Liege, Belgium@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium","Magis, David@KU Leuven@University of Liege",not exist,"Some latent trait models and their use in inferring an examinee's ability+Birnbaum,, A.+Statistical theories of mental test scores+1968::ON ROBUSTNESS IN THE LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODEL+CARROLL, RJ; PEDERSON, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1993::THIN VERSUS THICK MATCHING IN THE MANTEL-HAENSZEL PROCEDURE FOR DETECTING DIF+DONOGHUE, JR; ALLEN, NL+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+SUM 1993::no title+Hambleton,, R.

Statistical mediation analysis with a multicategorical independent variable,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12028,NOV 2014,54,594,"Virtually all discussions and applications of statistical mediation analysis have been based on the condition that the independent variable is dichotomous or continuous, even though investigators frequently are interested in testing mediation hypotheses involving a multicategorical independent variable (such as two or more experimental conditions relative to a control group). We provide a tutorial illustrating an approach to estimation of and inference about direct, indirect, and total effects in statistical mediation analysis with a multicategorical independent variable. The approach is mathematically equivalent to analysis of (co) variance and reproduces the observed and adjusted group means while also generating effects having simple interpretations.

Model selection for minimum-diameter partitioning,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12029,NOV 2014,64,3,"The minimum-diameter partitioning problem (MDPP) seeks to produce compact clusters, as measured by an overall goodness-of-fit measure known as the partition diameter, which represents the maximum dissimilarity between any two objects placed in the same cluster. Complete-linkage hierarchical clustering is perhaps the best-known heuristic method for the MDPP and has an extensive history of applications in psychological research. Unfortunately, this method has several inherent shortcomings that impede the model selection process, such as: (1) sensitivity to the input order of the objects, (2) failure to obtain a globally optimal minimum-diameter partition when cutting the tree at K clusters, and (3) the propensity for a large number of alternative minimum-diameter partitions for a given K. We propose that each of these problems can be addressed by applying an algorithm that finds all of the minimum-diameter partitions for different values of K. Model selection is then facilitated by considering, for each value of K, the reduction in the partition diameter, the number of alternative optima, and the partition agreement among the alternative optima. Using five examples from the empirical literature, we show the practical value of the proposed process for facilitating model selection for the MDPP.",,"CLUSTER-ANALYSIS,CONFUSION MATRICES,STRUCTURAL BALANCE,SEXUAL HARASSMENT,SIMILARITY,CLASSIFICATION,RECOGNITION,DIMENSIONS,JUDGMENTS,STIMULUS","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Steinley, Douglas@Univ Missouri Columbia, Columbia, MO USA","Brusco, Michael J.@Florida State University@State University System of Florida::Steinley, Douglas@University of Missouri Columbia@University of Missouri System",not exist,"The Irises of the Gaspe Peninsula+Anderson, E.+Bull.

Comparing score tests and other local dependence diagnostics for the graded response model,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12030,NOV 2014,29,6,"Score tests for identifying locally dependent item pairs have been proposed for binary item response models. In this article, both the bifactor and the threshold shift score tests are generalized to the graded response model. For the bifactor test, the generalization is straightforward; it adds one secondary dimension associated only with one pair of items. For the threshold shift test, however, multiple generalizations are possible: in particular, conditional, uniform, and linear shift tests are discussed in this article. Simulation studies show that all of the score tests have accurate Type I error rates given large enough samples, although their small-sample behaviour is not as good as that of Pearson's Chi(2) and M-2 as proposed in other studies for the purpose of local dependence (LD) detection. All score tests have the highest power to detect the LD which is consistent with their parametric form, and in this case they are uniformly more powerful than Chi(2) and M-2; even wrongly specified score tests are more powerful than Chi(2) and M-2 in most conditions.

A latent class distance association model for cross-classified data with a categorical response variable,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12038,NOV 2014,29,1,"In this paper we propose a latent class distance association model for clustering in the predictor space of large contingency tables with a categorical response variable. The rows of such a table are characterized as profiles of a set of explanatory variables, while the columns represent a single outcome variable. In many cases such tables are sparse, with many zero entries, which makes traditional models problematic. By clustering the row profiles into a few specific classes and representing these together with the categories of the response variable in a low-dimensional Euclidean space using a distance association model, a parsimonious prediction model can be obtained. A generalized EM algorithm is proposed to estimate the model parameters and the adjusted Bayesian information criterion statistic is employed to test the number of mixture components and the dimensionality of the representation. An empirical example highlighting the advantages of the new approach and comparing it with traditional approaches is presented.",,"PREFERENCE RATING DATA,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,CRITERIA","Fernando Vera, Jose@Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain::de Rooij, Mark@Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands::Heiser, Willem J.@Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Fernando Vera, Jose@University of Granada::de Rooij, Mark@Leiden University::Heiser, Willem J.@Leiden University","De Rooij, Mark@C-7047-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7308-6210","no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2013::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION OF THE RC(M) ASSOCIATION MODEL+BECKER, MP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1990::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD IN 3-WAY CONTINGENCY-TABLES+BIRCH, MW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1963::ORTHOGONAL ROTATION TO CONGRUENCE+CLIFF, N+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1966::Graphical representations and odds ratios in a distance-association model for the analysis of cross-classified data+De Rooij, M; Heiser, WJ+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2005::The distance perspective of generalized biadditive models: Scalings and transformations+de Rooij, Mark+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2007::The analysis of change, Newton's law of gravity and association models+de Rooij, Mark+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2008::Ideal Point Discriminant Analysis Revisited with a Special Emphasis on Visualization+de Rooij, Mark+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2009::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Cluster Differences Unfolding for Two-Way Two-Mode Preference Rating Data+Fernando Vera, J.; Macias, Rodrigo; Heiser, Willem J.+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+OCT 2013::A Latent Class Multidimensional Scaling Model for Two-Way One-Mode Continuous Rating Dissimilarity Data+Fernando Vera, J.; Macias, Rodrigo; Heiser, Willem J.+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 2009::CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING WHETHER CERTAIN CATEGORIES IN A CROSS-CLASSIFICATION TABLE SHOULD BE COMBINED, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORIES IN AN OCCUPATIONAL-MOBILITY TABLE+GOODMAN, LA+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY+1981::THE ANALYSIS OF CROSS-CLASSIFIED DATA HAVING ORDERED AND OR UNORDERED CATEGORIES - ASSOCIATION MODELS, CORRELATION MODELS, AND ASYMMETRY MODELS FOR CONTINGENCY-TABLES WITH OR WITHOUT MISSING ENTRIES+GOODMAN, LA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1985::A SIMPLIFIED MONTE CARLO SIGNIFICANCE TEST PROCEDURE+HOPE, ACA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1968::On collapsing categories in two-way contingency tables+Kateri, M; Iliopoulos, G+STATISTICS+SEP-OCT 2003::no title+McLachlan, G.; Peel, D.+Finite mixture models+2000::STOCHASTIC COMPLEXITY AND MODELING+RISSANEN, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1986::MODELING BY SHORTEST DATA DESCRIPTION+RISSANEN, J+AUTOMATICA+1978::no title+Rissanen, J.+Stochastic complexity in statistical inquiry+1989::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::A cautionary note on likelihood ratio tests in mixture models+Seidel, W; Mosler, K; Alker, M+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 2000::Visualization in ideal point discriminant analysis+Takane, Y.+Visualization of categorical data+1998::On likelihood ratio tests for dimensionality selection+Takane, Y.; Browne, M.

Dual imputation model for incomplete longitudinal data,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12021,MAY 2014,41,2,"Missing values are a practical issue in the analysis of longitudinal data. Multiple imputation (MI) is a well-known likelihood-based method that has optimal properties in terms of efficiency and consistency if the imputation model is correctly specified. Doubly robust (DR) weighing-based methods protect against misspecification bias if one of the models, but not necessarily both, for the data or the mechanism leading to missing data is correct. We propose a new imputation method that captures the simplicity of MI and protection from the DR method. This method integrates MI and DR to protect against misspecification of the imputation model under a missing at random assumption. Our method avoids analytical complications of missing data particularly in multivariate settings, and is easy to implement in standard statistical packages. Moreover, the proposed method works very well with an intermittent pattern of missingness when other DR methods can not be used. Simulation experiments show that the proposed approach achieves improved performance when one of the models is correct. The method is applied to data from the fireworks disaster study, a randomized clinical trial comparing therapies in disaster-exposed children. We conclude that the new method increases the robustness of imputations.","propensity score,double protection,non-monotone missing data,ignorable missingness","FULLY CONDITIONAL SPECIFICATION,DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATORS,MULTIPLE IMPUTATION,MISSING DATA,PROPENSITY PREDICTION,NONRESPONSE MODELS,PENALIZED SPLINE,DROP-OUT,INFERENCE","Jolani, Shahab@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands::Frank, Laurence E.@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands::van Buuren, Stef@Univ Utrecht, Dept Methodol & Stat, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands@TNO, Dept Stat, Leiden, Netherlands","Jolani, Shahab@Utrecht University::Frank, Laurence E.@Utrecht University::van Buuren, Stef@Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research@Utrecht University","Frank, Laurence E.@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4075-8129","Robust model-based inference for incomplete data via penalized spline propensity prediction+An, Hyonggin; Little, Roderick J.

Evaluating clinical significance: Incorporating robust statistics with normative comparison tests,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12015,MAY 2014,29,2,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate a modified test of equivalence for conducting normative comparisons when distribution shapes are non-normal and variances are unequal. A Monte Carlo study was used to compare the empirical Type I error rates and power of the proposed Schuirmann-Yuen test of equivalence, which utilizes trimmed means, with that of the previously recommended Schuirmann and Schuirmann-Welch tests of equivalence when the assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity are satisfied, as well as when they are not satisfied. The empirical Type I error rates of the Schuirmann-Yuen were much closer to the nominal alpha level than those of the Schuirmann or Schuirmann-Welch tests, and the power of the Schuirmann-Yuen was substantially greater than that of the Schuirmann or Schuirmann-Welch tests when distributions were skewed or outliers were present. The Schuirmann-Yuen test is recommended for assessing clinical significance with normative comparisons.",,"POPULATION VARIANCES,TRIMMED MEANS,EQUIVALENCE","van Wieringen, Katrina@York Univ, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada::Cribbie, Robert A.@York Univ, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","van Wieringen, Katrina@York University - Canada::Cribbie, Robert A.@York University - Canada",not exist,"Evaluating clinical significance through equivalence testing: Extending the normative comparisons approach+Cribbie, Robert A.; Arpin-Cribbie, Chantal A.+PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH+2009::AN EXTENSION OF WELCHS APPROXIMATE T-SOLUTION TO COMPARATIVE BIOEQUIVALENCE TRIALS+DANNENBERG, O; DETTE, H; MUNK, A+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1994::The Expanding Role of Quantitative Methodologists in Advancing Psychology+Golinski, Caroline; Cribbie, Robert A.+CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGY-PSYCHOLOGIE CANADIENNE+MAY 2009::The effects of heteroscedasticity on tests of equivalence+Gruman, J.

A note on statistical power in multi-site randomized trials with multiple treatments at each site,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12016,MAY 2014,17,1,"We derive the statistical power functions in multi-site randomized trials with multiple treatments at each site, using multi-level modelling. An F statistic is used to test multiple parameters in the multi-level model instead of the Wald chi square test as suggested in the current literature. The F statistic is shown to be more conservative than the Wald statistic in testing any overall treatment effect among the multiple study conditions. In addition, we improvise an easy way to estimate the non-centrality parameters for the means comparison t-tests and the F test, using Helmert contrast coding in the multi-level model. The variance of treatment means, which is difficult to fathom but necessary for power analysis, is decomposed into intuitive simple effect sizes in the contrast tests. The method is exemplified by a multi-site evaluation study of the behavioural interventions for cannabis dependence.",,"SIZE,DESIGN","Liu, Xiaofeng Steven@Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Liu, Xiaofeng Steven@University of South Carolina System@University of South Carolina@University of South Carolina Columbia",not exist,"Therapist effects in three treatments for alcohol problems+Allen, JP; Mattson, ME; Miller, WR; et al.+PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH+WIN 1998::Brief treatments for cannabis dependence: Findings from a randomized multisite trial+Babor, TF; Carroll, K; Christiansen, K; et al.+JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY+JUN 2004::Standardized or simple effect size: What should be reported?+Baguley, Thom+BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY+AUG 2009::Facilitating Outpatient Treatment Entry Following Detoxification for Injection Drug Use: A Multisite Test of Three Interventions+Campbell, Barbara K.; Fuller, Bret E.; Lee, Eun Sul; et al.+PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS+JUN 2009::no title+Goldstein, H.+Multilevel Statistical Models+2011::no title+Hox, J.+MULTILEVEL ANAL TECH+2010::no title+Johnson, N.

The amount of misfit in an application of a Bayesian version of the model to two subtests of the SON-R 512-17 is investigated by means of item fit statistics in the framework of posterior predictive checks and by means of a comparison with a model that allows for residual (co)variance in the item parameters.

On the limitations of fixed-step-size adaptive methods with response confidence,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12018,MAY 2014,27,3,"The family of (non-parametric, fixed-step-size) adaptive methods, also known as 'up-down' or 'staircase' methods, has been used extensively in psychophysical studies for threshold estimation. Extensions of adaptive methods to non-binary responses have also been proposed. An example is the three-category weighted up-down (WUD) method (Kaernbach, 2001) and its four-category extension (Klein, 2001). Such an extension, however, is somewhat restricted, and in this paper we discuss its limitations. To facilitate the discussion, we characterize the extension of WUD by an algorithm that incorporates response confidence into a family of adaptive methods. This algorithm can also be applied to two other adaptive methods, namely Derman's up-down method and the biased-coin design, which are suitable for estimating any threshold quantiles. We then discuss via simulations of the above three methods the limitations of the algorithm. To illustrate, we conduct a small scale of experiment using the extended WUD under different response confidence formats to evaluate the consistency of threshold estimation.",,"PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTION,SIGNAL-DETECTION,CHOICE,TIME,DISTRIBUTIONS,TASKS","Hsu, Yung-Fong@Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Psychol, Taipei 10617, Taiwan::Chin, Ching-Lan@Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Psychol, Taipei 10617, Taiwan","Hsu, Yung-Fong@National Taiwan University::Chin, Ching-Lan@National Taiwan University","HSU, YUNG-FONG@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5193-9718","Milliplex (TM) MAP multiplex immunoassays for simultaneous detection of human and mouse cytokines/chemokines+Chen, Yao; Proctor, Brandon; Mistry, Jehangir; et al.+CYTOKINE+OCT-NOV 2010::NON-PARAMETRIC UP-AND-DOWN EXPERIMENTATION+DERMAN, C+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1957::A METHOD FOR OBTAINING AND ANALYZING SENSITIVITY DATA+DIXON, WJ; MOOD, AM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1948::Recasting (the near-miss to) Weber's law+Doble, CW; Falmagne, JC; Berg, BG+PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW+APR 2003::Up-and-down designs .1.

Stochastic search item selection for factor analytic models,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,10.1111/bmsp.12019,MAY 2014,32,2,In this paper we implement a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic search variable selection method of George and McCulloch (1993) for identifying promising subsets of manifest variables (items) for factor analysis models. The suggested algorithm is constructed by embedding in the usual factor analysis model a normal mixture prior for the model loadings with latent indicators used to identify not only which manifest variables should be included in the model but also how each manifest variable is associated with each factor. We further extend the suggested algorithm to allow for factor selection. We also develop a detailed procedure for the specification of the prior parameters values based on the practical significance of factor loadings using ideas from the original work of George and McCulloch (1993). A straightforward Gibbs sampler is used to simulate from the joint posterior distribution of all unknown parameters and the subset of variables with the highest posterior probability is selected. The proposed method is illustrated using real and simulated data sets.,"Stochastic Search Variable Selection,factor selection,Markov Chain Monte Carlo,Gibbs sampling,Prior Specification","VARIABLE-SELECTION,BAYES","Mavridis, Dimitris@Univ Ioannina, Dept Primary Educ, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece@Univ Ioannina, Sch Med, Dept Hyg & Epidemiol, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece::Ntzoufras, Ioannis@Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens, Greece","Mavridis, Dimitris@University of Ioannina::Ntzoufras, Ioannis@Athens University of Economics & Business",not exist,"Bayesian dynamic factor models and portfolio allocation+Aguilar, O; West, M+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2000::Bayesian factor analysis with fat-tailed factors and its exact marginal likelihood+Ando, Tomohiro+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+SEP 2009::no title+Arbuckle,, J.
