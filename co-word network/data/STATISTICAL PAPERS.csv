An analysis of quantile measures of kurtosis: center and tails,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0101-4,JUN 2009,20,3,"The consequences of substituting the denominator Q (3)(p) - Q (1)(p) by Q (2) - Q (1)(p) in Groeneveld's class of quantile measures of kurtosis (gamma (2)(p)) for symmetric distributions, are explored using the symmetric influence function. The relationship between the measure gamma (2)(p) and the alternative class of kurtosis measures kappa(2)(p) is derived together with the relationship between their influence functions.

A unified approach of testing for discrete and continuous Pareto laws,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0103-2,JUN 2009,10,3,"New tests are proposed for the Pareto distribution as well as its discrete version, the so called Zipf's law. In both cases the discrepancy between the empirical moment of arbitrary negative order and its theoretical counterpart is utilized in a weighted integral test statistic. If the weight function is of exponential rate of decay interesting limit statistics are obtained. The tests are shown to be consistent under fixed alternatives and a Monte Carlo study is drawn to investigate the performance of the proposed procedures in small samples. Furthermore a bootstrap procedure is proposed to cope with the case of unknown shape parameter.

Estimating a sensitive proportion through randomized response procedures based on auxiliary information,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0107-y,JUN 2009,22,22,"Randomized response techniques are widely employed in surveys dealing with sensitive questions to ensure interviewee anonymity and reduce nonrespondents rates and biased responses. Since Warner's (J Am Stat Assoc 60:63-69, 1965) pioneering work, many ingenious devices have been suggested to increase respondent's privacy protection and to better estimate the proportion of people, pi (A) , bearing a sensitive attribute. In spite of the massive use of auxiliary information in the estimation of non-sensitive parameters, very few attempts have been made to improve randomization strategy performance when auxiliary variables are available. Moving from Zaizai's (Model Assist Stat Appl 1:125-130, 2006) recent work, in this paper we provide a class of estimators for pi (A) , for a generic randomization scheme, when the mean of a supplementary non-sensitive variable is known.

We show that p = [d + 1/2] + 1 gives the smallest variances and mean squared errors. These properties depend also on the truncation parameter m. Moreover, we study the impact of the short-memory components on the bias and variances of these estimators.

The MLE and LRT can not be written in closed form. Therefore, a modification of the MLE using the technique suggested by Maharota and Nanda (Biometrika 61:601-606, 1974) will be considered and this modified estimator will be used to modify the LRT to get a test in closed form for testing a simple hypothesis against one sided alternatives. The same idea will be used to modify the most powerful test (MPT) for testing a simple hypothesis versus a simple hypothesis to get a test in closed form for testing a simple hypothesis against one sided alternatives. Then it appears that the modified estimator is a good competitor of the MLE and the modified tests are good competitors of the LRT using MERSS and simple random sampling (SRS).","Simple random sampling,Moving extreme ranked set sampling,Maximum likelihood estimator,Modified maximum likelihood estimator,Likelihood ratio test,Modified likelihood ratio test,Modified most powerful test,Exponential distribution",PARAMETER,"Abu-Dayyeh, Walid@Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Muscat, Oman::Al Sawi, Esam@King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Math & Stat, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia","Abu-Dayyeh, Walid@Sultan Qaboos University::Al Sawi, Esam@King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals",not exist,"A variation of ranked set sampling+Al-Odat, M.; Al-Saleh, M.

In the simplest case ARMA(1,1), by using the factorization theorem, we present a sufficient statistic whose dimension depends on the sample size and this dimension is even larger than the sample size. In this case and under some restrictions, we have solved this problem and have presented a sufficient statistic whose dimension does not depend on the sample size. In the general case, due to the complexity of the problem, we will use the modified versions of the likelihood function to find an approximate sufficient statistic in terms of the periodogram. The dimension of this sufficient statistic depends on the sample size; however, this dimension is much lower than the sample size.","Multivariate ARMA,Sufficient statistic,Approximate sufficient statistic",,"Kharrati-Kopaei, M.@Shiraz Univ, Dept Stat, Coll Sci, Shiraz 71454, Iran::Nematollahi, A.

Preliminary phi-divergence test estimators for linear restrictions in a logistic regression model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0078-z,MAR 2009,18,5,The problem of estimation of the parameters in a logistic regression model is considered under multicollinearity situation when it is suspected that the parameter of the logistic regression model may be restricted to a subspace. We study the properties of the preliminary test based on the minimum phi-divergence estimator as well as in the phi-divergence test statistic.

Non-parametric estimation of lifetime distribution of competing risk models when censoring times are missing,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0086-z,MAR 2009,12,1,"There are situations in the analysis of failure time or lifetime data where the censoring times of unfailed units are missing. The non-parametric estimator of the lifetime distribution for such data is available in literature. In this paper we consider an extension of this situation to the univariate and bivariate competing risk setups. The maximum likelihood and simple moment estimators of cause specific distribution functions in both univariate and bivariate situations are developed. A simulation study is carried out to assess the performance of the estimators. Finally, we illustrate the method with real data set.","Competing risk models,Incomplete data,Maximum likelihood estimate,Moment estimate,Non-parametric estimation",,"Sankaran, P.

Regression modelling of the flows in an input-output table with accounting constraints,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0061-8,MAR 2009,13,2,"This paper details a method for estimating the unknown parameters of a regression model when the estimates of the dependent variable should be embedded in an input-output table with accounting constraints. Since in regression modelling the dependent variable is usually transformed either to achieve homoscedasticity of the residuals or for a better interpretation of the model, the estimating procedure becomes an optimization problem of an opportunely defined Lagrangian function with non-linear constraints. After detailing the algorithm and deriving the asymptotic distribution of the restricted estimator, the methodology is applied to estimate the flows of tourism within and between Italian regions with a gravity model. The procedure can be seen as an extension of Byron's (J R Stat Soc Ser A 141:359-367, 1978) balancing method.","Input-output table,Gravity model,Non-linear constraints,Restricted estimators,Social accounting matrix,Tourist flows","SUBJECT,ERROR","Falocci, Nicola@Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Econ Stat & Finanza, I-06100 Perugia, Italy@Serv Consiglio Reg Umbria, Perugia, Italy::Paniccia, Renato@Ist Reg Programmaz Econ Toscana, Florence, Italy::Stanghellini, Elena@Unknow","Falocci, Nicola@University of Perugia::Paniccia, Renato@Unknow::Stanghellini, Elena@Unknow",not exist,"MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS SUBJECT TO RESTRAINTS+AITCHISON, J; SILVEY, SD+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1958::no title+Anselin,, L.+Spatial econometrics: methods and models+1988::ESTIMATION OF LARGE SOCIAL ACCOUNT MATRICES+BYRON, RP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1978::no title+Fomby, B.; Hill, R.

Our simulation study indicates that the one-at-a-time reference prior performs better than other reference priors in terms of matching the target coverage probabilities in a frequentist sense.","Frequentist coverage probability,Probability matching priors,Ratio of variances,Reference priors","PROBABILITY MATCHING PRIORS,FREQUENTIST VALIDITY,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,PARAMETER","Kim, D.

This control chart is a nonparametric chart based on the Mann-Whitney statistic for a change in mean and adapted for repeated sequential use. We do not require any knowledge of the underlying distribution such as the normal assumption. Particularly, this distribution robustness could be a significant advantage in start-up or short-run situations where we usually do not have knowledge of the underlying distribution. The simulated results show that our approach has a good performance across the range of possible shifts and it can be used during the start-up stages of the process.","Nonparametric methods,Change-point model,Mann-Whitney statistic,Average run length,Estimated control limits,EWMA chart","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,SEQUENTIAL DETECTION,CUSUM PROCEDURE,(X)OVER-BAR,VARIANCE,SHIFTS,LIMITS,RANKS","Zhou, Chunguang@Nankai Univ, Dept Stat, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Zou, Changliang@Nankai Univ, Dept Stat, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Zhang, Yujuan@Nankai Univ, Dept Stat, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Wang, Zhaojun@Nankai Univ, Dept Stat, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China","Zhou, Chunguang@Nankai University::Zou, Changliang@Nankai University::Zhang, Yujuan@Nankai University::Wang, Zhaojun@Nankai University",not exist,"NONPARAMETRIC PROCEDURE FOR PROCESS-CONTROL BASED ON WITHIN-GROUP RANKING+BAKIR, ST; REYNOLDS, MR+TECHNOMETRICS+1979::no title+Chakraborti, S.; van de Wiel, M.

Robust estimation of multivariate regression model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0063-6,JAN 2009,18,3,This paper studies robust estimation of multivariate regression model using kernel weighted local linear regression. A robust estimation procedure is proposed for estimating the regression function and its partial derivatives. The proposed estimators are jointly asymptotically normal and attain nonparametric optimal convergence rate. One-step approximations to the robust estimators are introduced to reduce computational burden. The one-step local M-estimators are shown to achieve the same efficiency as the fully iterative local M-estimators as long as the initial estimators are good enough. The proposed estimators inherit the excellent edge-effect behavior of the local polynomial methods in the univariate case and at the same time overcome the disadvantages of the local least-squares based smoothers. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed estimators. Real data sets are analyzed to illustrate the practical utility of the proposed methodology.,"Local M-estimator,Local polynomial regression,Multivariate regression model,One-step,Robustness","BANDWIDTH,SMOOTHERS,LOCATION","Li, Jiantao@Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China::Zheng, Min@Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Li, Jiantao@Peking University::Zheng, Min@Peking University",not exist,"no title+Bellman, R.+Adaptive Control Processes: A Guided Tour+1961::no title+Belsley, David A.; Kuh, Edwin; Welsch, Roy E.+Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity+1980::ESTIMATING OPTIMAL TRANSFORMATIONS FOR MULTIPLE-REGRESSION AND CORRELATION+BREIMAN, L; FRIEDMAN, JH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::ASYMPTOTICS FOR M-TYPE SMOOTHING SPLINES+COX, DD+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1983::LOCAL LINEAR-REGRESSION SMOOTHERS AND THEIR MINIMAX EFFICIENCIES+FAN, JQ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1993::VARIABLE BANDWIDTH AND LOCAL LINEAR-REGRESSION SMOOTHERS+FAN, JQ; GIJBELS, I+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1992::no title+Gijbels, I.; Fan, J.+Local polynomial modeling and its applications.+1996::ROBUST NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION WITH SIMULTANEOUS SCALE CURVE ESTIMATION+HARDLE, W; TSYBAKOV, AB+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1988::HEDONIC HOUSING PRICES AND DEMAND FOR CLEAN-AIR+HARRISON, D; RUBINFELD, DL+JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT+1978::no title+Huber, PJ.+Robust statistics+1981::ROBUST M-ESTIMATORS OF MULTIVARIATE LOCATION AND SCATTER+MARONNA, RA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1976::no title+Mason, R.L.; Gunst, R.F.; Hess, J.L.+Statistical Design and Analysis of Experiments: Applications to Engineering and Science+1989::A fully automated bandwidth selection method for fitting additive models+Opsomer, JD; Ruppert, D+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1998::no title+OPSOMER JD+THESIS CORNELL U+1995::Robust estimation of multivariate location and shape+Rocke, DM; Woodruff, DL+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1 1997::no title+WAND, M.

On MSE of EBLUP,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0066-3,JAN 2009,16,8,"We consider Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs) and Empirical Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (EBLUPs) under the general mixed linear model. The BLUP was proposed by Henderson (Ann Math Stat 21:309-310, 1950). The formula of this BLUP includes unknown elements of the variance-covariance matrix of random variables. If the elements in the formula of the BLUP proposed by Henderson (Ann Math Stat 21:309-310, 1950) are replaced by some type of estimators, we obtain the two-stage predictor called the EBLUP which is model- unbiased (Kackar and Harville in Commun Stat A 10:1249-1261, 1981). Kackar and Harville (J Am Stat Assoc 79:853-862, 1984) show an approximation of the mean square error (the MSE) of the predictor and propose an estimator of the MSE. The MSE and estimators of the MSE are also studied by Prasad and Rao (J Am Stat Assoc 85:163-171, 1990), Datta and Lahiri (Stat Sin 10:613-627, 2000) and Das et al. (Ann Stat 32(2):818-840, 2004). In the paper we consider the BLUP proposed by Royall (J Am Stat Assoc 71:657-473, 1976, Zadlo (On unbiasedness of some EBLU predictor. Physica-Verlag, Heidelberg, pp 2019-2026, 2004) shows that the BLUP proposed by Royall (J Am Stat Assoc 71:657-473, 1976) may be treated as a generalisation of the BLUP proposed by Henderson (Ann Math Stat 21:309-310, 1950) and proves model unbiasedness of the EBLUP based on the formula of the BLUP proposed by Royall (J Am Stat Assoc 71:657-473, 1976) under some assumptions. In this paper we derive the formula of the approximate MSE of the EBLUP and its estimators. We prove that the approximation of the MSE is accurate to terms 0(D(-1)) and that the estimator of the MSE is approximately unbiased in the sense that its bias is 0(D(-1)) under some assumptions, where D is the number of domains. The proof is based on the results obtained by Datta and Lahiri (Stat Sin 10:613-627, 2000). Using our results we show some EBLUP based on the special case of the general linear model. We also present the formula of its MSE and estimators of its MSE and their performance in Monte Carlo simulation study.","Model approach in survey sampling,General linear model,General mixed linear model,BLUP and EBLUP","MEAN SQUARED ERROR,MIXED LINEAR-MODELS,PREDICTION,ESTIMATORS","Zadlo, Tomasz@Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat, PL-40226 Katowice, Poland","Zadlo, Tomasz@University of Economics in Katowice","Zadlo, Tomasz@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0638-0748","Mean squared error of empirical predictor+Das, K; Jiang, JM; Rao, JNK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::A unified measure of uncertainty of estimated best linear unbiased predictors in small area estimation problems+Datta, GS; Lahiri, P+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2000::no title+Fuller, W.+INTRO STAT TIME SERI+1976::MEAN SQUARED ERROR OF ESTIMATION OR PREDICTION UNDER A GENERAL LINEAR-MODEL+HARVILLE, DA; JESKE, DR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1992::ESTIMATION OF GENETIC PARAMETERS+HENDERSON, CR+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1950::UNBIASEDNESS OF 2-STAGE ESTIMATION AND PREDICTION PROCEDURES FOR MIXED LINEAR-MODELS+KACKAR, RN; HARVILLE, DA+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1981::APPROXIMATIONS FOR STANDARD ERRORS OF ESTIMATORS OF FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECTS IN MIXED LINEAR-MODELS+KACKAR, RN; HARVILLE, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1984::THE ESTIMATION OF THE MEAN SQUARED ERROR OF SMALL-AREA ESTIMATORS+PRASAD, NGN; RAO, JNK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1990::no title+no author+R: a language and environment for statistical computing+2005::no title+Rao, J.

Weibull inference using trimmed samples and prior information,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0067-2,JAN 2009,27,18,"Trimmed samples are commonly used in several branches of statistical methodology, especially when the presence of contaminated data is suspected. Assuming that certain proportions of the smallest and largest observations from a Weibull sample are unknown or have been eliminated, a Bayesian approach to point and interval estimation of the scale parameter, as well as hypothesis testing and prediction, is presented. In many cases, the use of substantial prior information can significantly increase the quality of the inferences and reduce the amount of testing required. Some Bayes estimators and predictors are derived in closed-forms. Highest posterior density estimators and credibility intervals can be computed using iterative methods. Bayes rules for testing one-and two-sided hypotheses are also provided. An illustrative numerical example is included.","Bayesian estimation,testing and prediction,HPD estimator and interval,Reliability function,Order statistics","BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION,LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS,UNKNOWN SCALE,RELIABILITY,PARAMETERS,MODEL","Fernandez, Arturo J.@Univ La Laguna, Fac Matemat, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, San Cristobal la Laguna 38271, Spain","Fernandez, Arturo J.@Universidad de la Laguna","Fernandez, Arturo@I-2177-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2646-0905","no title+Abernethy, R.

Accuracy of approximate progressively censored reliability sampling plans for exponential models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0048-5,JAN 2009,18,18,"Reliability sampling plans provide an efficient method to determine the acceptability of a product based upon the lifelengths of some test units. Usually, they depend on the producer and consumer's quality requirements and do not admit closed form solutions. Acceptance sampling plans for one-and two-parameter exponential lifetime models, derived by approximating the operating characteristic curve, are presented in this paper. The accuracy of these approximate plans, which are explicitly expressible and valid for failure and progressive censoring, is assessed. The approximation proposed in the one-parameter case is found to be practically exact. Explicit lower and upper bounds on the smallest sample size are given in the two-parameter case. Some additional advantages are also pointed out.","Acceptance sampling plans,Acceptable and rejectable quality levels,Progressive type II censoring,Operating characteristic curve","2-PARAMETER WEIBULL,DISTRIBUTIONS,PARAMETERS,LIFE","Perez-Gonzalez, Carlos J.@Univ La Laguna, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Tenerife 38271, Spain::Fernandez, Arturo J.@Univ La Laguna, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Tenerife 38271, Spain","Perez-Gonzalez, Carlos J.@Universidad de la Laguna::Fernandez, Arturo J.@Universidad de la Laguna","Fernandez, Arturo@I-2177-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2646-0905::Perez-Gonzalez, Carlos@L-2880-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0059-7161","no title+BALAKRISHNAN N+TEST IN PRESS+2007::Progressively censored reliability sampling plans for the Weibull distribution+Balasooriya, U; Saw, SLC; Gadag, V+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2000::PROGRESSIVELY CENSORED SAMPLES IN LIFE TESTING+COHEN, AC+TECHNOMETRICS+1963::TRUNCATED LIFE TESTS IN THE EXPONENTIAL CASE+EPSTEIN, B+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1954::LIFE TESTING+EPSTEIN, B; SOBEL, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1953::Computing maximum likelihood estimates from Type II doubly censored exponential data+Fernandez, A.J.; Bravo, J.I.; De Fuentes, I.+Statistical Methods &amp; Applications+2002::Progressively censored variables sampling plans for two-parameter exponential distributions+Fernandez, AJ+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+OCT 2005::On estimating exponential parameters with general type II progressive censoring+Fernandez, AJ+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1 2004::LIFE-TEST SAMPLING PLANS FOR 2-PARAMETER WEIBULL POPULATIONS+FERTIG, KW; MANN, NR+TECHNOMETRICS+1980::Exact non-parametric confidence intervals for quantiles with progressive type-II censoring+Guilbaud, O+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2001::SAMPLING PLANS FOR INSPECTION BY VARIABLES+LIEBERMAN, GJ; RESNIKOFF, GJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1955::BEST LINEAR INVARIANT ESTIMATION FOR WEIBULL PARAMETERS UNDER PROGRESSIVE CENSORING+MANN, NR+TECHNOMETRICS+1971::THE NON-CENTRAL CHI-2-DISTRIBUTION AND F-DISTRIBUTION AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+PATNAIK, PB+BIOMETRIKA+1949::FAILURE-CENSORED VARIABLES-SAMPLING PLANS FOR LOGNORMAL AND WEIBULL-DISTRIBUTIONS+SCHNEIDER, H+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1989::LINEAR ORDER STATISTIC ESTIMATION FOR 2-PARAMETER WEIBULL AND EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM TYPE-II PROGRESSIVELY CENSORED SAMPLES+THOMAS, DR; WILSON, WM+TECHNOMETRICS+1972::INTERVAL ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS OF LIFE FROM PROGRESSIVELY CENSORED-DATA+VIVEROS, R; BALAKRISHNAN, N+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1994::The distribution of chi square+Wilson, EB; Hilferty, MM+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+1931::Failure-censored sampling plan for theWeibull distribution+Wu, J.-W.; Tsai, W.-L.+International Journal of Information and Management Sciences+2000"

In the cases discussed here these are due to the use of density functions that have singularities. These singularities are naturally inherited by the profile likelihood function. It is therefore apparently important to be reminded that likelihood functions are proportional to probability functions, and so cannot have singularities. When this issue is addressed, then the profile likelihood poses no problems of this sort.

Factor analysis regression,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0036-1,OCT 2008,26,6,"In the presence of multicollinearity the literature points to principal component regression (PCR) as an estimation method for the regression coefficients of a multiple regression model. Due to ambiguities in the interpretation, involved by the orthogonal transformation of the set of explanatory variables, the method could not yet gain wide acceptance. Factor analysis regression (FAR) provides a model-based estimation method which is particularly tailored to overcome multicollinearity in an errors-in-variables setting. In this paper two feasible versions of a FAR estimator are compared with the OLS estimator and the PCR estimator by means of Monte Carlo simulation. While the PCR estimator performs best in cases of strong and high multicollinearity, the Thomson-based FAR estimator proves to be superior when the regressors are moderately correlated.","factor analysis regression (FAR),principal component regression (PCR),multicollinearity,errors-in-variables model",,"Kosfeld, Reinhold@Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, D-34117 Kassel, Germany::Lauridsen, Jorgen@Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark","Kosfeld, Reinhold@Universitat Kassel::Lauridsen, Jorgen@University of Southern Denmark","Lauridsen, Jorgen T.@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9889-6236","no title+Albert, A.+Regression and the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse+1972::no title+AMEMIYA T+ADV ECNOMETRICS+1985::no title+ANDERSON TW+3RD P BERK S MATH ST+1956::no title+Bartholomew, D.

State space mixed models for longitudinal observations with binary and binomial responses,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0039-y,OCT 2008,34,11,"We propose a new class of state space models for longitudinal discrete response data where the observation equation is specified in an additive form involving both deterministic and random linear predictors. These models allow us to explicitly address the effects of trend, seasonal or other time-varying covariates while preserving the power of state space models in modeling serial dependence in the data. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to carry out statistical inference for models with binary and binomial responses, in which we invoke de Jong and Shephard's (Biometrika 82(2):339-350, 1995) simulation smoother to establish an efficient sampling procedure for the state variables. To quantify and control the sensitivity of posteriors on the priors of variance parameters, we add a signal-to-noise ratio type parameter in the specification of these priors. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed state space mixed models for longitudinal binomial response data in both simulation studies and data examples.","longitudinal data,Markov chain Monte Carlo,probit,random effects,regression,seasonality,signal-to-noise ratio","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,TIME-SERIES MODELS,MONTE-CARLO,PRIORS,SIMULATION,COUNTS","Czado, Claudia@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math Sci, D-85747 Garching, Germany::Song, Peter X. -K.@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Czado, Claudia@Technical University of Munich::Song, Peter X. -K.@University of Waterloo","Czado, Claudia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6329-5438","Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::no title+Brockwell, P.

Quadratic subspaces and construction of Bayes invariant quadratic estimators of variance components in mixed linear models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0021-8,JUL 2008,19,0,"Gnot et al. (J Statist Plann Inference 30(1):223-236, 1992) have presented the formulae for computing Bayes invariant quadratic estimators of variance components in normal mixed linear models of the form N{gamma, X beta, Sigma(k)(i=1) sigma V-2(i)i} where the matrices V-i , 1 <= i <= k - 1, are symmetric and nonnegative definite and V-k is an identity matrix. These formulae involve a basis of a quadratic subspace containing MV1 M,...,MVk-1M,M, where M is an orthogonal projector on the null space of X'. In the paper we discuss methods of construction of such a basis. We survey Malley's algorithms for finding the smallest quadratic subspace including a given set of symmetric matrices of the same order and propose some modifications of these algorithms. We also consider a class of matrices sharing some of the symmetries common to MV1M,...,MV Mk-1,M. We show that the matrices from this class constitute a quadratic subspace and describe its explicit basis, which can be directly used for computing Bayes invariant quadratic estimators of variance components. This basis can be also used for improving the efficiency of Malley's algorithms when applied to finding a basis of the smallest quadratic subspace containing the matrices MV1M,...,MVk-1M,M. Finally, we present the results of a numerical experiment which confirm the potential usefulness of the proposed methods.","quadratic subspace of symmetric matrices,Jordan algebra,mixed linear model",,"Grzadziel, Mariusz@Agr Univ Wroclaw, Dept Math, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland","Grzadziel, Mariusz@Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences",not exist,"Introduction to the GiNaC framework for symbolic computation within the C++ programming language+Bauer, C; Frink, A; Kreckel, R+JOURNAL OF SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION+JAN 2002::BAYES INVARIANT QUADRATIC ESTIMATION IN GENERAL LINEAR-REGRESSION MODELS+GNOT, S; SRZEDNICKA, J; ZMYSLONY, R+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1992::no title+Khuri, A.

Furthermore, the resulting GMM estimator is analyzed in a Monte-Carlo simulation and compared with alternative estimators.","generalized method of moments,probit model,endogenous regressor","INCONSISTENCY,EXOGENEITY,LOGIT","Wilde, Joachim@Halle Inst Econ Res, D-06108 Halle, Germany","Wilde, Joachim@Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH)",not exist,"MULTIPERIOD PROBIT MODELS AND ORTHOGONALITY CONDITION ESTIMATION+AVERY, RB; HANSEN, LP; HOTZ, VJ+INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW+1983::Simultaneous microeconometric models with censored or qualitative dependent variables+Blundell, R.

A non-stationary integer-valued autoregressive model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0028-1,JUL 2008,28,28,"It is frequent to encounter a time series of counts which are small in value and show a trend having relatively large fluctuation. To handle such a non-stationary integer-valued time series with a large dispersion, we introduce a new process called integer-valued autoregressive process of order p with signed binomial thinning (INARS(p)). This INARS(p) uniquely exists and is stationary under the same stationary condition as in the AR(p) process. We provide the properties of the INARS(p) as well as the asymptotic normality of the estimates of the model parameters. This new process includes previous integer-valued autoregressive processes as special cases. To preserve integer-valued nature of the INARS(p) and to avoid difficulty in deriving the distributional properties of the forecasts, we propose a bootstrap approach for deriving forecasts and confidence intervals. We apply the INARS(p) to the frequency of new patients diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S. during the period of 108 months from January 1993 to December 2001.","non-stationarity,integer-valued time series,signed binomial thinning,bootstrapping,over-dispersion,quasi-likelihood","BOOTSTRAP PREDICTION INTERVALS,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,MOVING-AVERAGE PROCESSES,TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS,POISSON REGRESSION,DISEASE","Kim, Hee-Young@Korea Univ, Inst Stat, Seoul 136701, South Korea::Park, Yousung@Korea Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 136701, South Korea","Kim, Hee-Young@Korea University::Park, Yousung@Korea University",not exist,"First order integer valued autoregressive (INAR(l)) process+Al-Osh, M.

Comparisons of the r-k class estimator to the ordinary least squares estimator under the Pitman's closeness criterion,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0029-0,JUL 2008,10,7,"In the presence of multicollinearity, the r - k class estimator is proposed as an alternative to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator which is a general estimator including the ordinary ridge regression (ORR), the principal components regression (PCR) and the OLS estimators. Comparison of competing estimators of a parameter in the sense of mean square error (MSE) criterion is of central interest. An alternative criterion to the MSE criterion is the Pitman's (1937) closeness (PC) criterion. In this paper, we compare the r - k class estimator to the OLS estimator in terms of PC criterion so that we can get the comparison of the ORR estimator to the OLS estimator under the PC criterion which was done by Mason et al. (1990) and also the comparison of the PCR estimator to the OLS estimator by means of the PC criterion which was done by Lin and Wei (2002).","multicollinearity,Pitman closeness criterion,r - k class estimator,ordinary ridge regression estimator,principal components regression estimator","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT REGRESSION,COMBINING RIDGE","Ozkale, M.

A family of shrinkage estimators for Weibull shape parameter in censored sampling,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0030-7,JUL 2008,55,4,"In this paper a new class of shrinkage estimators has been introduced for the shape parameter in an independently identically distributed two-parameterWeibull model under censored sampling. The main idea is to incorporate the prior guessed value by correcting the standard estimator, which is essentially an unbiased estimator, with optimally weighted ratios of the guessed value and the standard estimator, instead of considering a convex combination of the standard estimator and the difference of the guessed value and the standard estimator. The resulting estimator dominates the standard estimator in a surprisingly large neighborhood of the guessed value. The suggested estimator has also been compared with the minimum mean squared error estimator and a class of estimators suggested by Singh and Shukla in IAPQR Trans 25(2), 107-118, 2000. It is found that the suggested class of estimators has lesser bias as well as lesser mean squared error than its competitors subject to certain conditions.","Weibull distribution,shape parameter,guessed value,progressive type II censoring,bias,mean squared error,percent relative efficiency","EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTION,RELIABILITY FUNCTION,EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION,SHRUNKEN ESTIMATORS,BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION,SCALE PARAMETER,EMPIRICAL BAYES,EXPERT OPINION,INTERVAL,DISTRIBUTIONS","Singh, Housila Prasad@Vikram Univ, Sch Studies Stat, Ujjain 456010, Madhya Pradesh, India::Saxena, Sharad@Nirma Univ, Inst Management, Ahmadabad 382481, Gujarat, India::Joshi, Harshada@Vikram Univ, Sch Studies Stat, Ujjain 456010, Madhya Pradesh, India","Singh, Housila Prasad@Vikram University::Saxena, Sharad@Nirma University::Joshi, Harshada@Vikram University",not exist,"APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN ESTIMATES FOR THE WEIBULL RELIABILITY FUNCTION AND HAZARD RATE FROM CENSORED-DATA+ABDELWAHID, AA; WINTERBOTTOM, A+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1987::INFERENCES BASED ON CENSORED SAMPLING FROM WEIBULL OR EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTION+BAIN, LJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1972::no title+BENNETT GK+THOERY APPL RELIABIL+1977::A PERFORMANCE COMPARISON OF EMPIRICAL BAYES AND BAYES ESTIMATORS OF THE WEIBULL AND GAMMA-SCALE PARAMETERS+CANAVOS, GC+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+1983::no title+CHIANG YJ+INT J MATER PROD TEC+2004::A NEW EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATOR WITH TYPE-II CENSORED-DATA+DEY, DK; KUO, L+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 1991::SIMPLE ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS OF WEIBULL OR EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTION+ENGELHARDT, M+TECHNOMETRICS+1975::SOME RESULTS ON POINT ESTIMATION FOR TWO-PARAMETER WEIBULL OR EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTION+ENGELHARDT, M; BAIN, LJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::SOME COMPLETE AND CENSORED SAMPLING RESULTS FOR WEIBULL OR EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTION+ENGELHARDT, M; BAIN, LJ+TECHNOMETRICS+1973::NEW PRACTICAL BAYES ESTIMATORS FOR THE 2-PARAMETER WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION+ERTO, P+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+1982::Discussion on application of the Weibull distribution to electrical breakdown of insulating materials+Fabiani, D; Simoni, L+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DIELECTRICS AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION+FEB 2005::Reliability tests for Weibull distribution with varying shape-parameter, based on complete data+Hisada, K; Arizino, I+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+SEP 2002::A CLASS OF SHRINKAGE ESTIMATORS FOR THE SCALE PARAMETER OF THE EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION+JANI, PN+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+APR 1991::no title+Johnson, N.

Modelling count data with overdispersion and spatial effects,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0031-6,JUL 2008,27,41,"In this paper we consider regression models for count data allowing for overdispersion in a Bayesian framework. We account for unobserved heterogeneity in the data in two ways. On the one hand, we consider more flexible models than a common Poisson model allowing for overdispersion in different ways. In particular, the negative binomial and the generalized Poisson (GP) distribution are addressed where overdispersion is modelled by an additional model parameter. Further, zero-inflated models in which overdispersion is assumed to be caused by an excessive number of zeros are discussed. On the other hand, extra spatial variability in the data is taken into account by adding correlated spatial random effects to the models. This approach allows for an underlying spatial dependency structure which is modelled using a conditional autoregressive prior based on Pettitt et al. in Stat Comput 12(4):353-367, (2002). In an application the presented models are used to analyse the number of invasive meningococcal disease cases in Germany in the year 2004. Models are compared according to the deviance information criterion (DIC) suggested by Spiegelhalter et al. in J R Stat Soc B64(4):583-640, (2002) and using proper scoring rules, see for example Gneiting and Raftery in Technical Report no. 463, University of Washington, (2004). We observe a rather high degree of overdispersion in the data which is captured best by the GP model when spatial effects are neglected. While the addition of spatial effects to the models allowing for overdispersion gives no or only little improvement, spatial Poisson models with spatially correlated or uncorrelated random effects are to be preferred over all other models according to the considered criteria.","Bayesian inference,count data,overdispersion,spatial regression models,zero inflated models","POISSON DISTRIBUTION,BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS","Gschloessl, Susanne@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math Sci, D-85747 Garching, Germany::Czado, Claudia@Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Math Sci, D-85747 Garching, Germany","Gschloessl, Susanne@Technical University of Munich::Czado, Claudia@Technical University of Munich","Czado, Claudia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6329-5438","Zero-inflated models with application to spatial count data+Agarwal, DK; Gelfand, AE; Citron-Pousty, S+ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS+DEC 2002::A Bayesian analysis of zero-inflated generalized Poisson model+Angers, JF; Biswas, A+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 28 2003::no title+Banerjee, Sudipto; Carlin, Bradley P; Gelfand, Alan E.+Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data+2004::On conditional and intrinsic autoregressions+Besag, J; Kooperberg, C+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::Verification of forecasts expressed in terms of probability+Brier, G.

The accuracy of normal approximation in a heterogeneous panel data unit root test,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0033-4,JUL 2008,12,2,"Tests for unit roots in panel data have become very popular. Two attractive features of panel data unit root tests are the increased power compared to time-series tests, and the often well-behaved limiting distributions of the tests. In this paper we apply Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well the normal approximation works for a heterogeneous panel data unit root test when there are only a few cross sections in the sample. We find that the normal approximation, which should be valid for large numbers of cross-sectional units, works well, at conventional significance levels, even when the number of cross sections is as small as two. This finding is valuable for the applied researcher since critical values will be easy to obtain and p-values will be readily available.","panel data,unit root,stationarity,simulation,small-sample inference","STATIONARITY,HYPOTHESIS,FINITE","Jonsson, Kristian@Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden","Jonsson, Kristian@Lund University",not exist,"Purchasing power parity during currency crises: A panel unit root test under structural breaks+Breitung, J; Candelon, B+REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS+2005::Unit roots and cointegration in panels+Breitung, J; Pesaran, MH.+CAMBRIDGE WORKING PA+2005::Testing for stationarity in heterogeneous panel data+Hadri, K.+Econ J+2000::Testing for stationarity in heterogeneous panel data where the time dimension is finite+Hadri, K; Larsson, R+ECONOMETRICS JOURNAL+2005::Testing for unit roots in heterogeneous panels+Im, KS; Pesaran, MH; Shin, Y+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 2003::no title+IM KS+UNPUB TESTING UNIT R+1997::TESTING THE NULL HYPOTHESIS OF STATIONARITY AGAINST THE ALTERNATIVE OF A UNIT-ROOT - HOW SURE ARE WE THAT ECONOMIC TIME-SERIES HAVE A UNIT-ROOT+KWIATKOWSKI, D; PHILLIPS, PCB; SCHMIDT, P; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT-DEC 1992::Unit root tests in panel data: new results+Levin, A; Lin, C-F.+Discussion paper 93-56+1993::Unit Root Tests in Panel Data: Asymptotic and Finite Sample Properties+LEVIN, A.; LINN, C.

A note on testing for nonstationarity in autoregressive processes with level dependent conditional heteroskedasticity,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0035-2,JUL 2008,20,3,"In this paper, we investigate the empirical distribution and the statistical properties of maximum likelihood (ML) unit-root t-statistics computed from data sampled from a first-order autoregressive (AR) process with level-dependent conditional heteroskedasticity (LDCH). This issue is of particular importance for applications on interest rate time-series. Unfortunately, the extent of the technical complexity related associated to LDCH patterns does not offer a feasible theoretical analysis, and there is no formal knowledge about the finite-sample size and power behaviour or the ML test for this context. Our analysis provides valuable guidelines for applied work and directions for future work.","maximum likelihood estimation,nonstationarity,volatility,interest rates","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATORS,TERM INTEREST-RATE,UNIT-ROOT TESTS,TIME-SERIES,INTEREST-RATES,MODELS,ERRORS","Rodrigues, Paulo M.

Sampling design proportional to order statistic of auxiliary variable,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0012-9,APR 2008,15,0,"The sampling designs dependent on sample moments of auxiliary variables are well known. Lahiri (Bull Int Stat Inst 33:133-140, 1951) considered a sampling design proportionate to a sample mean of an auxiliary variable. Sing and Srivastava (Biometrika 67(1):205-209, 1980) proposed the sampling design proportionate to a sample variance while Wywial (J Indian Stat Assoc 37:73-8, 1999) a sampling design proportionate to a sample generalized variance of auxiliary variables. Some other sampling designs dependent on moments of an auxiliary variable were considered e. g. in Wywial (Some contributions to multivariate methods in, survey sampling. Katowice University of Economics, Katowice, 2003a); Stat Transit 4(5):779-798, 2000) where accuracy of some sampling strategies were compared, too. These sampling designs cannot be useful in the case when there are some censored observations of the auxiliary variable. Moreover, they can be much too sensitive to outliers observations. In these cases the sampling design proportionate to the order statistic of an auxiliary variable can be more useful. That is why such an unequal probability sampling design is proposed here. Its particular cases as well as its conditional version are considered, too. The sampling scheme implementing this sampling design is proposed. The inclusion probabilities of the first and second orders were evaluated. The well known Horvitz-Thompson estimator is taken into account. A ratio estimator dependent on an order statistic is constructed. It is similar to the well known ratio estimator based on the population and sample means. Moreover, it is an unbiased estimator of the population mean when the sample is drawn according to the proposed sampling design dependent on the appropriate order statistic.","sampling design,order statistic,sample quantile,auxiliary variable,Horvitz-Thompson statistic,ratio estimator,inclusion probabilities,sampling scheme",ESTIMATORS,"Wywial, Janusz L.@Katowice Univ Econ, Dept Stat, PL-40226 Katowice, Poland","Wywial, Janusz L.@University of Economics in Katowice",not exist,"no title+Fisz, M.+Probability theory and mathematical statistics+1963::The inverse hypergeometric-a useful model+Guenther, W.

Homogeneity testing in a Weibull mixture model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0015-6,APR 2008,28,8,"The mixed Weibull distribution provides a flexible model to analyze random durations in a possibly heterogeneous population. To test for homogeneity against unobserved heterogeneity in a Weibull mixture model, a dispersion score test and a goodness-of-fit test are investigated. The empirical power of these tests is assessed and compared on a broad range of alternatives. It comes out that the dispersion score test, as it is based on a Weibull-to-exponential transformation, often breaks down. A simple new procedure is introduced for Weibull mixtures in scale, which combines the dispersion score test and the goodness-of-fit test. The new test is compared with several known procedures and shown to have a good overall power. To detect mixtures in shape and scale, a goodness-of-fit test is recommended.","mixture diagnosis,survival analysis,hazard models,dispersion score test,goodness-of-fit,Weibull-to-exponential transform","LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS,SHAPE PARAMETER,DISTRIBUTIONS","Mosler, Karl@Univ Cologne, Seminar Wirschafts & Sozialstat, D-50923 Cologne, Germany::Scheicher, Christoph@Univ Cologne, Seminar Wirschafts & Sozialstat, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Mosler, Karl@University of Cologne::Scheicher, Christoph@University of Cologne",not exist,"no title+ABERNETHY RB+NEW WEIBULL HDB+1996::APPLICATIONS OF THE EM ALGORITHM TO THE ANALYSIS OF LIFE LENGTH DATA+ALBERT, JRG; BAXTER, LA+APPLIED STATISTICS-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C+1995::no title+Andersen, PK; Borgan, O; Gill, RD<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Keiding, N</span>.+Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes+1993::Testing homogeneity in a mixture distribution via the L-2 distance between competing models+Charnigo, R; Sun, JY+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2004::A modified likelihood ratio test for homogeneity in finite mixture models+Chen, HF; Chen, JH; Kalbfleisch, JD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::ESTIMATION OF MIXED WEIBULL PARAMETERS IN LIFE TESTING+CHENG, SW; FU, JC+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+1982::Score test of homogeneity for survival data.+Commenges, D; Andersen, P K+Lifetime data analysis+1995::no title+DAGOSTINO RB+GOODNESS OF FIT TECH+1986::ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS IN COMPOUND WEIBULL DISTRIBUTIONS+FALLS, LW+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::Alternative forms of the score test for heterogeneity in a censored exponential model+Jaggia, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 1997::MODELING FAILURE-DATA BY MIXTURE OF 2 WEIBULL-DISTRIBUTIONS - A GRAPHICAL APPROACH+JIANG, R; MURTHY, DNP+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+SEP 1995::A graphical estimation of mixed Weibull parameters in life testing electron tube+Kao, J.H.K.+Technometrics+1959::EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS TO DERIVE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES FOR FINITE EXPONENTIAL AND WEIBULL MIXTURES+KAYLAN, AR; HARRIS, CM+COMPUTERS &amp; OPERATIONS RESEARCH+1981::A study of the effects of mis-specification of the Weibull shape parameter on confidence bounds based on the Weibull-to-exponential transformation+Keats, JB; Nahar, PC; Korbel, KM+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+JAN-FEB 2000::no title+LANCASTER T+EC ANAL TRANSITION D+1990::no title+Lindsay, B.+Mixture models: Theory, Geometry and Applications+1995::no title+MARIN JM+STAT ECONOMETRICS SE+no time::Testing for homogeneity in an exponential mixture model+Mosler, K; Seidel, W+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+JUN 2001::no title+NEYMAN J+B I INT STAT+1966::A cautionary note on likelihood ratio tests in mixture models+Seidel, W; Mosler, K; Alker, M+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 2000::Likelihood ratio tests based on subglobal optimization: A power comparison in exponential mixture models+Seidel, W; Mosler, K; Alker, M+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JAN 2000::ON MIXTURES FROM EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES+SHAKED, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1980::no title+Shorack, G.; Wellner, J.+Empirical Processes with Applications in Statistics+1986::no title+Sinha, S.

HPD estimates are obtained in closed forms for complete or right censored data. In the general multiple censoring case, it is shown the existence and uniqueness of the estimates. Explicit lower and upper bounds are also provided. Due to the posterior unimodality, HPD credibility regions are simply connected sets.

Posterior analysis of lognormal regression models using the Gibbs sampler,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0372-1,JAN 2008,23,9,"The Gibbs sampler technique has been found to be very useful for extracting samples from the complex posterior forms and the procedure is equally well applicable in the analysis of both the complete and the censored data. In this paper we consider the lognormal model, an important model considered in wide variety of problems, and assume that the regressor (or stress) variables affect the two parameters of the distribution in a number of ways. The resulting lognormal regression models are analyzed to explore completely the relevant posterior surfaces using the well-known Gibbs sampler algorithm. To clarify the details of implementation, real data analysis from accelerated testing is presented separately for each individual model. Lastly, we consider examining the issue of recommending an appropriate model for a given set of data using some of the recent tool-kits of Bayesian statistics. Results are once: again examined with the support of a real data based example.","lognormal regression model,Gibbs sampler,samplingimportance-resampling,predictive simulation,chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov discrepancy measures,posterior and fractional Bayes factors",BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS,"Upadhyay, S.

The efficacy of this method is examined by comparing the. conventional hypothesis-testing method via comprehensive simulations and empirical applications. The method recommended is a model-selection using the Bayesian information criterion and allowing for heteroscedasticity. Empirical results show that the first structural change of Japanese economic growth occurred in 1974Q2, which was detected in 1979Q4, and that the second structural change occurred in 1992Q2, which was detected in 1998Q1.

In many real life situations, specially in lifetime or reliability estimation, the parameter mu is known a priori to lie in an interval [alpha, infinity). This makes the usual maximum likelihod estimator (MLE) (X) over bar an inadmissible estimator of mu with respect to the squared error loss. This is due to the fact that it may take values outside the parameter space. Katz (1961) and Gupta and Rohatgi (1980) proposed estimators which lie completely in the given interval. In this paper, we derive some new estimators for mu and present a comparative study of the risk performance of these estimators. Both the known and unknown variance cases have been explored.

A practical sampling approach for a Bayesian mixture model with unknown number of components,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0361-4,OCT 2007,13,4,"Recently, mixture distribution becomes more and more popular in many scientific fields. Statistical computation and analysis of mixture models, however, are extremely complex due to the large number of parameters involved. Both EM algorithms for likelihood inference and MCMC procedures for Bayesian analysis have various difficulties in dealing with mixtures with unknown number of components. In this paper, we propose a direct sampling approach to the computation of Bayesian finite mixture models with varying number of components. This approach requires only the knowledge of the density function up to a multiplicative constant. It is easy to implement, numerically efficient and very practical in real applications. A simulation study shows that it performs quite satisfactorily on relatively high dimensional distributions. A well-known genetic data set is used to demonstrate the simplicity of this method and its power for the computation of high dimensional Bayesian mixture models.","direct Monte Carlo sampling,visualization,finite mixture distribution,genetic data analysis",,"Wang, Liqun@Univ Manitoba, Dept Stat, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada::Fu, James C.@Univ Manitoba, Dept Stat, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Wang, Liqun@University of Manitoba::Fu, James C.@University of Manitoba","Wang, Liqun@C-9398-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1869-9871","no title+BROOKS SP+J ROYAL STAT SOC B+2003::Nonparametric convergence assessment for MCMC model selection+Brooks, SP; Giudici, P; Philippe, A+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2003::Computational and inferential difficulties with mixture posterior distributions.+Celeux, G; Hurn, M; Robert, CP+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::no title+CHEN H+20012002 U WAT DEP S+2001::ASSESSING THE ROLE OF APNH, A GENE ENCODING FOR A HUMAN AMILORIDE-SENSITIVE NA+/H+ ANTIPORTER, ON THE INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN RED-CELL NA+/LI+ COUNTERTRANSPORT+DUDLEY, CRK; GIUFFRA, LA; RAINE, AEG; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY+OCT 1991::A random-discretization based Monte Carlo sampling method and its applications+Fu, J.C.; Liqun Wang+Methodology and Computing in Applied Probability+March 2002::Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo computation and Bayesian model determination+Green, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::Contributions to the mathematical theory of evolution.+Pearson, K.+Philosophical Transactions+1894::On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components+Richardson, S; Green, PJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1997::A GRAPHICAL TECHNIQUE FOR DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS IN A MIXTURE OF NORMALS+ROEDER, K+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1994::Bayesian analysis of mixture models with an unknown number of components - An alternative to reversible jump methods+Stephens, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2000::Dealing with label switching in mixture models+Stephens, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::no title+TITTERINGTON D+STAT ANAL FINITE MIX+1985"
Simulated classical tests in multinomial probit models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0362-3,OCT 2007,37,5,"This paper compares the application of different versions of the simulated counterparts of the Wald test, the score test, and the likelihood ratio test in one- and multiperiod multinomial probit models. Monte Carlo experiments show that the use of the simple form of the simulated likelihood ratio test delivers relatively robust results regarding the testing of several multinomial probit model specifications. In contrast, the inclusion of the Hessian matrix of the simulated loglikelihood function into the simulated score test and (in the multiperiod multinomial probit model) particularly the inclusion of the quasi-maximum likelihood theory into the simulated likelihood ratio test leads to substantial computational problems. The combined application of the quasi-maximum likelihood theory with the simulated Wald test or the simulated score test is not systematically superior to the application of the other versions of these two simulated classical tests either.

The first involves testing for the inclusion of a non-linear regressor and the second involves testing a linear regressor against the alternative of a non-linear regressor. We report the results of a Monte Carlo experiment that compares the size and power properties of the traditional LR tests with those of our proposed MIL based LR tests. Our simulation results show that in both cases, the MIL based tests have more accurate asymptotic critical values and better behaved (i.e., better centred) power curves than their classical counterparts.","likelihood ratio test,non-linear regression,Monte Carlo experiment,asymptotic critical value","REGRESSION DISTURBANCES,MARGINAL-LIKELIHOOD,COMPONENTS,PARAMETERS","Bhowmik, Jahar L.@Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia::King, Maxwell L.@Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Bhowmik, Jahar L.@Monash University::King, Maxwell L.@Monash University",not exist,"no title+Amemiya,, T.+Advanced Econometrics+1985::ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF CONDITIONAL MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATORS+ANDERSEN, EB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1970::no title+*APT SYST INC+GAUSS WIND NT 95 VER+1998::no title+ARA I+THESIS MONASH U CLAY+1995::no title+BELLHOUSE DR+SURVEY METHODOLOGY+1991::no title+BHOWMIK JL+2002 AUSTR M EC SOC+2002::no title+BHOWMIK JL+PARAMETER ESTIMATION+2005::no title+BREUSCH TS+COMMUNICATIONS STA A+1988::no title+CORDUAS M+THESIS U LANCASTER+1986::no title+COX, D.

Effect of neglected deterministic seasonality on unit root tests,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0343-6,JUL 2007,12,7,"Whenever deterministic seasonality is ignored, the distribution of the Dickey-Fuller test is shifted to the left, with lower dispersion at the same time. When accounting for serial correlation, the distortions become less predictable. A Monte Carlo study confirms that the (augmented) Dickey-Fuller test without seasonal dummies is oversized and has little power at the same time, due to the need of lag augmentation. The effect of neglecting seasonal deterministics on the KPSS test for stationarity depends on the way the long-run variance is estimated.","neglected seasonal means,Dickey-Fuller test,KPSS test","CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX,TIME-SERIES REGRESSION,HETEROSKEDASTICITY,MODELS","Demetrescu, Matei@Univ Frankfurt, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany::Hassler, Uwe@Univ Frankfurt, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany","Demetrescu, Matei@Goethe University Frankfurt::Hassler, Uwe@Goethe University Frankfurt","Demetrescu, Matei@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0815-5384","HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::UNIT ROOTS IN TIME-SERIES MODELS - TESTS AND IMPLICATIONS+DICKEY, DA; BELL, WR; MILLER, RB+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1986::DISTRIBUTION OF THE ESTIMATORS FOR AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES WITH A UNIT ROOT+DICKEY, DA; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1979::TESTING THE NULL HYPOTHESIS OF STATIONARITY AGAINST THE ALTERNATIVE OF A UNIT-ROOT - HOW SURE ARE WE THAT ECONOMIC TIME-SERIES HAVE A UNIT-ROOT+KWIATKOWSKI, D; PHILLIPS, PCB; SCHMIDT, P; et al.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT-DEC 1992::no title+LOPES AS+20021 CEMAPRE+2002::Critical Values for Co-integration Tests+MacKinnon, J.

2(m) 4(1) designs with minimum aberration or weak minimum aberration,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0328-5,APR 2007,25,4,"For measuring the goodness of 2(m)4(1) designs, Wu and Zhang (1993) proposed the minimum aberration (MA) criterion. MA 2(m)4(1) designs have been constructed using the idea of complementary designs when the number of two-level factors, m, exceeds n/2 where n is the total number of runs. In this paper, the structures of MA 2(m)4(1) designs are obtained when m > 5n/16 Based on these structures, some methods are developed for constructing MA 2(m)4(1) designs for 5n/16 < m < n/2 as well as for n/2 < m < n. When m <= 5n/16, there is no general method for constructing MA 2(m)4(1) designs. In this case, we obtain lower bounds for A(30) and A(31), where A(30) and A(31) are the numbers of type 0 and type 1 words with length three respectively. And a method for constructing weak minimum aberration (WMA) 2(m)4(1) designs (A(30) and A(31) achieving the lower bounds) is demonstrated. Some MA or WMA 2(m)4(1) designs with 32 or 64 runs are tabulated for practical use, which supplement the tables in Wu and Zhang (1993), Zhang and Shao (2001) and Mukerjee and Wu (2001).","minimum aberration,resolution,weak minimum aberration,wordlength pattern","FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,2(N-K) DESIGNS,2-LEVEL,RESOLUTION,CONSTRUCTION,SEARCH,TERMS","Li, Peng-Fei@Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Dept Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Liu, Min-Qian@Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Dept Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Zhang, Run-Chu@Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Dept Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Li, Peng-Fei@Nankai University@Nankai University@University of Waterloo::Liu, Min-Qian@Nankai University@Nankai University@University of Waterloo::Zhang, Run-Chu@Nankai University@Nankai University@University of Waterloo",not exist,"ORTHOGONAL MAIN-EFFECT PLANS FOR ASYMMETRICAL FACTORIAL EXPERIMENTS+ADDELMAN, S+TECHNOMETRICS+1962::MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF THE SYMMETRICAL FACTORIAL DESIGN+Bose, R.

Perfect aggregation of Bayesian analysis on compositional data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0330-y,APR 2007,17,7,"Sufficiency is a widely used concept for reducing the dimensionality of a data set. Collecting data for a sufficient statistic is generally much easier and less expensive than collecting all of the available data. When the posterior distributions of a quantity of interest given the aggregate and disaggregate data are identical, perfect aggregation is said to hold, and in this case the aggregate data is a sufficient statistic for the quantity of interest. In this paper, the conditions for perfect aggregation are shown to depend on the functional form of the prior distribution. When the quantity of interest is the sum of some parameters in a vector having either a generalized Dirichlet or a Liouville distribution for analyzing compositional data, necessary and sufficient conditions for perfect aggregation are also established.","Bayesian analysis,generalized Dirichlet distribution,Liouville distribution,perfect aggregation,sufficiency",GENERALIZED DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION,"Wong, Tzu-Tsung@Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Informat Management, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Wong, Tzu-Tsung@National Cheng Kung University",not exist,"no title+AZAIEZ MN+THESIS U WISCONSIN M+1993::Reciprocal spillover effects: A strategic benefit of brand extensions+Balachander, S; Ghose, S+JOURNAL OF MARKETING+JAN 2003::ON THE CONCEPT OF PERFECT AGGREGATION IN BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION+BIER, VM+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+1994::Learning and updating of uncertainty in Dirichlet models+Castillo, E; Hadi, AS; Solares, C+MACHINE LEARNING+JAN 1997::RESULTS CONCERNING BRAND CHOICE+CHATFIELD, C; GOODHART, G+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+1975::CONCEPTS OF INDEPENDENCE FOR PROPORTIONS WITH A GENERALIZATION OF DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION+CONNOR, RJ; MOSIMANN, JE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::no title+Fang, K.; Kotz, S.; Ng, K.+Symmetric Multivariate and Related Distributions+1990::no title+GUPTA AK+HDB BETA DISTRIBUTIO+2004::FUNDAMENTAL QUERIES IN AGGREGATION THEORY+IJIRI, Y+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::no title+Lee, PM.+Bayesian statistics: an introduction+1989::GENERALIZED DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION IN BAYESIAN LIFE TESTING+LOCHNER, RH+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1975::no title+MOSLEH A+RISK ANAL+1992::AGGREGATION OF VARIABLES IN DYNAMIC-SYSTEMS+SIMON, HA; ANDO, A+ECONOMETRICA+1961::ON A MULTIVARIATE EXTENSION OF THE GAMMA-DISTRIBUTIONS AND BETA-DISTRIBUTIONS+SIVAZLIAN, BD+SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS+1981::no title+Wilks, SS.+Mathematical Statistics+1962::Generalized Dirichlet distribution in Bayesian analysis+Wong, TT+APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION+DEC 15 1998::no title+Zacks, S.+Theory of Statistical Inference+1971"

Comparison of record data and random observations based on statistical evidence,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0313-z,JAN 2007,26,2,"""Science looks to Statistics for an objective measure of the strength of evidence in a given body of observations. The Law of Likelihood explains that the strength of statistical evidence for one hypothesis over another is measured by their likelihood ratio"" (Blume, 2002). In this paper, we compare probabilities of weak and strong misleading evidence based on record data with those based on the same number of iid observations from the original distribution. We shall also use a criterion defined as a combination of probabilities of weak and strong misleading evidence to do the above comparison. We also give numerical results of a simulated comparison.","record values,statistical evidence,extreme value distribution,Weibule distribution","ESTIMATING POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS,BREAKING OBSERVATIONS,FISHER INFORMATION,VALUES,TIMES,CONFIDENCE,INTERVALS","Emadi, M.@Ferdowsi Univ, Sch Math Sci, Dept Stat, Mashhad 91775, Iran::Ahmadi, J.@Ferdowsi Univ, Sch Math Sci, Dept Stat, Mashhad 91775, Iran::Arghami, N.

On the asymptotic bias of OLS in dynamic regression models with autocorrelated errors,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0317-8,JAN 2007,20,10,"It is well-known that Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) yields inconsistent estimates if applied to a regression equation with lagged dependent variables and correlated errors. Bias expressions which appear in the literature usually assume the exogenous.variables to be non-stochastic. Due to this assumiption the numerical sizes of there expressions cannot be determined. Further, the analysis is mostly restricted to, very simple models. In this paper the problem of calculating the asymptotic bias of OLS is generalized to stationary dynamic regression models, where the errors follow a stationary ARMA process., A, general bias expression is derived and a method is introduced by which its actual size can be computed numerically.",,"SMALL SAMPLE PROPERTIES,SERIAL-CORRELATION,DISTURBANCES,ESTIMATORS,TESTS","Stocker, Toni@Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ Math & Stat, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Stocker, Toni@University of Konstanz",not exist,"no title+Dhrymes, PJ.+Distributed Lags: Problems of Estimation and Formulation+1981::Small-sample properties of estimators of a regression equation with a lagged dependent variable and serial correlation+Flynn, B.

Risk comparison of the Stein-rule estimator in a linear regression model with omitted relevant regressors and multivariate t errors under the Pitman nearness criterion,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0321-z,JAN 2007,30,3,in this paper we consider a linear regression model with omitted relevant regressors and multivariate t error terms. The explicit formula for the Pitman nearness criterion of the Stein-rule (SR) estimator relative to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator is derived. It is shown numerically that the dominance of the SR estimator over the OLS estimator under the Pitman nearness criterion can be extended to the case of the multivariate t error distribution when the specification error is not severe. It is also shown that the dominance of the SR estimator over the OLS estimator cannot be extended to the case of the multivariate t error distribution when the specification error is severe.,,"SPHERICALLY SYMMETRICAL DISTURBANCES,PROXY VARIABLES,PERFORMANCE,VARIANCE,COEFFICIENTS,CLOSENESS,TERMS","Namba, Akio@Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan::Ohtani, Kazuhiro@Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan","Namba, Akio@Kobe University::Ohtani, Kazuhiro@Kobe University",not exist,"no title+BLATTBERG R+P BUSINESS+1974::no title+CHATURVEDI A+J QUANTITATIVE EC+1998::THE BEHAVIOR OF STOCK-MARKET PRICES+FAMA, EF+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+1965::ESTIMATION OF THE ERROR VARIANCE AFTER A PRELIMINARY-TEST OF HOMOGENEITY IN A REGRESSION-MODEL WITH SPHERICALLY SYMMETRICAL DISTURBANCES+GILES, JA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL-SEP 1992::Estimation with quadratic loss+James, W.; Stein, C.+P 4 BERK S MATH STAT+1961::no title+JUDGE G+ECONOMET THEOR+1985::JAMES-STEIN ESTIMATION FROM AN ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE+KEATING, JP; MASON, RL+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1988::no title+KEATING JP+J STAT COMPUT SIM+1989::RESTRICTED LEAST-SQUARES, PRE-TEST, OLS AND STEIN RULE ESTIMATORS - RISK COMPARISONS UNDER MODEL MISSPECIFICATION+MITTELHAMMER, RC+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1984::PMSE performance of the biased estimators in a linear regression model when relevant regressors are omitted+Namba, A+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+OCT 2002::MSE performance of the 2SHI estimator in a regression model with multivariate t error terms+Namba, A+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JAN 2001::MSE performance of the double k -class estimator of each individual regression coefficient under multivariate t -error+Namba, A.; Ohtani, K.+HDB APPL ECONOMETRIC+2002::A COMPARISON OF THE STEIN-RULE AND POSITIVE-PART STEIN-RULE ESTIMATORS IN A MISSPECIFIED LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL+OHTANI, K+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+DEC 1993::ON SMALL SAMPLE PROPERTIES OF R(2) IN A LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL WITH MULTIVARIATE-T ERRORS AND PROXY VARIABLES+OHTANI, K; HASEGAWA, H+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+SEP 1993::no title+OHTANI K+J QUANTITATIVE EC+1993::TESTING LINEAR RESTRICTIONS ON COEFFICIENTS IN A LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL WITH PROXY VARIABLES AND SPHERICALLY SYMMETRICAL DISTURBANCES+OHTANI, K; GILES, J+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY-JUN 1993::MES performance of the minimum mean squared error estimators in a linear regression model when relevant regressors are omitted+Ohtani, K+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1998::Small sample properties of the interval constrained least squares estimator when error terms have a multivariate t distribution+Ohtani, K.+Journal of the Japan Statistical Society+1991::Further improving the Stein-rule estimator using the Stein variance estimator in a misspecified linear regression model+Ohtani, K+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+SEP 2 1996::THE STRUCTURE OF SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION ESTIMATORS - A GENERALIZATION TOWARDS NONNORMAL DISTURBANCES+PRUCHA, IR; KELEJIAN, HH+ECONOMETRICA+1984::THE PITMAN NEARNESS CRITERION AND ITS DETERMINATION+RAO, CR; KEATING, JP; MASON, RL+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1986::THE STEIN PARADOX IN THE SENSE OF THE PITMAN MEASURE OF CLOSENESS+SEN, PK; KUBOKAWA, T; SALEH, AKME+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1989::James-Stein rule estimators in linear regression models with multivariate t distributed error+Singh, RS.+Aust J Stat+1991::ESTIMATION OF ERROR VARIANCE IN LINEAR-REGRESSION MODELS WITH ERRORS HAVING MULTIVARIATE STUDENT-TERT DISTRIBUTION WITH UNKNOWN DEGREES OF FREEDOM+SINGH, RS+ECONOMICS LETTERS+1988::PITMAN CLOSENESS FOR STEIN-RULE ESTIMATORS OF REGRESSION-COEFFICIENTS+SRIVASTAVA, AK; SRIVASTAVA, VK+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+SEP 22 1993::Inadmissibility of the usual es-timator for the mean of a multivariate normal distribution+Stein, Charles.+P 3 BERK S MATH STAT+1956::ESTIMATION OF THE PARAMETERS OF A REGRESSION-MODEL WITH A MULTIVARIATE-T ERROR VARIABLE+SUTRADHAR, BC; ALI, MM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1986::TESTING LINEAR-HYPOTHESIS WITH T ERROR VARIABLE+SUTRADHAR, BC+SANKHYA-THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS SERIES B+AUG 1988::ON THE ROBUSTNESS OF LM-TEST, LR-TEST, AND W-TEST IN REGRESSION-MODELS+ULLAH, A; ZINDEWALSH, V+ECONOMETRICA+1984::BAYESIAN AND NON-BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF REGRESSION-MODEL WITH MULTIVARIATE STUDENT-T ERROR TERMS+ZELLNER, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1976"

A comparison of Bayesian model selection based on MCMC with an application to GARCH-type models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0305-z,OCT 2006,33,9,"This paper presents a comprehensive review and comparison of five computational methods for Bayesian model selection, based on MCMC simulations from posterior model parameter distributions. We apply these methods to a well-known and important class of models in financial time series analysis, namely GARCH and GARCH-t models for conditional return distributions (assuming normal and t-distributions). We compare their performance with the more common maximum likelihood-based model selection for simulated and real market data. All five MCMC methods proved reliable in the simulation study, although differing in their computational demands. Results on simulated data also show that for large degrees of freedom (where the t-distribution becomes more similar to a normal one), Bayesian model selection results in better decisions in favor of the true model than maximum likelihood. Results on market data show the instability of the harmonic mean estimator and reliability of the advanced model selection methods.","Bayesian inference,Bayesian model selection,GARCH models,Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),model likelihood","MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD,MARKOV-CHAINS,ARCH MODELS,INFERENCE,OUTPUT","Miazhynskaia, Tatiana@Austrian Res Inst Artificial Intelligence, A-1010 Vienna, Austria@Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, Dept Med Cybernet & Artificial Intelligence, A-1010 Vienna, Austria::Dorffner, Georg@Austrian Res Inst Artificial Intelligence, A-1010 Vienna, Austria@Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, Dept Med Cybernet & Artificial Intelligence, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","Miazhynskaia, Tatiana@Unknow@Medical University of Vienna::Dorffner, Georg@Unknow@Medical University of Vienna",not exist,"Bayesian inference on GARCH models using Gibbs sampler+Bauwens, L.; Lubrano, M.+Econometrics Journal+1998::GENERALIZED AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY+BOLLERSLEV, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1986::no title+no author+HDB ECONOMETRICS+1994::no title+Carlin, B; Louis, T.+Bayes and empirical Bayes methods for data analysis+1996::Marginal likelihood from the Metropolis-Hastings output+Chib, S; Jeliazkov, I+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2001::Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output+Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Estimating Marginal Likelihoods for Mixture and Markov Switching Models Using Bridge Sampling Techniques+Fruhwirth-Schnatter, S.+The Econometrics Journal+2004::BAYESIAN MODEL DISCRIMINATION AND BAYES FACTORS FOR LINEAR GAUSSIAN STATE-SPACE MODELS+FRUHWIRTHSCHNATTER, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::SAMPLING-BASED APPROACHES TO CALCULATING MARGINAL DENSITIES+GELFAND, AE; SMITH, AFM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE - ASYMPTOTICS AND EXACT CALCULATIONS+GELFAND, AE; DEY, DK+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1994::Inference from iterative simulation using multiple sequences+Gelman, A; Rubin, DB.+Stat Sci+1992::Evaluating the accuracy of sampling-based approaches to the calculation of posterior moments+Geweke, J.+Bayesian statistics+1992::Bayesian treatment of the independent student t linear model+Geweke, J.+J Appl Econom+1993::no title+GEWEKE J+WORKING PAPERS FEDER+1995::Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo computation and Bayesian model determination+Green, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1995::MONTE-CARLO SAMPLING METHODS USING MARKOV CHAINS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS+HASTINGS, WK+BIOMETRIKA+1970::no title+Jeffreys, H.+Theory of probability+1961::BAYES FACTORS+KASS, RE; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::Bayesian analysis of switching ARCH models+Kaufmann, S; Fruhwirth-Schnatter, S+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+JUL 2002::Stochastic volatility: Likelihood inference and comparison with ARCH models+Kim, S; Shephard, N; Chib, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 1998::no title+KLEIBERGEN F+J APPL ECONOMET+1993::Bayes factors: What they are and what they are not+Lavine, M; Schervish, MJ+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1999::Simulating ratios of normalizing constants via a simple identity: A theoretical exploration+Meng, XL; Wong, WH+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 1996::no title+MIAZHYNSKAIA T+BAYESIAN TESTING NON+2004::Monte Carlo posterior integration in GARCH models+Muller, P.; Pole, A.+Sankhya, Series B+1998::Bayesian analysis of ARMA-GARCH models: A Markov chain sampling approach+Nakatsuma, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR 2000::Approximate Bayesian Inference by the Weighted Likelihood Bootstrap (with discussion)+Newton, M.; Raftery, A.+Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B+1994::How many iterations in the Gibbs Sampler?+Raftery, AE; Lewis, SM.+Bayesian Statistics+1992::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::Statistical Aspect of ARCH and Stochastic volatility+Shephard, N.+Time Series Models+1996::MARKOV-CHAINS FOR EXPLORING POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS+TIERNEY, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1994::Full Bayesian inference for GARCH and EGARCH models+Vrontos, ID; Dellaportas, P; Politis, DN+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 2000::no title+WASSERMAN L+BAYESIAN MODEL SELEC+1997"

Hotelling's T-2 control chart with double warning lines,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0307-x,OCT 2006,36,15,Recent studies have shown that the T-2 control chart with variable sampling intervals (VSI) and/or variable sample sizes (VSS) detects process shifts faster than the traditional T-2 chart. This article extends these studies for processes that are monitored with VSI and VSS using double warning lines (T-2 - DWL). it is assumed that the length of time the process remains in control has exponential distribution. The properties of T-2 - DWL chart are obtained using Markov chains.

EWNA charts for monitoring the mean and the autocovariances of stationary processes,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0308-9,OCT 2006,35,4,"In this paper various types of EWMA control charts are introduced for the simultaneous monitoring of the mean and the autocovariances. The target process is assumed to be a, stationary process up to fourth-order or an ARMA process with heavy tailed innovations. The case of a Gaussian process is included in our results as well.

The charts are compared within a simulation study. As a measure of the performance the average run length is taken. The target process is an ARMA(1,1) process with Student-t distributed innovations. The behavior of the charts is analyzed with respect to several out-of-control models. The best design parameters are determined for each chart. Our comparisons show that the multivariate EWMA chart applied to the residuals has the best overall performance.","statistical process control,EWMA charts,simultaneous control charts,time series analysis","STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,CUSUM CONTROL SCHEMES,AUTOCORRELATED PROCESSES,CORRELATED OBSERVATIONS,TIME-SERIES,VARIANCE","Rosolowski, M.@Europe Univ, Dept Stat, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany::Schmid, W.@Europe Univ, Dept Stat, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany","Rosolowski, M.@European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder::Schmid, W.@European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder",not exist,"TIME-SERIES MODELING FOR STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL+ALWAN, LC; ROBERTS, HV+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 1988::no title+ALWAN LC+THESIS GRADUATE SCH+1989::no title+Anderson, TW.+An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+1984::CONSISTENT AUTOREGRESSIVE SPECTRAL ESTIMATES+BERK, KN+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::no title+Brillinger, D.

The results of several theoretical comparisons of the performance of the estimators assuming a large sample size axe given. Also given is the comparison of the performance of the estimators using simulation when the sample size is small. These comparisons suggest that the estimator of choice is not the most ""natural"" estimator in this situation.

In this paper, Bayesian estimation for the two parameters of some life distributions, including Exponential, Weibull, Pareto and Burr type XII, are obtained based on upper record values. Prediction, either point or interval, for future upper record values is also presented from a Bayesian view point. Some of the non-Bayesian results can be achieved as limiting cases from our results.

The choice of time interval in seasonal adjustment: A heuristic approach,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0295-x,JUN 2006,20,0,"A typical problem of the seasonal adjustment procedures arises when the series to be adjusted is subject to structural breaks. In fact, using the full span of the series can result in a biased estimation of the ""true"" seasonally adjusted series, with unclear evidence showed by the usual diagnostic tests. In these cases the researcher has to decide where to cut-off the observed series to obtain a homogeneous span; this is generally performed by a simple visual inspection of the graph of the series and/or using a-priori information about the occurrence of the break. In this paper we propose a statistical criterion based on a distance measure between filters, evaluating its performance with Monte Carlo experiments.","linear filters,structural break,distance","SIGNAL EXTRACTION,STRUCTURAL-CHANGE,TESTS,PARAMETER,SERIES","Bruno, G@Univ Sassari, DEIR, I-70100 Sassari, Italy@ISAE, I-00185 Rome, Italy::Otranto, E@Univ Sassari, DEIR, I-70100 Sassari, Italy@ISAE, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Bruno, G@University of Sassari@Unknow::Otranto, E@University of Sassari@Unknow",not exist,"OPTIMAL TESTS WHEN A NUISANCE PARAMETER IS PRESENT ONLY UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE+ANDREWS, DWK; PLOBERGER, W+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1994::TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::no title+BACCHINI F+MODELLI COMPLESSI ME+2001::SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT BY SIGNAL EXTRACTION+BURMAN, JP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1980::TESTS OF EQUALITY BETWEEN SETS OF COEFFICIENTS IN 2 LINEAR REGRESSIONS+CHOW, GC+ECONOMETRICA+1960::no title+DAGUM EB+SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT+1988::no title+DEPOUTOT R+COMP SEASONAL ADJUST+1998::New capabilities and methods of the X-12-ARIMA seasonal-adjustment program+Findley, DF; Monsell, BC; Bell, WR; et al.+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1998::Large scale fitting of regression models with ARIMA errors+Fischer, B.; Planas, C.+Journal of Official Statistics+2000::no title+GHYSELS E+J ECONOMETRICS+1993::Is seasonal adjustment a linear or nonlinear data-filtering process?+Ghysels, E; Granger, CWJ; Siklos, PL+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1996::The effect of linear filters on dynamic time series with structural change+Ghysels, E; Perron, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 1996::Programs TRAMO (Time Series Regression with Arima Noise, Missing Observations, and Outliers) and SEATS (Signal Extraction in Arima Time Series): Instructions for the User+Gomez, Victor; Maravall, Agustin.+Working Paper 9628+1996::Unobserved components in economic time series+Maravall, A.+Macroeconomics+1995::Diagnostic checking ARMA time series models using squared-residual autocorrelations+McLeod, A.

Choosing the link function and accounting for link uncertainty in generalized linear models using Bayes factors,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0296-9,JUN 2006,38,13,"One important component of model selection using generalized linear models (GLM) is the choice of a link function. We propose using approximate Bayes factors to assess the improvement in fit over a GLM with canonical link when a parametric link family is used. The approximate Bayes factors are calculated using the Laplace approximations given in [32], together with a reference set of prior distributions. This methodology can be used to differentiate between different parametric link families, as well as allowing one to jointly select the link family and the independent variables. This involves comparing nonnested models and so standard significance tests cannot be used. The approach also accounts explicitly for uncertainty about the link function.

Estimating the term structure of interest rates using penalized splines,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-006-0297-8,JUN 2006,21,8,"We analyse the term structure of interest rates extracted from US Treasury STRIPS data. There is a potential interest from a scientific and economic point of view to look at short and long term bonds simultaneously. In terms of modelling this means to look at smooth functions over time describing the observed term structure. This is the approach pursued in this paper, where penalized spline fitting is employed as smoothing technique.. Smoothing is thereby carried out with the respect to both, calendar time and time left to maturity. While the first reveals long term trends, smoothing with respect to the time left to maturity can conceptionally be interpreted as interpolation. Since term structure models have implications for both, the time series and cross-section dimension of yields, estimation techniques involving both dimensions simultaneously are preferred over one-dimensional techniques. Numerical parsimony is applied to fit the large data set and smoothing parameter selection is pursued by building up parallels to linear mixed models.",,,"Krivobokova, T@Univ Bielefeld, Dept Econ, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany@Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany::Kauermann, G@Univ Bielefeld, Dept Econ, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany@Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany::Archontakis, T@Univ Bielefeld, Dept Econ, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany@Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany","Krivobokova, T@University of Bielefeld@Goethe University Frankfurt::Kauermann, G@University of Bielefeld@Goethe University Frankfurt::Archontakis, T@University of Bielefeld@Goethe University Frankfurt",not exist,"no title+BACKUS D+W6736 NBER+1998::no title+BRANDT M+W9458 NBER+2003::A NEW APPROACH TO ESTIMATION OF THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST-RATES+CHAMBERS, DR; CARLETON, WT; WALDMAN, DW+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS+1984::An empirical comparison of alternative models of the short term interest rate+Chan, K.C.; Karolyi, G.A.; Longstaff, F.A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Sanders, A.B</span>.+The Journal of Finance+1992::A THEORY OF THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST-RATES+COX, JC; INGERSOLL, JE; ROSS, SA+ECONOMETRICA+1985::no title+DIEBOLD F+W10048 NBER+2003::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD APPROACHES TO VARIANCE COMPONENT ESTIMATION AND TO RELATED PROBLEMS+HARVILLE, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::TERM STRUCTURE MOVEMENTS AND PRICING INTEREST-RATE CONTINGENT CLAIMS+HO, TSY; LEE, SB+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+DEC 1986::A comparison of yield curve estimation techniques using UK data+Ioannides, M+JOURNAL OF BANKING &amp; FINANCE+JAN 2003::Estimating the interest rate term structure of corporate debt with a semiparametric penalized spline model+Jarrow, R; Ruppert, D; Yu, Y+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2004::no title+JEFFREY A+FLEXIBLE TERM STRUCT+2001::no title+KRIVOBOKOVA T+SHORT NOTE PENALIZED+2004::no title+LINTON O+J ECONOMETRICS+2000::MEASURING TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES+MCCULLOCH, JH+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+1971::PARSIMONIOUS MODELING OF YIELD CURVES+NELSON, CR; SIEGEL, AF+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+OCT 1987::Nonparametric regression with correlated errors+Opsomer, J; Wang, YD; Yang, YH+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2001::no title+Ruppert, R.; Wand, M.; Carroll, R.+Semiparametric Regression+2003::MODELING THE DYNAMICS OF THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST-RATES+STEELEY, JM+ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW+JUL 1990::EQUILIBRIUM CHARACTERIZATION OF TERM STRUCTURE+VASICEK, O+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS+1977::Smoothing and mixed models+Wand, MP+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2003"

Recently, the Liu estimator which is an alternative biased estimator for beta has been proposed by Liu (1993). In this paper we introduce another new Liu type biased estimator called Stochastic restricted Liu estimator (beta) over cap (srd) for beta, and discuss its efficiency. The necessary and sufficient conditions for mean squared error matrix of the Stochastic restricted Liu estimator A. to exceed the mean squared error matrix of the mixed estimator (beta) over cap (m) will be derived for the two cases in which the parametric restrictions are correct and are not correct In particular we show that this new biased estimator is superior in the mean squared error matrix sense to both the Mixed estimator (beta) over cap (m) and to the biased estimator introduced by Liu (1993).","ordinary least squares estimator,mixed estimator,Liu estimator,stochastic restricted Liu estimator,mean squared error matrix",,"Hubert, MH@Univ Jaffna, Dept Econ & Management, Jaffna, Sri Lanka@Univ Peradeniya, Fac Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Stat, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka::Wijekoon, P@Univ Jaffna, Dept Econ & Management, Jaffna, Sri Lanka@Univ Peradeniya, Fac Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Stat, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka","Hubert, MH@Unknow@University of Peradeniya::Wijekoon, P@Unknow@University of Peradeniya","Wijekoon, Pushpakanthie@L-1238-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4242-1017","More on the New Biased Estimator in Linear Regression+Akdeniz, F.; Kaciranlar, S.+Sankhya: The Indian Journal of Statistics, Series B (1960- 2002)+2001::NONNEGATIVE AND POSITIVE DEFINITENESS OF MATRICES MODIFIED BY 2 MATRICES OF RANK ONE+BAKSALARY, JK; TRENKLER, G+LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS+JUN 1991::A new biased estimator in linear regression and a detailed analysis of the widely-analysed dataset on Portland cement+Kaciranlar, S.; Sakallioglu, S.; Akdeniz, F.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Styan, G.P.H.; Werner, H.J</span>.+Sankhya Indian J.

Dispersive ordering - Some applications and examples,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-005-0285-4,MAR 2006,63,11,"A basic concept for comparing spread among probability distributions is that of dispersive ordering. Let X and Y be two random variables with distribution functions F and G, respectively. Let F-1 and G(-1) be their right continuous inverses (quantile functions). We say that Y is less dispersed than X ( Y <=(disp) X) if G(-1)(beta) - G(-1)(alpha) <= F-1(beta) - F-1(alpha), for all 0 < alpha <= beta < 1. This means that the difference between any two quantiles of G is smaller than the difference between the corresponding quantiles of F. A consequence of Y <=(disp) X is that vertical bar Y-1 - Y(2)vertical bar is stochastically smaller than vertical bar X-1 - X(2)vertical bar and this in turn implies var(Y) : var(X) as well as E[vertical bar Y-1 - Y(2)vertical bar] <= E[X-1 - X(2)vertical bar], where X-1, X-2 (Y-1, Y-2) are two independent copies of X (Y). In this review paper, we give several examples and applications of dispersive ordering in statistics. Examples include those related to order statistics, spacings, convolution of non-identically distributed random variables and epoch times of non-homogeneous Poisson processes.","exponential distribution,proportional hazard rates,hazaxd rate ordering,Schur functions,majorization and p-larger ordering,convolutions,parallel systems,gamma distribution,t-distribution","EXPONENTIAL RANDOM-VARIABLES,STOCHASTIC COMPARISONS,LINEAR-COMBINATIONS,RESTRICTED FAMILIES,PARALLEL SYSTEMS,RANK-TESTS,DISTRIBUTIONS,STATISTICS,SPACINGS,TAIL","Jeon, J@Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 151742, South Korea@Portland State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Portland, OR 97201 USA@Carleton Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada::Kochar, S@Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 151742, South Korea@Portland State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Portland, OR 97201 USA@Carleton Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada::Park, CG@Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 151742, South Korea@Portland State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Portland, OR 97201 USA@Carleton Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Jeon, J@Seoul National University@Portland State University@Oregon University System@Carleton University::Kochar, S@Seoul National University@Portland State University@Oregon University System@Carleton University::Park, CG@Seoul National University@Portland State University@Oregon University System@Carleton University","Kochar, Subhash@A-8234-2009","DISPERSIVE AND SUPERADDITIVE ORDERING+AHMED, AN; ALZAID, A; BARTOSZEWICZ, J; et al.+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+DEC 1986::no title+AVEROUS J+IN PRESS J MULTIVARI+2004::ON TAIL-ORDERING AND COMPARISON OF FAILURE RATES+BAGAI, I; KOCHAR, SC+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1986::no title+Barlow, R.

Kernel smoothed prediction intervals for ARMA models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-005-0269-4,JAN 2006,9,0,The procedures of estimating prediction intervals for ARMA processes can be divided into model based methods and empirical methods. Model based methods require knowledge of the model and the underlying innovation distribution. Empirical methods axe based on sample forecast errors. In this paper we apply nonparametric quantile regression to empirical forecast errors using lead time as regressor. Using this method there is no need for a distributional assumption. But for the special data pattern in this application a double kernel method which allows smoothing in two directions is required.

Ahmed and Saleh (1990) considered preliminary test maximum likelihood estimator (PMLTE) for estimating it, based on the Hotelling's T-N(2) when it is suspected that mu(1) = mu(2). In this paper, the PTMLE based on the Wald (W), Likelihood Ratio (LR) and Lagrangian Multiplier (LM) tests are considered. Using the quadratic risk function, the conditions of superiority of the proposed estimator for departure parameter are derived. A max-min rule for the size of the preliminary test of significance is presented. It is demonstrated that the PTMLE based on W test produces the highest minimum guaranteed efficiencies compared to UMLE among the three test procedures.","dominance,Hotelling's T-2,Lagrangian multiplier,likelihood ratio test,multivariate normal,non-central Chi square and F,risk,Wald test","CRITERIA,CONFLICT","Kibria, BMG@Florida Int Univ, Dept Stat, Miami, FL 33199 USA@Carleton Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada::Saleh, AKME@Florida Int Univ, Dept Stat, Miami, FL 33199 USA@Carleton Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Kibria, BMG@Florida International University@State University System of Florida@Carleton University::Saleh, AKME@Florida International University@State University System of Florida@Carleton University",not exist,"To pool or not to pool: the multivariate data+Ahmed, S.

A randomized response procedure for multiple-sensitive questions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0374-5,AUG 2012,24,9,"The Randomized Response (RR) technique is a well-established interview procedure which guarantees privacy protection in social surveys dealing with sensitive items. The RR method assumes a stochastic mechanism to create uncertainty about the true status of the respondents in order to ensure privacy protection and to avoid tendencies to dissimulate or respond in a socially desirable direction. A very general model for the RR method was introduced by Franklin (Commun Stat Theory Methods 18:489-505, 1989) when a single-sensitive question is under study. However, since social surveys are often based on questionnaires containing more than a single-sensitive question, the analysis of multivariate RR data is of considerable interest. This paper focuses on the generalization of the Franklin model in a multiple-sensitive question setting and on related inferential issues.","Randomized response,Multiple-sensitive questions,Proportion estimation","DICHOTOMOUS POPULATION,PROPORTION,DISTRIBUTIONS","Barabesi, Lucio@Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit, I-53100 Siena, Italy::Franceschi, Sara@Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit, I-53100 Siena, Italy::Marcheselli, Marzia@Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Barabesi, Lucio@University of Siena::Franceschi, Sara@University of Siena::Marcheselli, Marzia@University of Siena","BARABESI, LUCIO@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7210-4541::Franceschi, Sara@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6675-4540","A practical implementation and bayesian estimation in Franklin's randomized response procedure+Barabesi, L; Marcheselli, M+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+JUL-SEP 2006::A design-based randomized response procedure for the estimation of population proportion and sensitivity level+Barabesi, L.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 2008::Bayesian estimation of proportion and sensitivity level in randomized response procedures+Barabesi, Lucio; Marcheselli, Marzia+METRIKA+JUL 2010::ASSURING CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESPONSES IN SOCIAL RESEARCH - NOTE ON STRATEGIES+BORUCH, RF+AMERICAN SOCIOLOGIST+1971::ON THE ANALYSIS OF SOME MULTIVARIATE RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE DESIGNS FOR CATEGORICAL-DATA+BOURKE, PD+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+1981::Optional versus compulsory randomized response techniques in complex surveys+Chaudhuri, A; Saha, A+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 1 2005::Using randomized response from a complex survey to estimate a sensitive proportion in a dichotomous finite population+Chaudhuri, A+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1 2001::no title+Chaudhuri, A.; Mukerjee, R.+Randomized Response: Theory and Techniques+1988::Estimating a sensitive proportion through randomized response procedures based on auxiliary information+Diana, Giancarlo; Perri, Pier Francesco+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 2009::THEORY OF RANDOMIZED RESPONSES TO 2 SENSITIVE QUESTIONS+DRANE, W+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1976::A COMPARISON OF ESTIMATORS FOR RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE SAMPLING WITH CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS FROM A DICHOTOMOUS POPULATION+FRANKLIN, LA+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1989::A new randomized response model+Gjestvang, CR; Singh, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::The unrelated question randomized response model+Horvitz, D.G; Shah, B.V.; Simmons, W.R.+P SOC STAT SECT AM S+1967::Estimation of sensitive data from a dichotomous population+Huang, KC+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JAN 2006::ASKING SENSITIVE QUESTIONS INDIRECTLY+KUK, AYC+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1990::Meta-analysis of randomized response research thirty-five years of validation+Lensvelt-Mulders, GJLM; Hox, JJ; van der Heuden, PGM; et al.+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+FEB 2005::Simultaneous confidence intervals based on the percentile bootstrap approach+Mandel, Micha; Betensky, Rebecca A.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 10 2008::no title+Mangat, N.

We first propose a jackknifed RSS-ratio estimator and then introduce a class of almost unbiased RSS-ratio estimators of the population mean. We also present an unbiased RSS-ratio estimator of the mean using the idea of Hartley and Ross (Nature 174:270-271, 1954) which performs better than its counterpart with simple random sample data. We show that under certain conditions the proposed unbiased and almost unbiased RSS-ratio estimators perform better than the commonly used (biased) RSS-ratio estimator in estimating the population mean in terms of the mean square error. The theoretical results are augmented by a simulation study using a wheat yield data set from the Iranian Ministry of Agriculture to demonstrate the practical benefits of our proposed ratio-type estimators relative to the RSS-ratio estimator in reducing the bias in estimating the average wheat production.","Almost unbiased,Auxiliary variable,Jackknife,Ranked set sampling,Ratio estimator,Relative efficiency,Simple random sampling",,"Jozani, Mohammad Jafari@Univ Manitoba, Dept Stat, Winnipeg, MB R3T 3Z2, Canada::Majidi, Saeed@Allameh Tabatabaie Univ, Dept Stat, Tehran, Iran::Perron, Francois@Univ Montreal, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada","Jozani, Mohammad Jafari@University of Manitoba::Majidi, Saeed@Allameh Tabataba'i University::Perron, Francois@University of Montreal",not exist,"A note on the application of Quenouille's method of bias reduction to the estimation of ratios+Durbin, J.+Biometrika+1959::UNBIASED RATIO ESTIMATORS+HARTLEY, HO; ROSS, A+NATURE+1954::Ratio estimator for the population mean using ranked set sampling+Kadilar, Cem; Unyazici, Yesim; Cingi, Hulya+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAR 2009::no title+MURTHY MN+SANKHYA+1959::NOTES ON BIAS IN ESTIMATION+QUENOUILLE, MH+BIOMETRIKA+1956::Estimation of ratio using rank set sampling+Samawi, HM; Muttlak, HA+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1996"
Identifying the determinants of foreign direct investment: a data-specific model selection approach,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0377-2,AUG 2012,22,1,"In this paper, we examine the potential determinants of foreign direct investment. For this purpose, we apply new exact subset selection procedures, which are based on idealized assumptions, as well as their possibly more plausible empirical counterparts to an international data set to select the optimal set of predictors. Unlike the standard model selection procedures AIC and BIC, which penalize only the number of variables included in a model, and the subset selection procedures RIC and MRIC, which consider also the total number of available candidate variables, our data-specific procedures even take the correlation structure of all candidate variables into account. Our main focus is on a new procedure, which we have designed for situations where some of the potential predictors are certain to be included in the model. For a sample of 73 developing countries, this procedure selects only four variables, namely imports, net income from abroad, gross capital formation, and GDP per capita. An important secondary finding of our study is that the data-specific procedures, which are based on extensive simulations and are therefore very time-consuming, can be approximated reasonably well by the much simpler exact methods.","Foreign direct investment,Non-nested models,Model selection,Subset selection,Mean squared prediction error,Penalty","INFLATION CRITERION,POLICY","Reschenhofer, Erhard@Univ Vienna, Dept Stat & Operat Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria::Schilde, Michael@Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, A-1210 Vienna, Austria::Oberecker, Eva@Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, A-1210 Vienna, Austria::Payr, Ellen@Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, A-1210 Vienna, Austria::Tandogan, Hasan T.@Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, A-1210 Vienna, Austria::Wakolbinger, Lea M.@Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, A-1210 Vienna, Austria","Reschenhofer, Erhard@University of Vienna::Schilde, Michael@University of Vienna::Oberecker, Eva@University of Vienna::Payr, Ellen@University of Vienna::Tandogan, Hasan T.@University of Vienna::Wakolbinger, Lea M.@University of Vienna","Schilde, Michael@C-7431-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7861-3091","FITTING AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS FOR PREDICTION+AKAIKE, H+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+1969::Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::Embedded economies: Social relations as determinants of foreign direct investment in Central and Eastern Europe+Bandelj, N+SOCIAL FORCES+DEC 2002::Main determinants of Foreign direct investment in the Southeast European Countries+Botri, V.; Skufli, L.+Transition Studies Review+2006::The determinants of foreign direct investment: Sensitivity analyses of cross-country regressions+Chakrabarti, A+KYKLOS+2001::THE RISK INFLATION CRITERION FOR MULTIPLE-REGRESSION+FOSTER, DP; GEORGE, EI+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1994::Calibration and empirical Bayes variable selection+George, EI; Foster, DP+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2000::Attracting FDI: are other government policies more important than taxation in attracting FDI?+Goodspeed, TJ; Vazquez, JM; Zhang, L.+Hunter college department of economics working papers 414+2006::THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF COUNTRIES TO FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT - IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION+JACKSON, S; MARKOWSKI, S+JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE+OCT 1995::Foreign direct investment financing of capital formation in central and eastern Europe+Krkoska, L.+Working paper aeries 67+2001::POLICY AND NON-POLICY DETERMINANTS OF US EQUITY FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT+LOREE, DW; GUISINGER, SE+JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES+1995::no title+Markusen, James R.+Multinational Firms and the Theory of International Trade+2002::FLOWS OF DIRECT-INVESTMENT AND THEIR EFFECTS ON INVESTMENT IN CANADA+NOORZOY, MS+ECONOMICS LETTERS+1979::Investimenti diretti esteri e fattori di localizzazione: L'america latina e il sud est asiatico+Pistoresi, B.+Rivi Polit Econ+2000::On subset selection and beyond+Reschenhofer, E.+Adv Appl Stat+2004::Improved estimation of the expected Kullback-Leibler discrepancy in case of misspecification+Reschenhofer, E+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 1999::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::The impact of host country government policy on US multinational investment decisions+Taylor, CT+WORLD ECONOMY+MAY 2000::The covariance inflation criterion for adaptive model selection+Tibshirani, R; Knight, K+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1999::Determinants of economic development and its impact on economic growth+Tsai, P.+Journal of Economic 'Development+1994::World Investment Report 2008: Transnational Corporations and the Infrastructure Challenge+no author+WORLD INV REP 2008 T+2008::no title+no author+The World Development Indicators+2007"

These are called the upper and lower current records and are denoted by and , respectively. The interval is then referred to as the record coverage. The prediction problem in the two-sample case is then discussed and, specifically, the exact outer and inner prediction intervals are derived for order statistics intervals from an independent future Y-sample based on the m-th record coverage from the X-sequence when the underlying distribution of the two samples are the same. The coverage probabilities of these intervals are exact and do not depend on the underlying distribution. Distribution-free prediction intervals as well as upper and lower prediction limits for spacings from a future Y-sample are obtained in terms of the record range from the X-sequence.","Beta (gamma) function,Coverage probability,Record coverage,Record range,Spacing,Distribution-free intervals","PARAMETER EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION,FUTURE RECORDS,VALUES","Ahmadi, Jafar@Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Stat, Ordered & Spatial Data Ctr Excellence, Mashhad, Iran::Balakrishnan, N.@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada@Natl Ctr Univ, Jhongli, Taiwan","Ahmadi, Jafar@Ferdowsi University Mashhad::Balakrishnan, N.@National Central University@McMaster University","Ahmadi, Jafar@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2426-2019","Bayesian estimation and prediction for some life distributions based on record values+Ahmadi, J; Doostparast, M+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 2006::Prediction intervals for future records and order statistics coming from two parameter exponential distribution+Ahmadi, J.; MirMostafaee, S.

The necessary and sufficient condition for the equality of mean squared errors associated with the two competing predictors is provided in the bivariate MA(1) case. Furthermore, it is argued that the condition of equality of predictors as stated by Lutkepohl (Forecasting aggregated vector ARMA processes, Springer, Berlin, 1987) is only sufficient (not necessary) for the equality of mean squared errors. Finally, it is shown that the equality of forecasting accuracy for the two predictors can be achieved using specific assumptions on the parameters of the vector MA(1) structure.","Contemporaneous aggregation,Forecasting,Vector moving average models",TIME-SERIES,"Sbrana, Giacomo@Univ Strasbourg, BETA, F-67085 Strasbourg, France::Silvestrini, Andrea@Bank Italy, Econ Res & Int Relat Area, I-00184 Rome, Italy@Catholic Univ Louvain, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium","Sbrana, Giacomo@Universite de Strasbourg@Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes::Silvestrini, Andrea@Universite Catholique Louvain",not exist,"TIME-SERIES MODELING AND INTERPRETATION+GRANGER, CWJ; MORRIS, MJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1976::WHEN IS AN AGGREGATE OF A TIME-SERIES EFFICIENTLY FORECAST BY ITS PAST+KOHN, R+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1982::Practical estimation from the sum of AR(1) processes+Ku, S; Seneta, E+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1998::LINEAR AGGREGATION OF VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE MOVING AVERAGE PROCESSES+LUTKEPOHL, H+ECONOMICS LETTERS+1984::no title+Lutkepohl, H.+Forecasting Aggregated Vector ARMA Processes+1987::Forecasting contemporaneously aggregated vector ARMA processes+Lutkepohl, H.+J.

The uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator of odds ratio in case-control studies under inverse sampling,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0337-2,MAY 2012,9,0,"The stated goal of this paper is to propose the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator of odds ratio in case-control studies under inverse sampling design. The problem of estimating odds ratio plays a central role in case-control studies. However, the traditional sampling schemes appear inadequate when the expected frequencies of not exposed cases and exposed controls can be very low. In such a case, it is convenient to use the inverse sampling design, which requires that random drawings shall be continued until a given number of relevant events has emerged. In this paper we prove that a uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator of odds ratio does not exist under usual binomial sampling, while the standard odds ratio estimator is uniformly minimum variance unbiased under inverse sampling. In addition, we compare these two sampling schemes by means of large-sample theory and small-sample simulation.","Case-control study,Inverse sampling,Odds ratio,UMVU estimator,Monte Carlo method",,"Quatto, Piero@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, I-20126 Milan, Italy::Zambon, Antonella@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Quatto, Piero@University of Milano-Bicocca@Istituto Nazionale Tumori::Zambon, Antonella@University of Milano-Bicocca@Istituto Nazionale Tumori","Zambon, Antonella@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6443-3858","Inverse Sampling for Clinical Trials: A Brief Review of Theory and Practice+Biswas, Atanu; Bandyopadhyay, Uttam+STATISTICAL ADVANCES IN THE BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES: CLINICAL TRIALS, EPIDEMIOLOGY, SURVIVAL ANALYSIS, AND BIOINFORMATICS+2008::Estimation of a sensitive proportion by Warner's randomized response data through inverse sampling+Chaudhuri, Arijit; Bose, Mausumi; Dihidar, Kajal+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAY 2011::On inverse sampling without replacement+Espejo, MR; Singh, HP; Saxena, S.+Stat Pap+2008::Inverse sampling of controls in a matched case-control study+Keogh, R.

How to improve the fit of Archimedean copulas by means of transforms,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0341-6,MAY 2012,10,8,"The selection of copulas is an important aspect of dependence modeling issues. In many practical applications, only a limited number of copulas is tested and the copula with the best result for a goodness-of-fit test is chosen, which, however, does not always lead to the best possible fit. In this paper we develop a practical and logical method for improving the goodness-of-fit of a particular Archimedean copula by means of transforms. In order to do this, we introduce concordance invariant transforms which can also be tail dependence preserving, based on an analysis on the lambda-function, lambda = phi/phi is the Archimedean generator. The methodology is applied to the data set studied in Cook and Johnson (J R Stat Soc B 43:210-218, 1981) and Genest and Rivest (J Am Stat Assoc 88:1043-1043, 1993), where we improve the fit of the Frank copula and obtain statistically significant results.","Copula,Kendall's tau,Archimedean copula,Tail dependence coefficient,Transform",DISTRIBUTIONS,"Michiels, Frederik@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium::De Schepper, Ann@Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium@Univ Antwerp, StatUa Stat Ctr, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium","Michiels, Frederik@University of Antwerp::De Schepper, Ann@University of Antwerp","De Schepper, Ann@A-1915-2016@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3175-6121","A FAMILY OF DISTRIBUTIONS FOR MODELING NON-ELLIPTICALLY SYMMETRIC MULTIVARIATE DATA+COOK, RD; JOHNSON, ME+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1981::Archimedean copulae for risk measurement+De Luca, Giovanni; Rivieccio, Giorgia+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+2009::THE JOY OF COPULAS - BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS WITH UNIFORM MARGINALS+GENEST, C; MACKAY, J+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1986::Goodness-of-fit tests for copulas: a review and a power study+Genest, C; Remillard, B; Beaudoin, D.+Insur Math Econ+2007::Statistical inference procedures for bivariate archimedian copulas+Genest, C; Rivest, L.+J Am Stat Assoc+1993::no title+GENEST C+N AM ACTUARIAL J+1998::A new method for the construction of bivariate Archimedean copulas based on the lambda-function+Michiels, F; Koch, I; De Schepper, A.+Commun Stat Theory Meth+2010::Understanding copula transforms: a review of dependence properties+Michiels, F.; De Schepper, A.+Working paper No. 2009012+2009::A COPULA TEST SPACE MODEL HOW TO AVOID THE WRONG COPULA CHOICE+Michiels, Frederik; De Schepper, Ann+KYBERNETIKA+2008::no title+Nelsen, R.

Robust second-order least-squares estimator for regression models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0343-4,MAY 2012,18,2,"The second-order least-squares estimator (SLSE) was proposed by Wang (Statistica Sinica 13:1201-1210, 2003) for measurement error models.

The SLSE is asymptotically more efficient than the ordinary least-squares estimator if the error distribution has a nonzero third moment. However, it lacks robustness against outliers in the data. In this paper, we propose a robust second-order least squares estimator (RSLSE) against X-outliers. The RSLSE is highly efficient with high breakdown point and is asymptotically normally distributed. We compare the RSLSE with other estimators through a simulation study.

Likelihood ratio inference for mean residual life,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0345-2,MAY 2012,11,2,"One of the basic parameters in survival analysis is the mean residual life M (0). For right censored observation, the usual empirical likelihood based log-likelihood ratio leads to a scaled chi(2)(1) limit distribution and estimating the scaled parameter leads to lower coverage of the corresponding confidence interval. To solve the problem, we present a log-likelihood ratio l(M (0)) by methods of Murphy and van der Vaart (Ann Stat 1471-1509, 1997). The limit distribution of l(M (0)) is the standard chi(2)(1) distribution. Based on the limit distribution of l(M (0)), the corresponding confidence interval of M (0) is constructed. Since the proof of the limit distribution does not offer a computational method for the maximization of the log-likelihood ratio, an EM algorithm is proposed. Simulation studies support the theoretical result.","Mean residual life,Log-likelihood ratio,Empirical likelihood,EM algorithm","RANDOM CENSORSHIP,MODELS","Shen, Junshan@Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China::Liang, Wei@Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China::He, Shuyuan@Capital Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China","Shen, Junshan@Peking University::Liang, Wei@Peking University::He, Shuyuan@Capital Normal University",not exist,"INFORMATION AND ASYMPTOTIC EFFICIENCY IN PARAMETRIC NONPARAMETRIC MODELS+BEGUN, JM; HALL, WJ; HUANG, WM; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1983::no title+Bickel,, P.

Finite-sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimator for the binary logit model with random covariates,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0348-z,MAY 2012,22,1,"We examine the finite sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimator for the binary logit model with random covariates. Previous studies have either relied on large-sample asymptotics or have assumed non-random covariates. Analytic expressions for the first-order bias and second-order mean squared error function for the maximum likelihood estimator in this model are derived, and we undertake numerical evaluations to illustrate these analytic results for the single covariate case. For various data distributions, the bias of the estimator is signed the same as the covariate's coefficient, and both the absolute bias and the mean squared errors increase symmetrically with the absolute value of that parameter. The behaviour of a bias-adjusted maximum likelihood estimator, constructed by subtracting the (maximum likelihood) estimator of the first-order bias from the original estimator, is examined in a Monte Carlo experiment. This bias-correction is effective in all of the cases considered, and is recommended for use when this logit model is estimated by maximum likelihood using small samples.","Logit model,Bias,Mean squared error,Bias correction,Random covariates","CHI-SQUARE ESTIMATOR,LOGISTIC FUNCTION,BIAS CORRECTION,REGRESSION,BIOASSAY","Chen, Qian@Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China::Giles, David E.@Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada","Chen, Qian@Central University of Finance & Economics::Giles, David E.@University of Victoria",not exist,"CORRECTION+AMEMIYA, T+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1984::THE N-2-ORDER MEAN SQUARED ERRORS OF THE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD AND THE MINIMUM LOGIT CHI-SQUARE ESTIMATOR+AMEMIYA, T+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1980::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD AND MINIMUM X2 ESTIMATES OF THE LOGISTIC FUNCTION+BERKSON, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1955::Application of the logistic function to bio-assay+Berkson, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1944::Finite-sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimator for the Poisson regression model with random covariates+Chen, Q; Giles, DE.+Commun Stat Theory Methods+2010::BIAS CORRECTION IN GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+CORDEIRO, GM; MCCULLAGH, P+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::A GENERAL DEFINITION OF RESIDUALS+COX, DR; SNELL, EJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1968::COMMENTS ON A PAPER BY AMEMIYA,T.

Consistency of the kernel density estimator: a survey,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0338-1,FEB 2012,29,22,"Various consistency proofs for the kernel density estimator have been developed over the last few decades. Important milestones are the pointwise consistency and almost sure uniform convergence with a fixed bandwidth on the one hand and the rate of convergence with a fixed or even a variable bandwidth on the other hand. While considering global properties of the empirical distribution functions is sufficient for strong consistency, proofs of exact convergence rates use deeper information about the underlying empirical processes. A unifying character, however, is that earlier and more recent proofs use bounds on the probability that a sum of random variables deviates from its mean.","Kernel estimation,Pointwise consistency,Strong uniform consistency,Empirical process,Rate of convergence,Variable bandwidth","EMPIRICAL PROCESSES,PROBABILITY DENSITIES,OSCILLATION BEHAVIOR,BANDWIDTH,SELECTION","Wied, Dominik@Tech Univ Dortmund, Inst Wirtschafts & Sozialstat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Weissbach, Rafael@Univ Rostock, Lehrstuhl Stat, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, D-18051 Rostock, Germany","Wied, Dominik@Dortmund University of Technology::Weissbach, Rafael@University of Rostock",not exist,"no title+Buning, H.; Trenkler, G.+Nichtparametrische statistische Methoden+1994::General asymptotic confidence bands based on kernel-type function estimators+Deheuvels, P.; Mason, D.

When does Heckman's two-step procedure for censored data work and when does it not?,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0306-9,FEB 2012,24,3,"Heckman's two-step procedure (Heckit) for estimating the parameters in linear models from censored data is frequently used by econometricians, despite of the fact that earlier studies cast doubt on the procedure. In this paper it is shown that estimates of the hazard h for approaching the censoring limit, the latter being used as an explanatory variable in the second step of the Heckit, can induce multicollinearity. The influence of the censoring proportion and sample size upon bias and variance in three types of random linear models are studied by simulations. From these results a simple relation is established that describes how absolute bias depends on the censoring proportion and the sample size. It is also shown that the Heckit may work with non-normal (Laplace) distributions, but it collapses if h deviates too much from that of the normal distribution. Data from a study of work resumption after sick-listing are used to demonstrate that the Heckit can be very risky.","Panel data,Censoring,Bias","LIMITED DEPENDENT-VARIABLES,SAMPLE SELECTION,REGRESSION-MODELS,LOW-BACK,ESTIMATORS,ERROR","Jonsson, Robert@Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden","Jonsson, Robert@University of Gothenburg",not exist,"no title+Bergendorff, S; Hansson, E; Hansson, T<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Jonsson, R</span>.+Predictors of health status and work resumption+2001::Choosing between and interpreting the Heckit and two-part models for corner solutions+Dow, William H; Norton, Edward C.+&lt;IT&gt;Health Services and Outcomes Research Methodology&lt;/IT&gt;+2003::A Monte Carlo simulation study of Tobit models+Flood, L; Grasjo, U+APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS+SEP 2001::Values of Mills' ratio of area to bounding ordinate and of the normal probability integral for large values of the argument+Gordon, RD+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1941::Predictors for work ability and disability in men and women with low-back or neck problems+Hansson, E; Hansson, T; Jonsson, R+EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL+JUN 2006::The effects of common medical interventions on pain, back function, and work resumption in patients with chronic low back pain - A prospective 2-year cohort study in six countries+Hansson, TH; Hansson, EK+SPINE+DEC 1 2000::COMMON STRUCTURE OF STATISTICAL-MODELS OF TRUNCATION, SAMPLE SELECTION AND LIMITED DEPENDENT VARIABLES AND A SIMPLE ESTIMATOR FOR SUCH MODELS+HECKMAN, JJ+ANNALS OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MEASUREMENT+1976::SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS AS A SPECIFICATION ERROR+HECKMAN, JJ+ECONOMETRICA+1979::TESTING THE ERROR-COMPONENTS MODEL WITH NONNORMAL DISTURBANCES+HONDA, Y+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+OCT 1985::no title+Hsiao, C.+Analysis of Panel Data+2003::no title+Johnson, N.L; Kotz, S; Balakrishnan, N.+Continuous Univariate Distributions+1994::no title+Karlsson, M.+Estimators of semiparametric truncated and censored regression models+2005::Efficient score estimation and adaptive M-estimators in censored and truncated regression models+Kim, CK; Lai, TL+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2000::no title+Kruskal, WH; Tanur, JM.+International encyclopedia of statistics+1978::no title+Lee, MJ.+Method of moments and semiparametric econometrics for limited dependent variable models+1996::Test of random subject effects in heteroskedastic linear models+Lundevaller, EH; Laitila, T+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+2002::EFFICIENCY OF THE 2-STEP ESTIMATOR FOR MODELS WITH ENDOGENOUS SAMPLE SELECTION+NELSON, FD+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1984::A MONTE-CARLO COMPARISON OF ESTIMATORS FOR CENSORED REGRESSION-MODELS+PAARSCH, HJ+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+1984::Estimation of Semiparametric Models+Powell, J.+Handbook of Econometrics+1994::The Heckman correction for sample selection and its critique+Puhani, PA+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS+FEB 2000::THEORY OF LEAST SQUARES WHEN PARAMETERS ARE STOCHASTIC AND ITS APPLICATION TO ANALYSIS OF GROWTH CURVES+RAO, CR+BIOMETRIKA+1965::ESTIMATION OF TWO-LIMIT PROBIT REGRESSION MODEL+ROSETT, RN; NELSON, FD+ECONOMETRICA+1975::no title+Swamy, P.+Statistical Inference in Random Coefficient Regression Models+1971::ESTIMATION OF RELATIONSHIPS FOR LIMITED DEPENDENT-VARIABLES+TOBIN, J+ECONOMETRICA+1958"

A combined test for differences in scale based on the interquantile range,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0308-7,FEB 2012,20,9,"A class of tests due to Shoemaker (Commun Stat Simul Comput 28: 189-205, 1999) for differences in scale which is valid for a variety of both skewed and symmetric distributions when location is known or unknown is considered. The class is based on the interquantile range and requires that the population variances are finite. In this paper, we firstly propose a permutation version of it that does not require the condition of finite variances and is remarkably more powerful than the original one. Secondly we solve the question of what quantile choose by proposing a combined interquantile test based on our permutation version of Shoemaker tests. Shoemaker showed that the more extreme interquantile range tests are more powerful than the less extreme ones, unless the underlying distributions are very highly skewed. Since in practice you may not know if the underlying distributions are very highly skewed or not, the question arises. The combined interquantile test solves this question, is robust and more powerful than the stand alone tests. Thirdly we conducted a much more detailed simulation study than that of Shoemaker (1999) that compared his tests to the F and the squared rank tests showing that his tests are better. Since the F and the squared rank test are not good for differences in scale, his results suffer of such a drawback, and for this reason instead of considering the squared rank test we consider, following the suggestions of several authors, tests due to Brown-Forsythe (J Am Stat Assoc 69:364-367, 1974), Pan (J Stat Comput Simul 63:59-71, 1999), O'Brien (J Am Stat Assoc 74:877-880, 1979) and Conover et al.

Two-sample empirical likelihood method for difference between coefficients in linear regression model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0314-9,FEB 2012,18,10,"The empirical likelihood method is proposed to construct the confidence regions for the difference in value between coefficients of two-sample linear regression model. Unlike existing empirical likelihood procedures for one-sample linear regression models, as the empirical likelihood ratio function is not concave, the usual maximum empirical likelihood estimation cannot be obtained directly. To overcome this problem, we propose to incorporate a natural and well-explained restriction into likelihood function and obtain a restricted empirical likelihood ratio statistic (RELR). It is shown that RELR has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution. Furthermore, to improve the coverage accuracy of the confidence regions, a Bartlett correction is applied. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a simulation study.","Bartlett correction,Coverage accuracy,Empirical likelihood,Linear regression model,Two-sample problem","CONFIDENCE-REGIONS,INTERVALS","Zi, Xuemin@Tianjin Univ Technol & Educ, Dept Math, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China::Zou, Changliang@Nankai Univ, Dept Stat, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Liu, Yukun@E China Normal Univ, Sch Finance & Stat, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China","Zi, Xuemin@Unknow::Zou, Changliang@Nankai University::Liu, Yukun@East China Normal University",not exist,"Adjusted empirical likelihood and its properties+Chen, Jiahua; Variyath, Asokan Mulayath; Abraham, Bovas+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2008::ON THE ACCURACY OF EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD CONFIDENCE-REGIONS FOR LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL+CHEN, SX+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+DEC 1993::EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR LINEAR-REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS+CHEN, SX+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+APR 1994::Empirical likelihood confidence region for parameter in the errors-in-variables models+Cui, HJ; Chen, SX+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2003::no title+Davison, A.

Multivariate normal distribution approaches for dependently truncated data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0321-x,FEB 2012,27,7,"Many statistical methods for truncated data rely on the independence assumption regarding the truncation variable. In many application studies, however, the dependence between a variable X of interest and its truncation variable L plays a fundamental role in modeling data structure. For truncated data, typical interest is in estimating the marginal distributions of (L, X) and often in examining the degree of the dependence between X and L. To relax the independence assumption, we present a method of fitting a parametric model on (L, X), which can easily incorporate the dependence structure on the truncation mechanisms. Focusing on a specific example for the bivariate normal distribution, the score equations and Fisher information matrix are provided. A robust procedure based on the bivariate t-distribution is also considered. Simulations are performed to examine finite-sample performances of the proposed method.

Minimax prediction in the linear model with a relative squared error,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0325-6,FEB 2012,19,0,"Arnold and Stahlecker (Stat Pap 44: 107-115, 2003) considered the prediction of future values of the dependent variable in the linear regression model with a relative squared error and deterministic disturbances. They found an explicit form for a minimax linear affine solution d* of that problem. In the paper we generalize this result proving that the decision rule d* is also minimax when the class D of possible predictors of the dependent variable is unrestricted. Then we show that d* remains minimax in D when the disturbances are random with the mean vector zero and the known positive definite covariance matrix.","Linear regression,Minimax estimator,Minimax predictor","REGRESSION,RESTRICTIONS","Wilczynski, Maciej@Wroclaw Univ Technol, Inst Math & Comp Sci, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland","Wilczynski, Maciej@Wroclaw University of Science & Technology",not exist,"Uniformly best estimation in linear regression when prior information is fuzzy+Arnold, Bernhard F.; Stahlecker, Peter+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 2010::Another view of the Kuks-Olman estimator+Arnold, BF; Stahlecker, P+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 15 2000::Relative squared error prediction in the generalized linear regression model+Arnold, BF; Stahlecker, P+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JAN 2003::Minimax estimation in linear regression under restrictions+Blaker, H+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1 2000::Reparametrization methods in linear minimax estimation+Drygas, H.+P 3 PAC AR STAT C ZE+1993::no title+GAFFKE N+STATISTICS+1989::Characterization of minimax linear estimators in linear regression+Hoffmann, K.+Mathematische Operationsforschung und Statistik, Series Statistics+1979::Minimax linear estimation of regression coefficients: II+Kuks, J; Olman, V.+Izv.

The regression parameters are estimated by using a closed skew normal (CSN) distribution, which is closed under conditioning and linear combination. The proposed model captures skewness in the response variable. Sometimes, we may encounter missing observations in the response variable, accordingly we model and predict the missing observations by a Bayesian approach using Gibbs sampling methods. Next, a simulation study is performed to asses our model validity. Also, the proposed model in this work is applied to CO data from Tehran, the capital city of Iran. Then, the accuracy of the CSN and Gaussian models is compared by cross validation criterion.","Bayesian prediction,Closed skew normal,Missing observations,MCMC",DISTRIBUTIONS,"Karimi, Omid@Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Stat, Tehran, Iran::Mohammadzadeh, Mohsen@Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Stat, Tehran, Iran","Karimi, Omid@Tarbiat Modares University::Mohammadzadeh, Mohsen@Tarbiat Modares University","Karimi, Omid@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7586-6587","A new spatial skew-normal random field model+Allard, Denis; Naveau, Philippe+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2007::SPATIAL DEPENDENCE AND SPATIAL STRUCTURAL INSTABILITY IN APPLIED REGRESSION-ANALYSIS+ANSELIN, L+JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE+MAY 1990::no title+Anselin,, L.+Spatial econometrics: methods and models+1988::Skew-normal linear mixed models+Arellano-Valle, R.B.; Bolfarine, H.; Lachos, V.H.+J.

Automatic estimation procedure in partial linear model with functional data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0280-2,NOV 2011,22,14,Partial linear modelling ideas have recently been adapted to situations when functional data are observed. This paper aims to complete the study of such model by proposing a fully automatic estimation procedure. This is achieved by constructing a data-driven method to choose the smoothing parameters entered in the nonparametric components of the model.

Robust inference for the stress-strength reliability,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0286-9,NOV 2011,18,9,"We address the problem of robust inference about the stress-strength reliability parameter R = P(X < Y), where X and Y are taken to be independent random variables. Indeed, although classical likelihood based procedures for inference on R are available, it is well-known that they can be badly affected by mild departures from model assumptions, regarding both stress and strength data. The proposed robust method relies on the theory of bounded influence M-estimators. We obtain large-sample test statistics with the standard asymptotic distribution by means of delta-method asymptotics. The finite sample behavior of these tests is investigated by some numerical studies, when both X and Y are independent exponential or normal random variables. An illustrative application in a regression setting is also discussed.","Delta method,Influence function,M-estimator,Stress-strength model,Studentized test statistic","PR Y LESS,P(X-LESS-THAN-Y),MODELS","Greco, Luca@Univ Sannio, Sect Stat, PE ME IS Dept, Benevento, Italy::Ventura, Laura@Univ Padua, Dept Stat, Padua, Italy","Greco, Luca@University of Sannio::Ventura, Laura@University of Padua",not exist,"Quasi-likelihood from M-estimators: a numerical comparison with empirical likelihood+Adimari, G; Ventura, L.+Stat Meth Appl+2002::Partially parametric interval estimation of Pr{Y &gt; X}+Adimari, Gianfranco; Chiogna, Monica+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 1 2006::ESTIMATION OF RELIABILITY FROM STRESS-STRENGTH RELATIONSHIPS+CHURCH, JD; HARRIS, B+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::Variance stabilization for a scalar parameter+DiCiccio, TJ; Monti, AC; Young, GA+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::ESTIMATION OF PR (Y LESS THAN X) IN NORMAL CASE+DOWNTON, F+TECHNOMETRICS+1973::CONFIDENCE-LIMITS FOR STRESS-STRENGTH MODELS WITH EXPLANATORY VARIABLES+GUTTMAN, I; JOHNSON, RA; BHATTACHARYYA, GK; et al.+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1988::no title+HADMY M+COMMUN STAT B+1995::A NOTE ON A DIFFICULTY INHERENT IN ESTIMATING RELIABILITY FROM STRESS STRENGTH RELATIONSHIPS+HARRIS, B; SOMS, AP+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+1983::no title+HELPERIN M+BIOMETRICS+1987::no title+HERITIER S+J AM STAT ASSOC+1994::A note on inference for P(X &lt; Y) for right truncated exponentially distributed data+Jiang, L.; Wong, A.

Bias-variance trade-off for prequential model list selection,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0289-6,NOV 2011,23,3,"The prequential approach to statistics leads naturally to model list selection because the sequential reformulation of the problem is a guided search over model lists drawn from a model space. That is, continually updating the action space of a decision problem to achieve optimal prediction forces the collection of models under consideration to grow neither too fast nor too slow to avoid excess variance and excess bias, respectively. At the same time, the goal of good predictive performance forces the search over good predictors formed from a model list to close in on the data generator. Taken together, prequential model list re-selection favors model lists which provide an effective approximation to the data generator but do so by making the approximation match the unknown function on important regions as determined by empirical bias and variance.","Prequential,Online prediction,Bias-variance trade-off,Model selection,Bayes model averaging,Model list selection","LINEAR-REGRESSION MODELS,ATOMIC DECOMPOSITION,VARIABLE SELECTION,BASIS PURSUIT,BAYES FACTORS,UNCERTAINTY,PREDICTION","Fokoue, Ernest@Rochester Inst Technol, Ctr Qual & Appl Stat, Rochester, NY 14623 USA::Clarke, Bertrand@Univ Miami, Dept Med, Miami, FL 33136 USA@Univ Miami, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Miami, FL 33136 USA@Univ Miami, Ctr Computat Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Fokoue, Ernest@Rochester Institute of Technology::Clarke, Bertrand@University of Miami",not exist,"Introducing model uncertainty by moving blocks bootstrap+Alonso, AM; Pena, D; Romo, J+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAR 2006::Optimal predictive model selection+Barbieri, MM; Berger, JO+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::no title+CHEN SB+THESIS STANFORD U+1995::Atomic decomposition by basis pursuit+Chen, SSB; Donoho, DL; Saunders, MA+SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING+1998::Atomic decomposition by basis pursuit+Chen, SSB; Donoho, DL; Saunders, MA+SIAM REVIEW+MAR 2001::no title+CLARKE J+STAT ANAL D IN PRESS+2009::Choosing the link function and accounting for link uncertainty in generalized linear models using Bayes factors+Czado, C; Raftery, AE+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 2006::TIME FREQUENCY LOCALIZATION OPERATORS - A GEOMETRIC PHASE-SPACE APPROACH+DAUBECHIES, I+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+JUL 1988::Prequential probability: principles and properties+Dawid, AP; Vovk, VG+BERNOULLI+FEB 1999::STATISTICAL-THEORY - THE PREQUENTIAL APPROACH+DAWID, AP+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+1984::ASSESSMENT AND PROPAGATION OF MODEL UNCERTAINTY+DRAPER, D+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1995::The variable selection problem+George, EI+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2000::VARIABLE SELECTION VIA GIBBS SAMPLING+GEORGE, EI; MCCULLOCH, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1993::Decomposing posterior variance+Gustafson, P; Clarke, B+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1 2004::Frequentist model average estimators+Hjort, NL; Claeskens, G+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2003::Bayesian model averaging: A tutorial+Hoeting, JA; Madigan, D; Raftery, AE; et al.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 1999::BAYES FACTORS+KASS, RE; RAFTERY, AE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1995::no title+Leamer, E.

Detecting changes from short to long memory,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0292-y,NOV 2011,25,13,"This paper studies well-known tests by Kim et al.

The potential break point is not assumed to be known but estimated from the data. First, we show that the tests are also applicable for a change from I (0) to a fractional order of integration I (d) with d > 0 (long memory) in that the tests are consistent. The rates of divergence of the test statistics are derived as functions of the sample size T and d. Second, we compare their finite sample power experimentally. Third, we consider break point estimation for a change from I (0) to I (d) for finite samples in computer simulations. It turns out that the estimators proposed for the integer case (d = 1) are practically reliable only if d is close enough to 1.","Change in persistence,Unknown change point,Change point estimation","STRUCTURAL BREAKS,WEAK-CONVERGENCE,TIME-SERIES,UNIT-ROOT,PERSISTENCE,TESTS,STATIONARITY,INTEGRATION,INFLATION,POWER","Hassler, Uwe@Goethe Univ Frankfurt, RuW, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany::Scheithauer, Jan@Goethe Univ Frankfurt, RuW, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany","Hassler, Uwe@Goethe University Frankfurt::Scheithauer, Jan@Goethe University Frankfurt",not exist,"HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::Least squares estimation of a shift in linear processes+Bai, Jushan.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1994::A proof of the power of Kim's test against stationary processes with structural breaks+Belaire-Franch, J+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+DEC 2005::Testing for a change of the long-memory parameter (vol 83, pg 627, 1996)+Beran, J; Terrin, N+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1999::Testing for a change of the long-memory parameter+Beran, J; Terrin, N+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1996::Tests of stationarity against a change in persistence+Busetti, F; Taylor, AMR+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2004::Inference for unstable long-memory processes with applications to fractional unit root autoregressions+Chan, NH; Terrin, N+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 1995::The functional central limit theorem and weak convergence to stochastic integrals II - Fractionally integrated processes+Davidson, J; de Jong, RM+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+OCT 2000::Fractional integration and structural breaks at unknown periods of time+Gil-Alana, Luis A.+JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS+JAN 2008::Changes in the order of integration of US and UK inflation+Halunga, Andreea G.; Osborn, Denise R.; Sensier, Marianne+ECONOMICS LETTERS+JAN 2009::Modified tests for a change in persistence+Harvey, David I.; Leybourne, Stephen J.; Taylor, A.

A new bivariate distribution with weighted exponential marginals and its multivariate generalization,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0300-2,NOV 2011,8,8,"Gupta and Kundu (Statistics 43:621-643, 2009) recently introduced a new class of weighted exponential distribution. It is observed that the proposed weighted exponential distribution is very flexible and can be used quite effectively to analyze skewed data. In this paper we propose a new bivariate distribution with the weighted exponential marginals. Different properties of this new bivariate distribution have been investigated. This new family has three unknown parameters, and it is observed that the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters can be obtained by solving a one-dimensional optimization procedure. We obtain the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimators. Small simulation experiments have been performed to see the behavior of the maximum likelihood estimators, and one data analysis has been presented for illustrative purposes. Finally we discuss the multivariate generalization of the proposed model.","Weighted exponential distribution,Maximum likelihood estimators,Skew-normal distribution,Hidden truncation models,Confidence intervals",,"Al-Mutairi, D.

Spatial analysis of auto-multivariate lattice data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0302-0,NOV 2011,17,3,"Most problems related to environmental studies are innately multivariate. In fact, in each spatial location more than one variable is usually measured. In geostatistics multivariate data analysis, where we intend to predict the value of a random vector in a new site, which has no data, cokriging method is used as the best linear unbiased prediction. In lattice data analysis, where almost exclusively the probability modeling of data is of concern, only auto-Gaussian model has been used for continuous multivariate data. For discrete multivariate data little work has been carried out. In this paper, an auto-multinomial model is suggested for analyzing multivariate lattice discrete data.

First, we extend the notion of MHD to a generalized version, i.e., the generalized MHD (GHMD), to make it suitable for the small sample with singular covariance matrix. We prove that GMHD is consistent with MHD when the sample has a full-rank covariance matrix. Second, we further extend GMHD to RKHS, i.e, the kernel mapped GMHD (kmGMHD), and discuss its main properties. Numeric results show that kmGMHD can give a better depth interpretation for the sample with special shape, such as a non-convex sample set. Our proposed kmGMHD can be potentially used as a robust tool for outliers detection and data classification.

On runs of length exceeding a threshold: normal approximation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0268-y,AUG 2011,40,10,Run statistics denoting number of runs and sum of run lengths are defined on binary sequences and their asymptotic normality is established by a simple unified way for Bernoulli sequences. All the considered statistics share a common feature; they refer to runs of length exceeding a specific length (a threshold). Asymptotic results of associated statistics denoting run lengths and waiting times are derived as well. Specific probabilities of the examined statistics are used in applications in the fields of system reliability and molecular biology. The study is illustrated by an extensive numerical experimentation.,"Run,Run length,Waiting time,Bernoulli trials,Limiting distribution,Asymptotic normality,Reliability,Statistical test","OUT-OF-N,OVERLAPPING SUCCESS RUNS,MARKOV DEPENDENT TRIALS,ORDER-K,BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTIONS,FAILURE SYSTEMS,LONGEST RUN,F SYSTEMS,SEQUENCE,NUMBER","Makri, Frosso S.@Univ Patras, Dept Math, Patras 26500, Greece::Psillakis, Zaharias M.@Univ Patras, Dept Phys, Patras 26500, Greece","Makri, Frosso S.@University of Patras::Psillakis, Zaharias M.@University of Patras",not exist,"GERT analysis of m-consecutive-k-out-of-n systems+Agarwal, Manju; Sen, Kanwar; Mohan, Pooja+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+MAR 2007::On the distribution of the total number of run lengths+Antzoulakos, DL; Bersimis, S; Koutras, MV+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+DEC 2003::no title+Balakrishnan, N; Koutras, M.

On estimation and local influence analysis for measurement errors models under heavy-tailed distributions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0270-4,AUG 2011,32,16,"Scale mixtures of normal distributions form a class of symmetric thick-tailed distributions that includes the normal one as a special case. In this paper we consider local influence analysis for measurement error models (MEM) when the random error and the unobserved value of the covariates jointly follow scale mixtures of normal distributions, providing an appealing robust alternative to the usual Gaussian process in measurement error models. In order to avoid difficulties in estimating the parameter of the mixing variable, we fixed it previously, as recommended by Lange et al. (J Am Stat Assoc 84:881-896, 1989) and Berkane et al. (Comput Stat Data Anal 18:255-267, 1994). The local influence method is used to assess the robustness aspects of the parameter estimates under some usual perturbation schemes. However, as the observed log-likelihood associated with this model involves some integrals, Cook's well-known approach may be hard to apply to obtain measures of local influence. Instead, we develop local influence measures following the approach of Zhu and Lee (J R Stat Soc Ser B 63:121-126, 2001), which is based on the EM algorithm. Results obtained from a real data set are reported, illustrating the usefulness of the proposed methodology, its relative simplicity, adaptability and practical usage.","EM algorithm,Mahalanobis distance,Measurement error models,Scale mixtures of normal distributions","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS,COMPARATIVE CALIBRATION,SCALE MIXTURES,T-DISTRIBUTION,VARIABLES,ALGORITHM","Lachos, V.

The generalized inverse Weibull distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0271-3,AUG 2011,29,23,"The inverse Weibull distribution has the ability to model failure rates which are quite common in reliability and biological studies. A three-parameter generalized inverse Weibull distribution with decreasing and unimodal failure rate is introduced and studied. We provide a comprehensive treatment of the mathematical properties of the new distribution including expressions for the moment generating function and the rth generalized moment. The mixture model of two generalized inverse Weibull distributions is investigated. The identifiability property of the mixture model is demonstrated. For the first time, we propose a location-scale regression model based on the log-generalized inverse Weibull distribution for modeling lifetime data. In addition, we develop some diagnostic tools for sensitivity analysis. Two applications of real data are given to illustrate the potentiality of the proposed regression model.","Censored data,Data analysis,Inverse Weibull distribution,Maximum likelihood estimation,Moment,Weibull regression model","LOCAL INFLUENCE,MODELS,RESIDUALS,REGRESSION,SURVIVAL,MIXTURE","de Gusmao, Felipe R.

Liu and Heyde (Stat Pap 49:455-469, 2008) give exact expressions for two-moment matrices, including the Hessian for ARCH models under elliptical distributions. In this paper, we extend the theory by establishing two additional moment matrices for conditional heteroskedastic models under elliptical distributions. The moment matrices established in this paper implement the maximum likelihood estimation by some estimation algorithms like the scoring method. We illustrate the applicability of the additional moment matrices established in this paper by applying them to establish an AR-ARCH model under an elliptical distribution.","Heteroskedasticity,Likelihood,BHHH method,Newton-Raphson method,Scoring method,AR-ARCH model","TIME-SERIES MODELS,SPECULATIVE PRICES,INFERENCE,VARIANCE,BEHAVIOR,MARKET","Liu, Shuangzhe@Univ Canberra, Fac Informat Sci & Engn, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia::Heyde, Chris C.@Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY USA@Australian Natl Univ, Inst Math Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia::Wong, Wing-Keung@Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China@Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Inst Computat Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Liu, Shuangzhe@University of Canberra::Heyde, Chris C.@Columbia University@Australian National University::Wong, Wing-Keung@Hong Kong Baptist University",not exist,"On the Markowitz mean-variance analysis of self-financing portfolios+Bai, Z.D.; Liu, H.X.; Wong, W.K.+Risk and Decision Analysis+2009::ENHANCEMENT OF THE APPLICABILITY OF MARKOWITZ'S PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION BY UTILIZING RANDOM MATRIX THEORY+Bai, Zhidong; Liu, Huixia; Wong, Wing-Keung+MATHEMATICAL FINANCE+OCT 2009::ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR STRUCTURAL MODELS+BERNDT, EK; HALL, BH; HALL, RE; et al.+ANNALS OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MEASUREMENT+1974::Semi-parametric modelling in finance: theoretical foundations+Bingham, NH; Kiesel, R.+Quant Finance+2002::COMPARISON OF STABLE AND STUDENT DISTRIBUTIONS AS STATISTICAL MODELS FOR STOCK PRICES+BLATTBERG, RC; GONEDES, NJ+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+1974::GENERALIZED AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY+BOLLERSLEV, T+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1986::A CONDITIONALLY HETEROSKEDASTIC TIME-SERIES MODEL FOR SPECULATIVE PRICES AND RATES OF RETURN+BOLLERSLEV, T+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1987::no title+Chan, N.

A class of estimators for the mean of a sensitive variable is proposed under a generic randomization model and the optimum estimator is obtained. Some special models are discussed in detail. To evaluate the degree of respondents' confidentiality in models using auxiliary variables, a new measure of privacy protection is introduced. Different models are then compared both from the perspective of efficiency and privacy protection.","Auxiliary variable,Privacy protection measures,Regression-type estimator,Scrambled responses,Simulation","RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE PROCEDURES,MODEL","Diana, Giancarlo@Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, I-35121 Padua, Italy::Perri, Pier Francesco@Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy","Diana, Giancarlo@University of Padua::Perri, Pier Francesco@University of Calabria",not exist,"On the design and quantification of privacy preserving data mining algorithms+Agrawal, D.; Aggarwal, C.

Individual asymptotic confidence intervals for the t-copula parameters and the corresponding tail dependence coefficient are derived. For two financial datasets these confidence intervals are calculated using both direct evaluation of the Fisher information and numerical evaluation of the Hessian matrix.

Weighted denoised minimum distance estimation in a regression model with autocorrelated measurement errors,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0227-7,MAY 2011,28,2,"This paper deals with the linear regression model with measurement errors in both response and covariates. The variables are observed with errors together with an auxiliary variable, such as time, and the errors in response are autocorrelated. We propose a weighted denoised minimum distance estimator (WDMDE) for the regression coefficients. The consistency, asymptotic normality, and strong convergence rate of the WDMDE are proved. Compared with the usual denoised least squares estimator (DLSE) in the previous literature, the WDMDE is asymptotically more efficient in the sense of having smaller variances. It also avoids undersmoothing the regressor functions over the auxiliary variable, so that data-driven optimal choice of the bandwidth can be used. Furthermore, we consider the fitting of the error structure, construct the estimators of the autocorrelation coefficients and the error variances, and derive their large-sample properties.

Asymptotic confidence intervals in ridge regression based on the Edgeworth expansion,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0229-5,MAY 2011,13,3,"Ridge Regression techniques have been found useful to reduce mean square errors of parameter estimates when multicollinearity is present. But the usefulness of the method rest not only upon its ability to produce good parameter estimates, with smaller mean squared error than Ordinary Least Squares, but also on having reasonable inferential procedures. The aim of this paper is to develop asymptotic confidence intervals for the model parameters based on Ridge Regression estimates and the Edgeworth expansion. Some simulation experiments are carried out to compare these confidence intervals with those obtained from the application of Ordinary Least Squares. Also, an example will be provided based on the well known data set of Hald.","Asymptotic confidence intervals,Collinearity,Edgeworth expansion,Ridge regression",ESTIMATORS,"Firinguetti, Luis@Univ Bio Bio, Fac Ciencias, Dept Matemat, Concepcion, Chile::Bobadilla, Gladys@Univ Santiago, Fac Ciencia, Dept Matemat & CC, Santiago 3363, Chile","Firinguetti, Luis@Universidad del Bio-Bio::Bobadilla, Gladys@Universidad de Santiago de Chile",not exist,"no title+CRIVELLI A+COMMUN STAT-SIMUL C+1996::SMOOTHING REGRESSION-COEFFICIENTS IN AN OVERSPECIFIED REGRESSION-MODEL WITH INTERRELATED EXPLANATORY VARIABLES+ELSTON, DA; PROE, MF+APPLIED STATISTICS-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C+1995::no title+FEIG D+J STATISTICAL SIMULA+1988::no title+FRANK I+TECHNOMETRICS+1993::no title+Hald, A.+Statistical Theory with Engineering Applications+1952::GENERALIZED ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS OF CORNISH-FISHER TYPE+HILL, GW; DAVIS, AW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1968::no title+HOERL A+TECHNOMETRICS+2000::Graphical methods for evaluating ridge regression estimator in mixture experiments+Jang, DH; Yoon, M+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1997::no title+JOHNSON SR+METROECONOMICA+1973::A simulation study of ridge regression and other regression estimators+Lawless, J.; Wang, P.+Communications in Statistics: Theory and Methods+1976::REGRESSION-ANALYSIS AND PROBLEMS OF MULTICOLLINEARITY+MASON, RL; GUNST, RF; WEBSTER, JT+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS+1975::GRAM-CHARLIER APPROXIMATIONS APPLIED TO T RATIOS OF K-CLASS ESTIMATORS+SARGAN, JD+ECONOMETRICA+1975::DOUBLE BOOTSTRAP FOR SHRINKAGE ESTIMATORS+VINOD, HD+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+AUG 1995"

Life test sampling plans for Weibull distributed lifetimes under accelerated hybrid censoring,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0233-9,MAY 2011,30,10,"Life test sampling plans (LSPs) for the Weibull distribution are usually developed under the assumptions that the shape parameter is known and the life test is conducted at an accelerated condition for which the acceleration factor (AF) is known. However, the sensitivities of a plan to the assumed shape parameter and AF have been rarely investigated. This paper considers the case where the life test is hybrid censored and develops attributes LSPs under the above assumptions. Then, sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the effects of the uncertainties in the assumed AF and shape parameter on the actual producer and consumer risks. A method is also developed for constructing LSPs that can accommodate these uncertainties.","Life test sampling plan,Hybrid censoring,Producer risk,Consumer risk,Acceleration factor","EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTIONS,FAILURE,PARAMETER,SIZE","Kim, Min@Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea::Yum, Bong-Jin@Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea","Kim, Min@Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)::Yum, Bong-Jin@Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)","Yum, Bong-Jin@C-1887-2011","Design of failure-censored accelerated life test sampling plans for lognormal and Weibull distributions+Bai, DS; Kim, JG; Chun, YR.+Eng Optim+1993::FAILURE-CENSORED ACCELERATED LIFE TEST SAMPLING PLANS FOR WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION UNDER EXPECTED TEST TIME CONSTRAINT+BAI, DS; CHUN, YR; KIM, JG+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+1995::Competing causes of failure and reliability tests for Weibull lifetimes under type I progressive censoring+Balasooriya, U; Low, CK+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+MAR 2004::Reliability sampling plans for the two-parameter exponential distribution under progressive censoring+Balasooriya, U; Saw, SLC+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+OCT 1998::Progressively censored reliability sampling plans for the Weibull distribution+Balasooriya, U; Saw, SLC; Gadag, V+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2000::Designing acceptance sampling schemes for life testing with mixed censoring+Chen, JW; Chou, WL; Wu, HL; et al.+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+JUN 2004::TRUNCATED LIFE TESTS IN THE EXPONENTIAL CASE+EPSTEIN, B+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1954::LIFE TESTING+EPSTEIN, B; SOBEL, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1953::LIFE-TEST SAMPLING PLANS FOR 2-PARAMETER WEIBULL POPULATIONS+FERTIG, KW; MANN, NR+TECHNOMETRICS+1980::SAMPLE SIZE FORMULAS FOR SOME BINOMIAL TYPE PROBLEMS+GUENTHER, WC+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::ACCELERATED LIFE TEST SAMPLING PLANS FOR EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTIONS+HSIEH, HK+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1994::TYPE-I CENSORED LIFE TEST PLANS IN THE EXPONENTIAL CASE+JEONG, HS; YUM, BJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1995::no title+Johnson, N.

To overcome this difficulty, Warner introduced randomized response techniques to estimate the proportion of people bearing such a stigmatizing or sensitive characteristic in a given community. For simplicity in estimation he restricted to SRSWR and since then, several researchers have extended and applied this technique in various ways. All these results involve sampling with a pre-fixed number of draws.

The model is nonlinear in the sense that between two successive change-points the regression function is nonlinear into respect to parameters. It is shown via Monte Carlo simulations that its performance is competitive with that of least absolute deviations estimator and it is more efficient than the least squares estimator, particularly in the presence of the outlier points. If the number of change-points is unknown, an estimation criterion for this number is proposed. Interest of this method is that the objective function is approximated by a differentiable function and if the model contains outliers, it detects correctly the location of the change-points.","Change-point,Parametric nonlinear model,SLAD estimator,Monte Carlo simulations","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR,SEGMENTED REGRESSION,LINEAR-MODELS,ASYMPTOTICS,NUMBER","Ciuperca, Gabriela@Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Inst Camille Jordan, UMR 5208, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Ciuperca, Gabriela@Universite Jean Monnet@Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite de Lyon (ComUE)@CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI)@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon@Ecole Centrale de Lyon",not exist,"STRONG REPRESENTATIONS FOR LAD ESTIMATORS IN LINEAR-MODELS+BABU, GJ+PROBABILITY THEORY AND RELATED FIELDS+1989::LEAST ABSOLUTE DEVIATION ESTIMATION OF A SHIFT+BAI, JS+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 1995::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::Estimation of multiple-regime regressions with least absolutes deviation+Bai, JS+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 1 1998::ASYMPTOTIC THEORY OF LEAST ABSOLUTE ERROR REGRESSION+BASSETT, G; KOENKER, R+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1978::Some aspects of change-point analysis+Bhattacharya, PK+CHANGE-POINT PROBLEMS+1994::no title+CIUPERCA G+ANN I STAT IN PRESS+2009::The M-estimation in a multi-phase random nonlinear model+Ciuperca, G.+Statistics and Probability Letters+2009::Maximum likelihood estimator in a multi-phase random regression model+Ciuperca, Gabriela; Dapzol, Nicolas+STATISTICS+2008::no title+DASGUPTA M+1781 MPRA+2007::Least absolute value regression: recent contributions+Dielman, TE+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+APR 2005::ASYMPTOTIC DISTRIBUTION THEORY IN SEGMENTED REGRESSION PROBLEMS-IDENTIFIED CASE+FEDER, PI+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1975::LOG LIKELIHOOD RATIO IN SEGMENTED REGRESSION+FEDER, PI+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1975::Calculation Method for Nonlinear Dynamic Least-Absolute Deviations Estimator+Kagihara, M.; Hitomi, K.+Journal of the Japan Statistical Society+2001::Asymptotic properties of non-linear least absolute deviation estimators+Kim, H.

A simply adjusted empirical log-likelihood ratio for the vector of density-weighted average derivatives is defined and its limiting distribution is shown to be a standard Chi-square distribution. To increase the accuracy and coverage probability of confidence regions, an EL inference procedure for the rescaled parameter vector is proposed by using a linear instrumental variables regression. The new method shares the same properties of the regular EL method with i.i.d. samples. For example, estimation of limiting variances and covariances is not needed.

Symmetry of functions and exchangeability of random variables,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0195-3,FEB 2011,13,7,"We present a new approach for measuring the degree of exchangeability of two continuous, identically distributed random variables or, equivalently, the degree of symmetry of their corresponding copula. While the opposite of exchangeability does not exist in probability theory, the contrary of symmetry is quite obvious from an analytical point of view. Therefore, leaving the framework of probability theory, we introduce a natural measure of symmetry for bivariate functions in an arbitrary normed function space. Restricted to the set of copulas this yields a general concept for measures of (non-)exchangeability of random variables. The fact that copulas are never antisymmetric leads to the notion of maximal degree of antisymmetry of copulas. We illustrate our approach by various norms on function spaces, most notably the Sobolev norm for copulas.","Copula,Exchangeability,Symmetry,Sobolev space",COPULAS,"Siburg, Karl Friedrich@Tech Univ Dortmund, Fak Math, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany::Stoimenov, Pavel A.@Tech Univ Dortmund, Fak Stat, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany","Siburg, Karl Friedrich@Dortmund University of Technology::Stoimenov, Pavel A.@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"Norms for copulas+Darsow, F.W.; Olsen, E.T.+Internat.

Mutual information and redundancy for categorical data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0196-x,FEB 2011,23,4,"Most methods for describing the relationship among random variables require specific probability distributions and some assumptions concerning random variables. Mutual information, based on entropy to measure the dependency among random variables, does not need any specific distribution and assumptions. Redundancy, which is an analogous version of mutual information, is also proposed as a method. In this paper, the concepts of redundancy and mutual information are explored as applied to multi-dimensional categorical data. We found that mutual information and redundancy for categorical data can be expressed as a function of the generalized likelihood ratio statistic under several kinds of independent log-linear models. As a consequence, mutual information and redundancy can also be used to analyze contingency tables stochastically. Whereas the generalized likelihood ratio statistic to test the goodness-of-fit of the log-linear models is sensitive to the sample size, the redundancy for categorical data does not depend on sample size but depends on its cell probabilities.","Entropy,Goodness of fit,Independence,Log-linear model","THEORETIC FUNCTIONALS,TIME-SERIES,ENTROPY,ASSOCIATION,ATTRIBUTES","Hong, Chong Sun@Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 110745, South Korea::Kim, Beom Jun@Korea Ratings, Risk Management, Seoul 150737, South Korea","Hong, Chong Sun@Sungkyunkwan University::Kim, Beom Jun@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Abramson, N.+Information Theory and Coding+1963::no title+Agresti, A.+An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis+1996::no title+Bishop, Yvonne M.

Tests of symmetry with one-sided alternatives in three-way contingency tables,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0198-8,FEB 2011,13,1,"For a two-dimensional contingency table of probabilities, the concept of symmetry around the main diagonal is well defined. Statistical hypothesis test of symmetry versus positive bias have also been explored. For tables of higher (three or more) dimensions, however, different concepts of symmetry are available. In this study, we consider statistical inference procedures of symmetry in partial tables versus various biases in three-dimensional tables.

Bayesian estimation for the exponentiated Weibull model under Type II progressive censoring,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0203-2,FEB 2011,14,32,"Based on progressive Type II censored samples, we have derived the maximum likelihood and Bayes estimators for the two shape parameters and the reliability function of the exponentiated Weibull lifetime model. We obtained Bayes estimators using both the symmetric and asymmetric loss functions via squared error loss and linex loss functions. This was done with respect to the conjugate priors for two shape parameters. We used an approximation based on the Lindley (Trabajos de Stadistca 21, 223-237, 1980) method for obtaining Bayes estimates under these loss functions. We made comparisons between these estimators and the maximum likelihood estimators using a Monte Carlo simulation study.","Bayesian estimation,Exponentiated Weibull distribution,Linex loss function,Lindley approximation,Maximum likelihood estimator,Progressive Type II censoring,Squared error loss function","FAMILY,PARAMETERS,SAMPLES,LIFE","Kim, Chansoo@Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Appl Math, Kong Ju 314701, South Korea::Jung, Jinhyouk@Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Pusan 609735, South Korea::Chung, Younshik@Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Pusan 609735, South Korea","Kim, Chansoo@Kongju National University::Jung, Jinhyouk@Pusan National University::Chung, Younshik@Pusan National University","Jung, Jinhyouk@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2352-2680","no title+AGGARWALA R+HDB STAT+2001::A SIMPLE SIMULATIONAL ALGORITHM FOR GENERATING PROGRESSIVE TYPE-II CENSORED SAMPLES+BALAKRISHNAN, N; SANDHU, RA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1995::PROGRESSIVELY CENSORED SAMPLES IN LIFE TESTING+COHEN, AC+TECHNOMETRICS+1963::The exponentiated Weibull family: A graphical approach+Jiang, R; Murthy, DNP+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+MAR 1999::no title+LINDLEY DV+TRABAJOS ESTADISTICA+1980::BEST LINEAR INVARIANT ESTIMATION FOR WEIBULL PARAMETERS UNDER PROGRESSIVE CENSORING+MANN, NR+TECHNOMETRICS+1971::The exponentiated Weibull family: Some properties and a flood data application+Mudholkar, GS; Hutson, AD+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1996::EXPONENTIATED WEIBULL FAMILY FOR ANALYZING BATHTUB FAILURE-RATE DATA+MUDHOLKAR, GS; SRIVASTAVA, DK+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+JUN 1993::THE EXPONENTIATED WEIBULL FAMILY - A REANALYSIS OF THE BUS-MOTOR-FAILURE DATA+MUDHOLKAR, GS; SRIVASTAVA, DK; FREIMER, M+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1995::Bayesian estimation for the exponentiated Weibull model+Nassar, MM; Eissa, FH+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+OCT 2004::On the exponentiated Weibull distribution+Nassar, MM; Eissa, FH+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2003::no title+Varian, H.

"Data augmentation, frequentist estimation, and the Bayesian analysis of multinomial logit models",STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0205-0,FEB 2011,51,14,"This article describes a convenient method of selecting Metropolis- Hastings proposal distributions for multinomial logit models. There are two key ideas involved. The first is that multinomial logit models have a latent variable representation similar to that exploited by Albert and Chib (J Am Stat Assoc 88:669-679, 1993) for probit regression. Augmenting the latent variables replaces the multinomial logit likelihood function with the complete data likelihood for a linear model with extreme value errors. While no conjugate prior is available for this model, a least squares estimate of the parameters is easily obtained. The asymptotic sampling distribution of the least squares estimate is Gaussian with known variance. The second key idea in this paper is to generate a Metropolis-Hastings proposal distribution by conditioning on the estimator instead of the full data set. The resulting sampler has many of the benefits of so-called tailored or approximation Metropolis-Hastings samplers. However, because the proposal distributions are available in closed form they can be implemented without numerical methods for exploring the posterior distribution. The algorithm converges geometrically ergodically, its computational burden is minor, and it requires minimal user input. Improvements to the sampler's mixing rate are investigated. The algorithm is also applied to partial credit models describing ordinal item response data from the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress. Its application to hierarchical models and Poisson regression are briefly discussed.","Multinomial Poisson transformation,Discrete choice model,Partial credit model,Markov chain Monte Carlo,Gibbs sampler,Metropolis-Hastings,Logistic regression,Polytomous,Polychotomous","CHAIN MONTE-CARLO,POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS,COVARIANCE STRUCTURE,LOGISTIC-MODELS,GIBBS SAMPLER,MARKOV-CHAINS,EM ALGORITHM,CONVERGENCE,LIKELIHOOD,HASTINGS","Scott, Steven L.@Unknow","Scott, Steven L.@Unknow",not exist,"A generalized additive model for discrete-choice data+Abe, M+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1999::no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical data analysis+1990::BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION OF NORMAL OGIVE ITEM RESPONSE CURVES USING GIBBS SAMPLING+ALBERT, JH+JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS+FAL 1992::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS OF BINARY AND POLYCHOTOMOUS RESPONSE DATA+ALBERT, JH; CHIB, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1993::no title+ALLEN NL+2001509 NCES US DEP+2000::THE MULTINOMIAL-POISSON TRANSFORMATION+BAKER, SG+STATISTICIAN+1994::Modeling covariance matrices in terms of standard deviations and correlations, with application to shrinkage+Barnard, J; McCulloch, R; Meng, XL+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2000::A Bayesian random effects model for testlets+Bradlow, ET; Wainer, H; Wang, XH+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JUN 1999::A note on the estimation of the multinomial logit model with random effects+Chen, Z; Kuo, L+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 2001::UNDERSTANDING THE METROPOLIS-HASTINGS ALGORITHM+CHIB, S; GREENBERG, E+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1995::no title+Cox, DR; Oakes, D.+Analysis of Survival Data+1984::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Test let response theory: An analog for the 3PL model useful in testlet-based adaptive testing+Du, Z.; Wainer, H.; Bradlow, E.

He restricted applying his randomized response device to gather data on sensitive issues from respondents chosen by simple random sampling with replacement (SRSWR). It has spawned numerous ramifications. We present results for the situation where the distinct persons chosen in an SRSWR are identified but each one independently gives a randomized response by Warner's device, repeated as many times as he/she is selected.

The two-sample t test: pre-testing its assumptions does not pay off,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0224-x,FEB 2011,13,39,"Traditionally, when applying the two-sample t test, some pre-testing occurs. That is, the theory-based assumptions of normal distributions as well as of homogeneity of the variances are often tested in applied sciences in advance of the tried-for t test. But this paper shows that such pre-testing leads to unknown final type-I- and type-II-risks if the respective statistical tests are performed using the same set of observations. In order to get an impression of the extension of the resulting misinterpreted risks, some theoretical deductions are given and, in particular, a systematic simulation study is done. As a result, we propose that it is preferable to apply no pre-tests for the t test and no t test at all, but instead to use the Welch-test as a standard test: its power comes close to that of the t test when the variances are homogeneous, and for unequal variances and skewness values vertical bar gamma (1)vertical bar < 3, it keeps the so called 20% robustness whereas the t test as well as Wilcoxon's U test cannot be recommended for most cases.","Pre-tests,Two-sample t test,Welch-test,Wilcoxon-U test",,"Rasch, Dieter@Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Inst Appl Stat & Comp, Vienna, Austria::Kubinger, Klaus D.@Univ Vienna, Div Psychol Assessment & Appl Psychometr, Fac Psychol, Vienna, Austria::Moder, Karl@Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Inst Appl Stat & Comp, Vienna, Austria","Rasch, Dieter@University of Bodenkultur Wien::Kubinger, Klaus D.@University of Vienna::Moder, Karl@University of Bodenkultur Wien",not exist,"The effect of preliminary normality goodness of fit tests on subsequent inference+Easterling, R.G.; Anderson, H.E.+Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation+1978::METHOD FOR SIMULATING NON-NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+FLEISHMAN, AI+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1978::Sulla determinazione empirica di una legge di distribuzione+Kolmogorov, A.+Inst.

This model receives much attention in international macroeconomics as it has been successfully applied to a variety of financial time series. The new test is build upon the nonstandard testing approach of Abadir and Distaso (J Econom 140:695-718, 2007) who introduce a class of modified statistics for testing joint hypotheses when one of the alternatives is one-sided. The asymptotic properties of the suggested unit root test are derived. In a Monte Carlo study the popular Dickey-Fuller-type test proposed by Kapetanios et al. (J Econom 112:359-379, 2003) is compared to the new test. The results suggest that the new test is generally superior in terms of power.

Inference on effect size indices from several two-armed experiments,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0165-9,DEC 2010,12,1,"The statistical inference problem on effect size indices is addressed using a series of independent two-armed experiments from k arbitrary populations. The effect size parameter simply quantifies the difference between two groups. It is a meaningful index to be used when data are measured on different scales. In the context of bivariate statistical models, we define estimators of the effect size indices and propose large sample testing procedures to test the homogeneity of these indices. The null and non-null distributions of the proposed testing procedures are derived and their performance is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation. Further, three types of interval estimation of the proposed indices are considered for both combined and uncombined data. Lower and upper confidence limits for the actual effect size indices are obtained and compared via bootstrapping. It is found that the length of the intervals based on the combined effect size estimator are almost half the length of the intervals based on the uncombined effect size estimators. Finally, we illustrate the proposed procedures for hypothesis testing and interval estimation using a real data set.","Effect size indices,Two-armed experiments,Testing and interval estimation,Large-sample properties,Bootstrapping",,"BuHamra, Sana S.@Kuwait Univ, Dept Informat Sci, Safat 13060, Kuwait::Al-Kandari, Noriah M.@Kuwait Univ, Dept Stat & OR, Safat 13060, Kuwait::Ahmed, S.

Estimation of population product in presence of non-response in successive sampling,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0193-5,DEC 2010,20,13,The design of this paper is to examine the problem of estimation of finite population product in mail surveys for the current occasion in the context of sampling on two occasions is attempted when there is non-response on both the occasions. Estimators for the current occasion are derived as a particular case when there is non-response on first and second occasion only. The gain in efficiency of the proposed estimate over the direct estimate using no information gathered on the first occasion is computed. The proposed strategy has been compared with other estimators.

Linear statistical inference for global and local minimum variance portfolios,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0170-z,DEC 2010,31,9,"Traditional portfolio optimization has often been criticized for not taking estimation risk into account. Estimation risk is mainly driven by the parameter uncertainty regarding the expected asset returns rather than their variances and covariances. The global minimum variance portfolio has been advocated by many authors as an appropriate alternative to the tangential portfolio. This is because there are no expectations which have to be estimated and thus the impact of estimation errors can be substantially reduced. However, in many practical situations an investor is not willing to choose the global minimum variance portfolio but he wants to minimize the variance of the portfolio return under specific constraints for the portfolio weights. Such a portfolio is called local minimum variance portfolio. Small-sample hypothesis tests for global and local minimum variance portfolios are derived and the exact distributions of the estimated portfolio weights are calculated in the present work. The first two moments of the estimator for the expected portfolio returns are also provided and the presented instruments are illustrated by an empirical study.","Estimation risk,Linear regression theory,Markowitz portfolio,Minimum variance portfolio,Portfolio optimization,Top down investment","ESTIMATION RISK,CONSTRAINTS,SELECTION,WEIGHTS,CHOICE,PERFORMANCE,INEQUALITY,IMPROVE,MODEL","Frahm, Gabriel@Univ Cologne, Dept Econ & Social Stat, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Frahm, Gabriel@University of Cologne",not exist,"Global portfolio optimization+Black, F.; Litterman, R.+Financial Analysts Journal+1992::The sampling error in estimates of mean-variance efficient portfolio weights+Britten-Jones, M+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+APR 1999::THE EFFECT OF ERRORS IN MEANS, VARIANCES, AND COVARIANCES ON OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO CHOICE+CHOPRA, VK; ZIEMBA, WT+JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT+WIN 1993::Using constraints to improve the robustness of asset allocation+Eichhorn, D; Gupta, F; Stubbs, E+JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT+SPR 1998::Testing for the best alternative with an application to performance measurement+Frahm, G.+Discussion Paper+2007::AN EMPIRICAL BAYES APPROACH TO EFFICIENT PORTFOLIO SELECTION+FROST, PA; SAVARINO, JE+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS+SEP 1986::FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE - CONSTRAIN PORTFOLIO WEIGHTS+FROST, PA; SAVARINO, JE+JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT+FAL 1988::Exact inference in the inequality constrained normal linear regression model+Geweke, J.+Journal of Applied Econometrics+1986::LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST, WALD TEST, AND KUHN-TUCKER TEST IN LINEAR-MODELS WITH INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS ON THE REGRESSION PARAMETERS+GOURIEROUX, C; HOLLY, A; MONFORT, A+ECONOMETRICA+1982::Do constraints improve portfolio performance?+Grauer, RR; Shen, FC+JOURNAL OF BANKING &amp; FINANCE+AUG 2000::WHEN WILL MEAN-VARIANCE EFFICIENT PORTFOLIOS BE WELL DIVERSIFIED+GREEN, RC; HOLLIFIELD, B+JOURNAL OF FINANCE+DEC 1992::no title+Greene, W.

The symmetrical errors distribution class includes all symmetrical continuous distributions, such as normal, Student-t, power exponential, logistic I and II, contaminated normal, so on. First, score test statistics and their adjustment forms of heteroscedasticity are derived. Then, the asymptotic properties, including asymptotic chi-square and approximate powers under local alternatives of the score tests, are studied. The properties of test statistics are investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, a real data set is used to illustrate our test methods.","Symmetrical distributions,Nonlinear model,AR(1) errors,Heteroscedasticity,Score test,Asymptotic properties,Approximate local powers","GAUSSIAN REGRESSION-MODELS,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,SAMPLE-SIZE,VARYING DISPERSION,T-DISTRIBUTION,SCORE TESTS,POWER,EM","Cao, Chun-Zheng@Southeast Univ, Dept Math, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China@Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Math & Phys, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China::Lin, Jin-Guan@Southeast Univ, Dept Math, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China::Zhu, Li-Xing@Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Cao, Chun-Zheng@Southeast University - China::Lin, Jin-Guan@Southeast University - China::Zhu, Li-Xing@Hong Kong Baptist University","HKBU, Mathematics@B-5086-2009::Zhu, Lixing@B-7199-2009::Zhu, Lixing@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1611-4267","Second-order asymptotics for score tests in heteroskedastic t regression models+Barroso, LP; Cordeiro, GM; Vasconcellos, KLP+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2002::no title+Bates, D.M.; Watts, D.B.+Nonlinear Regression Analysis and Its Applications+1988::SCORE TESTS FOR REGRESSION-MODELS+CHEN, CF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1983::DIAGNOSTICS FOR HETEROSCEDASTICITY IN REGRESSION+COOK, RD; WEISBERG, S+BIOMETRIKA+1983::Corrected maximum-likelihood estimation in a class of symmetric nonlinear regression models+Cordeiro, GM; Ferrari, SLP; Uribe-Opazo, MA; et al.+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 15 2000::no title+COX, D.

An alternative multivariate skew Laplace distribution: properties and estimation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0183-7,DEC 2010,38,15,"A special case of the multivariate exponential power distribution is considered as a multivariate extension of the univariate symmetric Laplace distribution. In this paper, we focus on this multivariate symmetric Laplace distribution, and extend it to a multivariate skew distribution. We call this skew extension of the multivariate symmetric Laplace distribution the ""multivariate skew Laplace (MSL) distribution"" to distinguish between the asymmetric multivariate Laplace distribution proposed by Kozubowski and Podgrski (Comput Stat 15:531-540, 2000a) Kotz et al. (The Laplace distribution and generalizations: a revisit with applications to communications, economics, engineering, and finance, Chap. 6. Birkhauser, Boston, 2001) and Kotz et al. (An asymmetric multivariate Laplace Distribution, Working paper, 2003). One of the advantages of (MSL) distribution is that it can handle both heavy tails and skewness and that it has a simple form compared to other multivariate skew distributions. Some fundamental properties of the multivariate skew Laplace distribution are discussed. A simple EM-based maximum likelihood estimation procedure to estimate the parameters of the multivariate skew Laplace distribution is given. Some examples are provided to demonstrate the modeling strength of the skew Laplace distribution.","Normal variance-mean mixture distribution,Heavy tailed distribution,Laplace distribution,Robust estimation,Skewed distribution","KOTZ-TYPE DISTRIBUTION,STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,ROBUST,MIXTURES","Arslan, Olcay@Cukurova Univ, Dept Stat, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey","Arslan, Olcay@Cukurova University","Arslan, Olcay@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7067-4997","A MULTIVARIATE LINNIK DISTRIBUTION+ANDERSON, DN+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUL 17 1992::no title+ARSLAN O+STATISTICS IN PRESS+2009::The multivariate skew-normal distribution+Azzalini, A; DallaValle, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::Distributions generated by perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on a multivariate skew t-distribution+Azzalini, A; Capitanio, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2003::Robust likelihood methods based on the skew-t and related distributions+Azzalini, Adelchi; Genton, Marc G.+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2008::NORMAL VARIANCE MEAN MIXTURES AND Z-DISTRIBUTIONS+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O; KENT, J; SORENSEN, M+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1982::EXPONENTIALLY DECREASING DISTRIBUTIONS FOR LOGARITHM OF PARTICLE-SIZE+BARNDORFFNIELSEN, O+PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES+1977::THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL HYPERBOLIC DISTRIBUTION AND RELATED DISTRIBUTIONS, WITH AN APPLICATION TO JOHANNSEN BEAN DATA+BLAESILD, P+BIOMETRIKA+1981::no title+BLAESILD P+GEN HYPERBOLIC GENER+1999::ROBUST AND PARTIALLY ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION OF REGRESSION-MODELS+BUTLER, RJ; MCDONALD, JB; NELSON, RD; et al.+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 1990::no title+DEVROYE L+ACM T MODEL COMPUT S+1997::Inferential aspects of the skew exponential power distribution+DiCiccio, TJ; Monti, AC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2004::A multivariate generalized Laplace distribution+Ernst, MD+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+1998::no title+Fang, K.; Kotz, S.; Ng, K.+Symmetric Multivariate and Related Distributions+1990::no title+Genton, M.

Modeling heterogeneity for bivariate survival data by the Weibull distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0188-2,DEC 2010,24,3,"We propose bivariate Weibull regression model with heterogeneity (frailty or random effect) which is generated by Weibull distribution. We assume that the bivariate survival data follow bivariate Weibull of Hanagal (Econ Qual Control 19:83-90, 2004). There are some interesting situations like survival times in genetic epidemiology, dental implants of patients and twin births (both monozygotic and dizygotic) where genetic behavior (which is unknown and random) of patients follows a known frailty distribution. These are the situations which motivate to study this particular model. We propose two-stage maximum likelihood estimation for hierarchical likelihood in the proposed model. We present a small simulation study to compare these estimates with the true value of the parameters and it is observed that these estimates are very close to the true values of the parameters.","Bivariate Weibull,Frailty,Heterogeneity,Parametric regression,Survival times","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION,REML ESTIMATION,MIXED MODELS,INFERENCE,FRAILTY,FREUND","Hanagal, David D.@Univ Pune, Dept Stat, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India","Hanagal, David D.@University of Pune",not exist,"no title+BONENG YT+THESIS U GUELPH+2001::APPROXIMATE INFERENCE IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS+BRESLOW, NE; CLAYTON, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::MODEL FOR ASSOCIATION IN BIVARIATE LIFE TABLES AND ITS APPLICATION IN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL-STUDIES OF FAMILIAL TENDENCY IN CHRONIC DISEASE INCIDENCE+CLAYTON, DG+BIOMETRIKA+1978::RESTRICTED MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD (REML) ESTIMATION OF VARIANCE COMPONENTS IN MIXED MODEL+CORBEIL, RR; SEARLE, SR+TECHNOMETRICS+1976::A BIVARIATE EXTENSION OF EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION+FREUND, JE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1961::no title+Green, P.

Synthetic and composite estimation under a superpopulation model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0136-1,SEP 2010,10,2,"Under a simple superpopulation model for an arbitrary sampling design we derive optimal linear unbiased estimators/predictors of a mean in a domain. They can be viewed as synthetic and composite estimators of small area estimation theory when no auxiliary variable is available. Moreover, we show that the only requirement for optimality of a sampling strategy is to use any sampling plan of fixed sample size together with traditional estimators (as designed for simple random sampling without replacement). Finally, for symmetric sampling plans, simplified formulas (based on the first two moments of sample sizes) for optimal synthetic and composite estimators and their MSE's are derived.

As a loss associated with estimation we introduce a generalized LINEX loss function. We construct a sequential procedure possessing some asymptotically optimal properties in the case when p tends to zero. In this approach to the problem, the conditions are given, under which the stopping time is asymptotically efficient and normal, and the corresponding sequential estimator is asymptotically normal. The procedure constructed guarantees that its sequential risk is asymptotically equal to a prescribed constant.","Sequential procedure,Stopping rule,Asymptotic optimality of sequential procedures,Bernoulli trials,Probability of success,LINEX loss function",,"Baran, Jerzy@Wroclaw Univ Technol, Inst Math & Comp Sci, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland::Magiera, Ryszard@Wroclaw Univ Technol, Inst Math & Comp Sci, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland","Baran, Jerzy@Wroclaw University of Science & Technology::Magiera, Ryszard@Wroclaw University of Science & Technology",not exist,"BAYESIAN SEQUENTIAL ESTIMATION+ALVO, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1977::A MODIFICATION OF THE SEQUENTIAL PROBABILITY RATIO TEST TO REDUCE THE SAMPLE-SIZE+ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1960::The asymptotic minimax risk for the estimation of constrained binomial and multinomial probabilities+Braess, D.; Dette, H.+Sankhya, Indian J.

Life expectancy of a bathtub shaped failure distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0148-x,SEP 2010,21,2,"The mean residual life (MRL), or ""life expectancy"", encapsulates the entire residual life of the product, and is thus of great interest in many fields, particularly those concerned with warranties, replacement policies, burn-in, and insurance. Estimating the profile of the MRL, let alone constructing confidence bands for it, is a difficult problem. We explore several approaches to estimating the variation in the profile of the mean residual life function, with special attention to a bathtub shaped failure distribution, called the modified Weibull distribution, which has generated considerable interest in reliability engineering. Parametric and non-parametric confidence bands are compared, and the theoretical coverage probabilities verified by simulation. An example application investigating the effectiveness of repairs is given, and possible further research discussed.","Reliability,Modified Weibull distribution,Parametric estimation,Non-parametric estimation","MEAN RESIDUAL LIFE,BURN-IN,VITALITY FUNCTION,HAZARD RATE,ESTIMATOR,MODELS","Bebbington, Mark@Massey Univ, Inst Fundamental Sci, Palmerston North, New Zealand::Lai, Chin-Diew@Massey Univ, Inst Fundamental Sci, Palmerston North, New Zealand::Zitikis, Ricardas@Univ Western Ontario, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Bebbington, Mark@Massey University::Lai, Chin-Diew@Massey University::Zitikis, Ricardas@Western University (University of Western Ontario)","Bebbington, Mark@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3504-7418","HOW TO IDENTIFY A BATHTUB HAZARD RATE+AARSET, MV+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+APR 1987::Uniform asymptotics in the empirical mean residual life process+Bae, JS; Kim, SY+JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY+MAR 2006::Useful periods for lifetime distributions with bathtub shaped hazard rate functions+Bebbington, M; Lai, CD; Zitikis, R+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+JUN 2006::Reduction in mean residual life in the presence of a constant competing risk+Bebbington, Mark; Lai, Chin-Diew; Zitikis, Ricardas+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY+JAN-FEB 2008::Bathtub-type curves in reliability and beyond+Bebbington, Mark; Lai, Chin-Diew; Zitikis, Ricardas+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+SEP 2007::Estimating the turning point of a bathtub-shaped failure distribution+Bebbington, Mark; Lai, Chin-Diew; Zitikis, Ricardas+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+APR 1 2008::Optimum burn-in time for a bathtub shaped failure distribution+Bebbington, Mark; Lai, Chin-Diew; Zitikis, Ricardas+METHODOLOGY AND COMPUTING IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+MAR 2007::Shape and crossing properties of mean residual life functions+Bekker, L; Mi, J+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+SEP 15 2003::A criterion for burn-in that balances mean residual life and residual variance+Block, HW; Savits, TH; Singh, H+OPERATIONS RESEARCH+MAR-APR 2002::Burn-in+Block, HW; Savits, TH+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+FEB 1997::Limiting behaviour of the mean residual life+Bradley, DM; Gupta, RC+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 2003::Nonparametric estimator for mean residual life and vitality function+Guillamon, A; Navarro, J; Ruiz, JM+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUL 1998::Representing the mean residual life in terms of the failure rate+Gupta, RC; Bradley, DM+MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING+JUN 2003::no title+Lai, C; Xie, M.+Stochastic ageing and dependence for reliability+2006::A modified Weibull distribution+Lai, CD; Xie, M; Murthy, DNP+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+MAR 2003::BURN-IN MODELS AND METHODS - A REVIEW+LEEMIS, LM; BENEKE, M+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1990::Consistent testing for stochastic dominance under general sampling+Linton, O; Maasoumi, E; Whang, Y+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+JUL 2005::A general approach to the shape of failure rate and MRL functions+Mi, J+NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS+JUN 2004::How to obtain bathtub-shaped failure rate models from normal mixtures+Navarro, J; Hernandez, PJ+PROBABILITY IN THE ENGINEERING AND INFORMATIONAL SCIENCES+2004::Modeling the failure data of a repairable equipment with bathtub type failure intensity+Pulcini, G+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+FEB 2001::Nonparametric recursive estimator for mean residual life and vitality function under dependence conditions+Ruiz, JM; Guillamon, A+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1996"
Eliciting vague but proper maximal entropy priors in Bayesian experiments,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0149-9,SEP 2010,65,2,"Priors elicited according to maximal entropy rules have been used for years in objective and subjective Bayesian analysis. However, when the prior knowledge remains fuzzy or dubious, they often suffer from impropriety which can make them uncomfortable to use. In this article we suggest the formal elicitation of an encompassing family for the standard maximal entropy (ME) priors and the maximal data information (MDI) priors, which can lead to obtain proper families. An interpretation is given in the objective framework of channel coding. In a subjective framework, the performance of the method is shown in a reliability context when flat but proper priors are elicited for the Weibull lifetime distributions. Such priors appear as practical tools for sensitivity studies.","Bayesian inference,Expert opinion,Kullback-Leibler distance,Shannon's entropy,Noninformative priors,Channel coding,Sensitivity study,Weibull","WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION,MATHEMATICAL-THEORY,INVERSE PROBLEMS,INFORMATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,INFERENCE,COMMUNICATION,RELIABILITY,UNCERTAINTY,MODELS","Bousquet, Nicolas@Univ Laval, Dept Math & Stat, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada","Bousquet, Nicolas@Laval University",not exist,"no title+ANDRIEU C+NONLINEAR NONGAUSSIA+2001::Idee E+Bacha, M.; Celeux, G.; Lannoy, A.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Vasseur, D</span>.+Estimation de modeles de durees de vie fortement censurees+1998::Nonparametric entropy estimation: an overview+Beirlant, J; Dudewicz, EJ; Gyorfi, L<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; van der Meulen, EC</span>.+Int J Math Stat Sci+1997::no title+Berger, J.+Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis+1985::The Case for Objective Bayesian Analysis+Berger, James+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2006::BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS FOR THE POLY-WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION+BERGER, JO; SUN, DC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1993::On the Development of Reference Priors+Bernardo, J.

Statistical inference for fixed-effects partially linear regression models with errors in variables,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0150-3,SEP 2010,25,7,"Fixed-effects partially linear regression models are useful tools to analyze data from economic, genetic and other fields. In this paper, we consider estimation and inference procedures when some of the covariates are measured with errors. The previously proposed estimations, including difference-based series estimation (Baltagi and Li in Ann Econ Finan 3:103--116, 2002) and profile least squares estimation (Fan et al. in J Am Stat Assoc 100:781--813, 2005) are no longer consistent because of the attenuation. We propose a new estimation by taking the measurement errors into account. Our proposed estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Consistent estimations of the error variance are also developed. In addition, we propose a variable-selection procedure to variable selection in the parametric part. The procedure is an extension of the nonconcave penalized likelihood (Fan and Li in J Am Stat Assoc 85:1348--1360, 2001), which simultaneously selects the important variables and estimates the unknown parameters. The resulting estimate is shown to possess an oracle property. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed procedures.","Fixed effect,Partially linear,Measurement errors,Profile least squares,Variable selection",,"Zhou, Haibo@Univ N Carolina, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA::You, Jinhong@Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Stat, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China::Zhou, Bin@E China Normal Univ, Sch Finance & Stat, Dept Management & Insurance, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China","Zhou, Haibo@University of North Carolina@University of North Carolina Chapel Hill::You, Jinhong@Shanghai University of Finance & Economics::Zhou, Bin@East China Normal University",not exist,"Estimation of linear panel data models using GMM+Ahn, S.C.; Schmidt, P.+Generalized Method of Moments Estimation+2000::NONPARAMETRIC KERNEL ESTIMATION FOR SEMIPARAMETRIC MODELS+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+AUG 1995::Regularization of wavelet approximations+Antoniadis, A; Fan, JQ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2001::Series estimation of partially linear panel data models with fixed effects+Baltagi, B.

Simulation study of new estimators combining the SUR ridge regression and the restricted least squares methodologies,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0151-2,SEP 2010,23,4,"In this paper, we propose two SUR type estimators based on combining the SUR ridge regression and the restricted least squares methods.

The study has been made using MonteCarlo techniques, (1,000 replications), under certain conditions where a number of factors that may effect their performance have been varied. The performance of the proposed and some of the existing estimators are evaluated by means of the TMSE and the PR criteria. Our results indicate that the proposed SUR restricted ridge estimators based on K-SUR, K-Sratio, K-Mratio and K produced smaller TMSE and/or PR values than the remaining estimators. In contrast with other ridge estimators, components of K are defined in terms of the eigenvalues of X*' X* and all lie in the open interval (0, 1).","Multicollinearity,Restricted generalized least squares estimator,SUR restricted ridge estimator,Liu estimator,Biased estimator,Monte Carlo simulation","NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS,PARAMETERS,MODELS","Alkhamisi, M.

Moreover we assume that the range of values of X is subdivided into k classes and the sampling data come out from a two stage stratified sampling. The main purpose of the work is to determine the estimators, as well as their asymptotic distribution, of the partial means of classes, each of them is defined as a non linear function of the other parameters. Particularly, we are interested in determining the linear approximation estimators and, under convergence theorems, the asymptotic distribution. Afterwards we define the estimator of the vector of the partial means of classes and its asymptotic convergence to multivariate normal distribution is determined. These results are useful to develop simultaneous inferential procedures.","Asymptotic normality,Finite population,Linearization method,Two-stage stratified sampling",MULTINOMIAL PROPORTIONS,"Cozzucoli, Paolo C.@Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy","Cozzucoli, Paolo C.@University of Calabria",not exist,"no title+*BANC IT+B STAT S+2006::no title+Cochran, WG.+Sampling Techniques+1977::no title+COZZUCOLI P+QUAD STAT MAT APPL S+1993::no title+COZZUCOLI P+QUAD STAT MAT APPL S+1992::no title+Fuller, W.+INTRO STAT TIME SERI+1976::ON SIMULTANEOUS CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR MULTINOMIAL PROPORTIONS+GOODMAN, LA+TECHNOMETRICS+1965::INFERENCE FROM STRATIFIED SAMPLES - PROPERTIES OF THE LINEARIZATION, JACKKNIFE AND BALANCED REPEATED REPLICATION METHODS+KREWSKI, D; RAO, JNK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::no title+LATORRE G+QUAD STAT MAT APPL S+1992::no title+LATORRE G+QUAD STAT MAT APPL S+1991::no title+LATORRE G+RES EC INEQUAL+1995::no title+Miller, R.+Simultaneous statistical inference+1981::no title+MONFORT A+COURS PROBABILITES+1980::LARGE SAMPLE SIMULTANEOUS CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR MULTINOMIAL PROPORTIONS+QUESENBERRY, CP; HURST, DC+TECHNOMETRICS+1964::no title+Rao, C.

Consistent estimation of regression coefficients in ultrastructural measurement error model using stochastic prior information,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0162-z,SEP 2010,26,6,"The problem of consistent estimation of regression coefficients in a multivariate linear ultrastructural measurement error model is considered in this article when some additional information on regression coefficients is available a priori. Such additional information is expressible in the form of stochastic linear restrictions. Utilizing stochastic restrictions given a priori, some methodologies are presented to obtain the consistent estimators of regression coefficients under two types of additional information separately, viz., covariance matrix of measurement errors and reliability matrix associated with explanatory variables. The measurement errors are assumed to be not necessarily normally distributed. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are derived and analyzed analytically as well as numerically through a Monte Carlo simulation experiment.","Consistent estimation,Measurement errors,Reliability matrix,Stochastic linear restriction,Ultrastructural model",LEAST-SQUARES,"Shalabh@Indian Inst Technol, Dept Math & Stat, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India::Garg, Gaurav@Jaypee Univ Informat Technol, Dept Math, Solan 173215, Himachal Prades, India::Misra, Neeraj@Indian Inst Technol, Dept Math & Stat, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India","Shalabh@Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System)@Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur::Garg, Gaurav@Jaypee University of Information Technology::Misra, Neeraj@Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System)@Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur",not exist,"no title+Cheng, C.; Van Ness, J.W.+Statistical Regression with Measurement Error+1999::Non-existence of the first moment of the adjusted least squares estimator in multivariate errors-in-variables model+Cheng, Chi-Lun; Kukush, Alexander+METRIKA+2006::ON THE UNREPLICATED ULTRASTRUCTURAL MODEL+CHENG, CL; VANNESS, JW+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1991::no title+de Gruijter, D.

Based on the likelihood ratio, the proposed life test plans are established so that the required producer and consumer risks can be satisfied simultaneously. The advantage of the proposed method is that the developed sampling procedure depends on the likelihood ratio only so that the method can be applied to any lifetime distribution when only one parameter is unknown. A numerical study is conducted and some of the sampling plans for the Weibull lifetime distribution with different shape parameters are tabulated for illustration. Moreover, the influence of the removal schemes on the proposed sampling plans is discussed.","Consumer risk,Life test plan,Likelihood ratio,Producer risk,Progressive interval censored test","LIFE TEST PLANS,EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION,WEIBULL PARAMETERS,GROUPED DATA,REMOVALS","Tsai, Tzong-Ru@Tamkang Univ, Dept Stat, Taipei 251, Taiwan::Lin, Chin-Wei@Tamkang Univ, Dept Stat, Taipei 251, Taiwan","Tsai, Tzong-Ru@Tamkang University::Lin, Chin-Wei@Tamkang University",not exist,"no title+Balakrishnan, N; Aggarwala, R.+Progressive Censoring: Theory, Methods, and Applications+2000::Confidence interval for the mean of the exponential distribution, based on grouped data+Chen, ZM; Mi, J+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+DEC 1996::ESTIMATION OF THE WEIBULL PARAMETERS WITH GROUPED DATA+CHENG, KF; CHEN, CH+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1988::PROGRESSIVELY CENSORED SAMPLING IN 3 PARAMETER LOG-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION+COHEN, AC+TECHNOMETRICS+1976::PROGRESSIVELY CENSORED SAMPLES IN LIFE TESTING+COHEN, AC+TECHNOMETRICS+1963::LIFE TESTING+EPSTEIN, B; SOBEL, M+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1953::TYPE-I CENSORED LIFE TEST PLANS IN THE EXPONENTIAL CASE+JEONG, HS; YUM, BJ+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1995::Comparisons of exponential life test plans with intermittent inspections+Kim, SH; Yum, BJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2000::BEST LINEAR INVARIANT ESTIMATION FOR WEIBULL PARAMETERS UNDER PROGRESSIVE CENSORING+MANN, NR+TECHNOMETRICS+1971::A TEST OF THE PARAMETER OF THE EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION IN THE TYPE-I CENSORING CASE+SPURRIER, JD; WEI, LJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1980::no title+STEINER SH+QUALITY CONTROL IMPR+1994::Acceptance sampling based on truncated life tests for generalized Rayleigh distribution+Tsai, Tzong-Ru; Wu, Shuo-Jye+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+JUL 2006::INTERVAL ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS OF LIFE FROM PROGRESSIVELY CENSORED-DATA+VIVEROS, R; BALAKRISHNAN, N+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1994::Statistical inference based on progressively censored samples with random removals from the Burr type XII distribution+Wu, Shuo-Jye; Chen, Yi-Ju; Chang, Chun-Tao+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+JAN 2007::Estimation for the two-parameter Pareto distribution under progressive censoring with uniform removals+Wu, SJ+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+FEB 2003"

A new stochastic mixed ridge estimator in linear regression model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0169-5,JUN 2010,17,27,"This paper is concerned with the parameter estimation in linear regression model with additional stochastic linear restrictions. To overcome the multicollinearity problem, a new stochastic mixed ridge estimator is proposed and its efficiency is discussed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the superiority of the stochastic mixed ridge estimator over the ridge estimator and the mixed estimator in the mean squared error matrix sense are derived for the two cases in which the parametric restrictions are correct and are not correct. Finally, a numerical example is also given to show the theoretical results.","Ordinary ridge estimator,Ordinary mixed estimator,Stochastic mixed ridge estimator,Mean squared error matrix","PRIOR INFORMATION,ERROR","Li, Yalian@Chongqing Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China::Yang, Hu@Chongqing Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China","Li, Yalian@Chongqing University::Yang, Hu@Chongqing University","Yang, Hu@A-8108-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6589-8534","Mean squared error matrix comparisons of some biased estimators in linear regression+Akdeniz, F; Erol, H+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2003::NONNEGATIVE AND POSITIVE DEFINITENESS OF MATRICES MODIFIED BY 2 MATRICES OF RANK ONE+BAKSALARY, JK; TRENKLER, G+LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS+JUN 1991::A NOTE ON REGRESSION WHEN THERE IS EXTRANEOUS INFORMATION ABOUT ONE OF THE COEFFICIENTS+DURBIN, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1953::FURTHER RESULTS ON MEAN-SQUARE ERROR OF RIDGE REGRESSION+FAREBROTHER, RW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1976::Restricted ridge estimation+Gross, E+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+OCT 15 2003::no title+Gruber, M.

The present paper carries out a simulation study of likelihood ratio, Wald and score tests for the parameter that distinguishes the extended distribution from the basic one, for the Weibull and exponential cases, allowing for right censored data. The likelihood ratio test is found to perform better than the others. The test is shown to have sufficient power to detect alternatives that correspond to interesting departures from the basic model and can be useful in modeling.","Weibull distribution,Marshall-Olkin extension,Proportional odds,Likelihood",CENSORED-DATA,"Caroni, Chrys@Natl Tech Univ Athens, Athens 15780, Greece","Caroni, Chrys@National Technical University of Athens",not exist,"Analysis of survival data by the proportional odds model.+Bennett, S+Statistics in medicine+1983 Apr-Jun::THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO, WALD, AND LAGRANGE MULTIPLIER TESTS - AN EXPOSITORY NOTE+BUSE, A+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1982::Parametric proportional odds frailty models+Economou, P.; Caroni, C.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2007::Marshall-Olkin extended Lomax distribution and its application to censored data+Ghitany, M.

A modified unrelated question randomized response device for complex surveys,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0182-8,JUN 2010,8,0,"Singh et al. (Stat Trans 6(4):515-522, 2003) proposed a modified unrelated question procedure and they also demonstrated that the modified procedure is capable of producing a more efficient estimator of the population parameter pi (A) , namely, the proportion of persons in a community bearing a sensitive character A when pi (A) < 0.50. The development of Singh et al. (Stat Trans 6(4):515-522, 2003) is based on simple random samples with replacement and on the assumption that pi (B) , namely, the proportion of individuals bearing an unrelated innocuous character B is known. Due to these limitations, Singh et al.'s (Stat Trans 6(4):515-522, 2003) procedure cannot be used in practical surveys where usually the sample units are chosen with varying selection probabilities. In this article, following Singh et al. (Stat Trans 6(4):515-522, 2003) we propose an alternative RR procedure assuming that the population units are sampled with unequal selection probabilities and that the value of pi (B) is unknown.

Also, an approximation based on the Laplace approximation (Tierney and Kadane in J Am Stat Assoc 81:82-86, 1986) and importance sampling methods are used for obtaining the Bayes estimator.

Bayesian regression analysis with linked data using mixture normal distributions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0208-x,JUN 2010,13,0,"The probabilistic uncertainty in record linkage affects statistical analysis such as regression analysis of linked data. This paper considers Bayesian regression analysis with linked data and shows that despite using the usual normal regression analysis, the least squares type estimators of regression coefficients are not always adequate. A method is proposed in which the distribution of the response variable is used. This method is related to finite mixture analysis and leads to more accurate estimations. A simple approach has been proposed to increase the tractability and reduce the number of mixture components.

Optimal progressive group-censoring plans for exponential distribution in presence of cost constraint,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0212-1,JUN 2010,27,10,"This article discusses a life test under progressive type-I group-censoring. We use maximum likelihood method to obtain the point and interval estimators of the parameter of lifetime distribution. In order to obtain a precise estimate of mean life, one needs to design an optimal life test. Thus, this article proposes an approach to determine the number of test units, number of inspections, and length of inspection interval of a life test under a pre-determined budget of experiment such that the asymptotic variance of estimator of mean life is minimum. The method will be applied to two numerical examples and the sensitivity analysis will be investigated.","Grouped data,Progressive censoring,Sensitivity analysis,Type-I censoring,Variance optimality","STEP-STRESS TEST,RANDOM REMOVALS,INTERVAL,LIFE,PARAMETERS,INFERENCE,MODEL","Wu, Shuo-Jye@Tamkang Univ, Dept Stat, Taipei 251, Taiwan::Huang, Syuan-Rong@Tamkang Univ, Grad Inst Management Sci, Taipei 251, Taiwan","Wu, Shuo-Jye@Tamkang University::Huang, Syuan-Rong@Tamkang University",not exist,"Progressive interval censoring: Some mathematical results with applications to inference+Aggarwala, R+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2001::no title+Balakrishnan, N; Aggarwala, R.+Progressive Censoring: Theory, Methods, and Applications+2000::Reliability sampling plans for the two-parameter exponential distribution under progressive censoring+Balasooriya, U; Saw, SLC+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+OCT 1998::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.

A note on Bayesian residuals as a hierarchical model diagnostic technique,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0111-2,JAN 2010,7,4,"When one wants to check a tentatively proposed model for departures that are not well specified, looking at residuals is the most common diagnostic technique. Here, we investigate the use of Bayesian standardized residuals to detect unknown hierarchical structure. Asymptotic theory, also supported by simulations, shows that the use of Bayesian standardized residuals is effective when the within group correlation, rho, is large. However, we show that standardized residuals may not detect hierarchical structure when rho is small. Thus, if it is important to detect modest hierarchical structure (i.e., rho small) one should use other diagnostic techniques in addition to the standardized residuals. We use ""quality of care"" data from the Patterns of Care Study, a two-stage cluster sample of patients undergoing radiation therapy for cervix cancer, to illustrate the potential use of these residuals to detect missing hierarchical structure.","Model assessment,Posterior predictive distribution,Q-Q plot,Hierarchical structure",,"Yan, Guofen@Univ Virginia, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA::Sedransk, J.@Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Stat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Yan, Guofen@University of Virginia::Sedransk, J.@Case Western Reserve University",not exist,"BAYESIAN AND FREQUENTIST PREDICTIVE INFERENCE FOR THE PATTERNS OF CARE STUDIES+CALVIN, JA; SEDRANSK, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1991::no title+Carlin, B.

Recently, alternative transformations emerged in the literature. Rayner and MacGillivray (Statist Comput 12:57-75, 2002b) discuss the GK distributions, where Tukey's H-transformation is replaced by another kurtosis transformation K. Similarly, Fischer and Klein (All Stat Arch, 88(1):35-50, 2004) advocate the J-transformation which also produces heavy tails but-in contrast to Tukey's H-transformation-still guarantees the existence of all moments. Within this work we present a very general kurtosis transformation which nests H-, K-and an approximation to the J-transformation and, hence, permits to discriminate between them. Applications to financial and teletraffic data are given.","Kurtosis transformation,H-transformation,Leptokurtosis","STOCK-RETURN DISTRIBUTIONS,ELONGATION,SKEWNESS","Fischer, Matthias@Unknow","Fischer, Matthias@Unknow",not exist,"no title+ALBOTA G+INVESTIGATION PARAME+2005::ON MEASURING SKEWNESS AND ELONGATION IN COMMON-STOCK RETURN DISTRIBUTIONS - THE CASE OF THE MARKET INDEX+BADRINATH, SG; CHATTERJEE, S+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+OCT 1988::A DATA-ANALYTIC LOOK AT SKEWNESS AND ELONGATION IN COMMON-STOCK-RETURN DISTRIBUTIONS+BADRINATH, SG; CHATTERJEE, S+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 1991::Large wind speeds: Modeling and outlier detection+Dupuis, DJ; Field, CA+JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS+MAR 2004::no title+DUTTA KK+0225 U PENNS WHART S+2003::Extracting probabilistic information from the prices of interest rate options: Tests of distributional assumptions+Dutta, KK; Babbel, DF+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+MAY 2005::Kurtosis modelling by means of the j-transformation+Fischer, M.; Klein, I.+Allgemeines Statistisches Archiv+2004::Tukey-type distributions in the context of financial data+Fischer, Matthias; Horn, Armin; Klein, Ingo+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2007::Summarizing shape numerically: the g and h distributions+Hoaglin, D.C.+Data Analysis for Tables, Trends, and Shapes+1983::Power kurtosis transformations: Definition, properties and ordering+Klein, I.; Fischer, M.+Allgemeines Statistisches Archiv+2006::no title+MACGILLIVRAY HL+GEN G H DISTRI UNPUB+1997::no title+MILLS TC+STATISTICIAN+1995::Fitting quantiles: Doubling, HR, HQ, and HHH distributions+Morgenthaler, S; Tukey, JW+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 2000::Weighted quantile-based estimation for a class of transformation distributions+Rayner, GD; MacGillivray, HL+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 28 2002::Numerical maximum likelihood estimation for the g-and-k and generalized g-and-h distributions+Rayner, GD; MacGillivray, HL+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+JAN 2002::no title+Tukey, JW.+Exploratory data analysis+1977::no title+van Zwet, W.+Convex Transformations of Random Variables+1964"

Finding local departures from a parametric model using nonparametric regression,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0116-x,JAN 2010,23,3,"Goodness-of-fit evaluation of a parametric regression model is often done through hypothesis testing, where the fit of the model of interest is compared statistically to that obtained under a broader class of models. Nonparametric regression models are frequently used as the latter type of model, because of their flexibility and wide applicability. To date, this type of tests has generally been performed globally, by comparing the parametric and nonparametric fits over the whole range of the data. However, in some instances it might be of interest to test for deviations from the parametric model that are localized to a subset of the data. In this case, a global test will have low power and hence can miss important local deviations. Alternatively, a naive testing approach that discards all observations outside the local interval will suffer from reduced sample size and potential overfitting. We therefore propose a new local goodness-of-fit test for parametric regression models that can be applied to a subset of the data but relies on global model fits, and propose a bootstrap-based approach for obtaining the distribution of the test statistic. We compare the new approach with the global and the naive tests, both theoretically and through simulations, and illustrate its practical behavior in an application. We find that the local test has a better ability to detect local deviations than the other two tests.","Cramer-von Mises test,Wild bootstrap,Local polynomial regression","OF-FIT,FUNCTIONAL FORM,CONSISTENT TEST,LINEAR-MODELS,GOODNESS,HYPOTHESIS,CHECKING","Opsomer, J.

Bootstrap methods for single structural change tests: power versus corrected size and empirical illustration,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-008-0123-6,JAN 2010,35,4,"This paper assesses the performance of tests for a single structural change at unknown date when regressors are stationary, trending and when they have a break in mean. Size and power of the test procedures are compared in a simulation setup particularly aimed at autoregressive models using their limiting distribution and some bootstrap approximations. The comparisons are performed using graphical methods, namely P value discrepancy plots and size-power curves. The simulation study gives some interesting insights to the test procedures. Indeed, it documents that tests based on the conventional asymptotic distribution are oversized in small samples. The size correction is achieved by some bootstrap methods which appear to possess reasonable size properties. For the power study, the proposed bootstrap method improves on the asymptotic approximations of some tests for heteroskedastic regression errors especially when there is a mean-shift in the regressors. This result has not been found for the case of i.i.d. errors where the bootstrap tests have the same power properties as the tests based on the asymptotic approximations. We finally study the relationship between two monthly US interest rates. The results show that such relationship has been altered by a regime-shift located in May 1981.","Break date,Bootstrap techniques,Graphical methods","PARAMETER INSTABILITY,LINEAR-REGRESSION,CHANGE-POINT,MODELS,CONSTANCY,TIME,HYPOTHESIS,MATRIX","Jouini, Jamel@Univ 7 Novembre Carthage, FSEGN & LEGI EPT, Tunis, Tunisia@Univ Aix Marseille 2, GREQAM, Marseille, France","Jouini, Jamel@Universite de Carthage@Aix-Marseille Universite",not exist,"no title+Amemiya,, T.+Advanced Econometrics+1985::Tests for parameter instability and structural change with unknown change point (vol 71, pg 395, 2003)+Andrews, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2003::OPTIMAL TESTS WHEN A NUISANCE PARAMETER IS PRESENT ONLY UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE+ANDREWS, DWK; PLOBERGER, W+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1994::TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::Optimal changepoint tests for normal linear regression+Andrews, DWK; Lee, I; Ploberger, W+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 1996::Estimation of a change point in multiple regression models+Bai, J+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 1997::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::SIMULATED POWER FUNCTIONS+BERAN, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1986::BOOTSTRAP TESTS AND CONFIDENCE-REGIONS FOR FUNCTIONS OF A COVARIANCE-MATRIX+BERAN, R; SRIVASTAVA, MS+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1985::TESTS OF EQUALITY BETWEEN SETS OF COEFFICIENTS IN 2 LINEAR REGRESSIONS+CHOW, GC+ECONOMETRICA+1960::MOSUM TESTS FOR PARAMETER CONSTANCY+CHU, CSJ; HORNIK, K; KUAN, CM+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1995::no title+DAVIDSON R+99A32 GREQAM U AIX M+1999::Bootstrap tests: how many bootstraps?+Davidson, R; MacKinnon, JG.+Econom Rev+2000::The size distortion of bootstrap tests+Davidson, R; MacKinnon, JG+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 1999::Graphical methods for investigating the size and power of hypothesis tests+Davidson, R; MacKinnon, JG+MANCHESTER SCHOOL+JAN 1998::The power of bootstrap and asymptotic tests+Davidson, Russell; MacKinnon, James G.+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+AUG 2006::Testing structural stability with endogenous breakpoint - A size comparison of analytic and bootstrap procedures+Diebold, FX; Chen, C+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN 1996::MODIFIED RANDOMIZATION TESTS FOR NONPARAMETRIC HYPOTHESES+DWASS, M+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1957::1977 RIETZ LECTURE - BOOTSTRAP METHODS - ANOTHER LOOK AT THE JACKKNIFE+EFRON, B+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::no title+Efron, B.+The jackknife, the bootstrap, and other resampling plans.+1982::ON THE NUMBER OF BOOTSTRAP SIMULATIONS REQUIRED TO CONSTRUCT A CONFIDENCE-INTERVAL+HALL, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1986::The bootstrap and Edgeworth expansion+Hall, P.+SPRINGER SERIES STAT+1992::TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY IN REGRESSIONS WITH I(1) PROCESSES+HANSEN, BE+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1992::Testing for structural change in conditional models+Hansen, BE+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 2000::Tests for constancy of model parameters over time+Hjort, NL; Koning, A+JOURNAL OF NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS+APR 2002::no title+HOROWITZ JL+ADV EC ECONOMETRICS+1997::BOOTSTRAP-BASED CRITICAL-VALUES FOR THE INFORMATION MATRIX TEST+HOROWITZ, JL+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+APR 1994::A perspective on application of bootstrap methods in econometrics+Jeong, J.; Maddala, G.

Usually the control (standard) treatment has been treated as one specific factor level. In this paper, in contrast to others in this area, the control (standard) may not be strictly connected with treatment combinations. The new incomplete split-plot designs with control satisfy all generally accepted methodological requirements, with special reference to the problems of randomisation. Moreover, tools are described which allow checking of the general balance or efficiency of the design, as well as performance of experiments with inference.","Incomplete block design,Split-plot design,Control-treatment,General balance,Efficiency factors","ORTHOGONAL BLOCK STRUCTURE,BALANCED DESIGNS","Aastveit, Are Halvor@Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Chem Biotechnol & Food Sci, As, Norway::Almoy, Trygve@Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Chem Biotechnol & Food Sci, As, Norway::Mejza, Iwona@Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Math & Stat Methods, Poznan, Poland::Mejza, Stanislaw@Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Math & Stat Methods, Poznan, Poland","Aastveit, Are Halvor@Norwegian University of Life Sciences::Almoy, Trygve@Norwegian University of Life Sciences::Mejza, Iwona@Poznan University of Life Sciences::Mejza, Stanislaw@Poznan University of Life Sciences",not exist,"no title+BAILEY R+MATH APPL+1995::Some theoretical results for fractional factorial split-plot designs+Bingham, DR; Sitter, RR+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 1999::Block designs: a randomization approach.

Comparison of PLS algorithms when number of objects is much larger than number of variables,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0251-7,AUG 2009,11,7,"NIPALS and SIMPLS algorithms are the most commonly used algorithms for partial least squares analysis. When the number of objects, N, is much larger than the number of explanatory, K, and/or response variables, M, the NIPALS algorithm can be time consuming. Even though the SIMPLS is not as time consuming as the NIPALS and can be preferred over the NIPALS, there are kernel algorithms developed especially for the cases where N is much larger than number of variables. In this study, the NIPALS, SIMPLS and some kernel algorithms have been used to built partial least squares regression model. Their performances have been compared in terms of the total CPU time spent for the calculations of latent variables, leave-one-out cross validation and bootstrap methods. According to the numerical results, one of the kernel algorithms suggested by Dayal and MacGregor (J Chemom 11: 73-85, 1997) is the fastest algorithm.","High-dimensional data,Kernel matrix,Multicollinearity,Multiple linear regression,NIPALS,Partial least squares,SIMPLS","KERNEL ALGORITHM,CROSS-VALIDATION,REGRESSION","Alin, Aylin@Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fen Edebiyat Fak, Istat Bolumu, Izmir, Turkey","Alin, Aylin@Dokuz Eylul University","Rohlf, F@A-8710-2008::ALIN, Aylin@E-8799-2010","Introduction to the bootstrap world+Boos, DD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 2003::Improved PLS algorithms+Dayal, BS; MacGregor, JF+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1997::SIMPLS - AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION+DEJONG, S+CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS+MAR 1993::COMMENTS ON THE PLS KERNEL ALGORITHM+DEJONG, S; TERBRAAK, CJF+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+MAR-APR 1994::Bootstrap methods for standard errors, confidence intervals, and other measures of statistical accuracy+Efron, B; Tibshirani, R.+Stat Sci+1986::THE KERNEL ALGORITHM FOR PLS+LINDGREN, F; GELADI, P; WOLD, S+JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1993::Alternative partial least-squares (PLS) algorithms+Lindgren, F; Rannar, S+PERSPECTIVES IN DRUG DISCOVERY AND DESIGN+JAN 1998::CROSS-VALIDATION OF REGRESSION-MODELS+PICARD, RR; COOK, RD+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1984::A PLS KERNEL ALGORITHM FOR DATA SETS WITH MANY VARIABLES AND FEWER OBJECTS .1.

On locally optimal invariant unbiased tests for the variance components ratio in mixed linear models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0257-1,AUG 2009,28,0,"In the paper the problem of testing of two-sided hypotheses for variance components in mixed linear models is considered. When the uniformly most powerful invariant test does not exist (see e. g. Das and Sinha, in Proceedings of the second international Tampere conference in statistics, 1987; Gnot and Michalski, in Statistics 25: 213-223, 1994; Michalski and Zmyslony, in Statistics 27: 297-310, 1996) then to conduct the optimal statistical inference on model parameters a construction of a test with locally best properties is desirable, cf. Michalski (in Tatra Mountains Mathematical Publications 26: 1-21, 2003). The main goal of this article is the construction of the locally best invariant unbiased test for a single variance component (or for a ratio of variance components). The result has been obtained utilizing Andersson's and Wijsman's approach connected with a representation of density function of maximal invariant (Andersson, in Ann Stat 10: 955-961, 1982; Wijsman, in Proceedings of fifth Berk Symp Math Statist Prob 1: 389-400, 1967; Wijsman, in Sankhya a A 48: 142, 1986; Khuri et al., in Statistical tests for mixed linear models, 1998) and from generalized Neyman-Pearson Lemma (Dantzig and Wald, in Ann Math Stat 22: 8793, 1951; Rao, in Linear statistical inference and its applications, 1973). One selected real example of an unbalanced mixed linear model is given, for which the power functions of the LBIU test and Wald's test (the F-test in ANOVA model) are computed, and compared with the attainable upper bound of power obtained by using Neyman-Pearson Lemma.","Variance components,Invariant unbiased test,Mixed linear model,Distribution of quadratic forms","CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,MAXIMAL INVARIANTS","Michalski, Andrzej@Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Math, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland","Michalski, Andrzej@Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences",not exist,"DISTRIBUTIONS OF MAXIMAL INVARIANTS USING QUOTIENT MEASURES+ANDERSSON, S+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::ON THE FUNDAMENTAL LEMMA OF NEYMAN AND PEARSON+DANTZIG, GB; WALD, A+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1951::Robust optimum invariant unbiased tests for variance components+Das, R; Sinha B, K.+P 2 INT TAMP C STAT+1987::The distribution of a linear combination of x2 random variables+Davies, R.

Analysis of an European union election using principal component analysis,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0264-2,AUG 2009,13,4,"While studying the results from one European Parliament election, the question of principal component analysis (PCA) suitability for this kind of data was raised. Since multiparty data should be seen as compositional data (CD), the application of PCA is inadvisable and may conduct to ineligible results. This work points out the limitations of PCA to CD and presents a practical application to the results from the European Parliament election in 2004. We present a comparative study between the results of PCA, Crude PCA and Logcontrast PCA (Aitchison in: Biometrika 70: 57-61, 1983; Kucera, Malmgren in: Marine Micropaleontology 34: 117-120, 1998). As a conclusion of this study, and concerning the mentioned data set, the approach which produced clearer results was the Logcontrast PCA. Moreover, Crude PCA conducted to misleading results since nonlinear relations were presented between variables and the linear PCA proved, once again, to be inappropriate to analyse data which can be seen as CD.","Compositional data,Principal component analysis,Crude PCA,Logcontrast PCA,Electoral data","COMPOSITIONAL DATA,BIPLOT,MODEL,ZEROS","Rodrigues, Paulo C.@Nova Univ Lisbon, Caparica, Portugal@Poznan Univ Life Sci, Poznan, Poland::Lima, Ana T.@Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands","Rodrigues, Paulo C.@Poznan University of Life Sciences@Universidade Nova de Lisboa::Lima, Ana T.@Utrecht University","Lima, Ana@A-8719-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6980-6553::nipe, cef@A-4218-2010::Rodrigues, Paulo@D-5067-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1248-9910","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITIONAL DATA+AITCHISON, J+BIOMETRIKA+1983::no title+Aitchison, J.+The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data+1986::no title+BARCELOVIDAL+CODAWORK03+2003::BIPLOT AS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR MODELS OF 2-WAY TABLES+BRADU, D; GABRIEL, KR+TECHNOMETRICS+1978::A latent Gaussian model for compositional data with zeros+Butler, Adam; Glasbey, Chris+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2008::no title+CHAYES F+MATH GEOL+1978::BIPLOT GRAPHIC DISPLAY OF MATRICES WITH APPLICATION TO PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS+GABRIEL, KR+BIOMETRIKA+1971::no title+Jolliffe, IT.+Principal Component Analysis+2002::A statistical model for multiparty electoral data+Katz, JN; King, G+AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW+MAR 1999::Logratio transformation of compositional data - a resolution of the constant sum constraint+Kucera, M; Malmgren, BA+MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY+JUN 1998::A modified EM alr-algorithm for replacing rounded zeros in compositional data sets+Palarea-Albaladejo, J.; Martin-Fernandez, J.

Tests of additivity in mixed and fixed effect two-way ANOVA models with single sub-class numbers,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-009-0254-4,AUG 2009,14,5,"In variety testing as well as in psychological assessment, the situation occurs that in a two-way ANOVA-type model with only one replication per cell, analysis is done under the assumption of no interaction between the two factors. Tests for this situation are known only for fixed factors and normally distributed outcomes. In the following we will present five additivity tests and apply them to fixed and mixed models and to quantitative as well as to Bernoulli distributed data. We consider their performance via simulation studies with respect to the type-I-risk and power. Furthermore, two new approaches will be presented, one being a modification of Tukey's test and the other being a new experimental design to test for interactions.","Additivity tests,Two-way ANOVA without replication,Mixed model,Block design,Rasch model","NO REPLICATION,TABLES","Rasch, Dieter@Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Appl Stat, Vienna, Austria::Rusch, Thomas@WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Math & Stat, Vienna, Austria::Simeckova, Marie@Inst Anim Sci, Biometr Unit, Prague, Czech Republic::Kubinger, Klaus D.@Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Div Psychol Assessment & Appl Psychometr, Vienna, Austria::Moder, Karl@Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Appl Stat, Vienna, Austria::Simecek, Petr@Inst Anim Sci, Biometr Unit, Prague, Czech Republic","Rasch, Dieter@University of Bodenkultur Wien::Rusch, Thomas@Vienna University of Economics & Business::Simeckova, Marie@Czech Research Institute of Animal Science::Kubinger, Klaus D.@University of Vienna::Moder, Karl@University of Bodenkultur Wien::Simecek, Petr@Czech Research Institute of Animal Science","Simecek, Petr@G-6366-2014@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2922-7183::Simecek, Petr@G-2585-2013","Testing non-additivity (interaction) in two-way ANOVA tables with no replication+Alin, A; Kurt, S+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+FEB 2006::no title+BARTLETT MS+ROY SOC LONDON P   A+1937::no title+Bates, D.M.; Watts, D.B.+Nonlinear Regression Analysis and Its Applications+1988::Testing additivity in two-way classifications with no replications: the locally best invariant test+Boik, Robert J.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+1993::no title+Cox, D.

Several approaches offer different approximations to the distribution of the test statistic. The question of statistical properties of these approximations is still alive. Here, we present a brief overview of several approaches suggested in the literature and implemented in software with a focus on investigating the accuracy of p values as well as their dependence on nuisance parameters and on the underlying assumption of normality. We illustrate by simulation the behavior of p values. In addition to the Satterthwaite-Fai-Cornelius test, the Kenward-Roger test, the simple ANOVA F test, the parametric bootstrap test, and the generalized F test will be briefly discussed.","Accuracy of p value,Approximate F test,Nonhomogeneous one-way fixed model","UNEQUAL ERROR VARIANCES,MODELS,TESTS,HYPOTHESES,LIKELIHOOD","Volaufova, Julia@LSUHSC Sch Publ Hlth, Biostat Program, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA","Volaufova, Julia@Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans@Louisiana State University System",not exist,"SMALL SAMPLE BEHAVIOR OF SOME STATISTICS WHICH TEST EQUALITY OF SEVERAL MEANS+BROWN, MB; FORSYTHE, AB+TECHNOMETRICS+1974::no title+Casella, G.; Berger, R.

Estimation of the variance when kurtosis is known,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0084-1,JUN 2009,3,3,"The unbiased estimator of a population variance sigma(2), S (2) has traditionally been overemphasized, regardless of sample size. In this paper, alternative estimators of population variance are developed. These estimators are biased and have the minimum possible mean-squared error [and we define them as the ""minimum mean-squared error biased estimators"" (MBBE)]. The comparative merit of these estimators over the unbiased estimator is explored using relative efficiency (RE) (a ratio of mean-squared error values). It is found that, across all population distributions investigated, the RE of the MBBE is much higher for small samples and progressively diminishes to 1 with increasing sample size. The paper gives two applications involving the normal and exponential distributions.","Kurtosis,Minimum mean-squared error,Biased estimator,Relative efficiency,Unbiased sample variance",,"Wencheko, Eshetu@Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Stat, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia::Chipoyera, Honest W.@Univ Limpopo, Dept Stat & Operat Res, ZA-0727 Sovenga, South Africa","Wencheko, Eshetu@Addis Ababa University::Chipoyera, Honest W.@University of Limpopo",not exist,"no title+KLEFFE J+LINEAR STAT INFERENC+1985::A NOTE ON AN ESTIMATOR FOR THE VARIANCE THAT UTILIZES THE KURTOSIS+SEARLS, DT; INTARAPANICH, P+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1990::Improved estimation of the mean in one-parameter exponential families with known coefficient of variation+Wencheko, E; Wijekoon, P+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JAN 2005"
Robust Bayesian bonus-malus premiums under the conditional specification model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0085-0,JUN 2009,16,0,"The conditional specification technique introduced by Arnold et al. (Conditional specification of statistical models. Springer series in statistics. Springer, New York, 1999) was used in Sarabia et al. (Astin Bull 34(1):85-98, 2004) to obtain bonus-malus premiums. The Poisson distribution for which the parameter is a function of the classical structure parameter was used and a new class of prior distributions appeared in a natural way. This model contains, as a particular case, the classical compound Poisson model. In the present paper, the Bayesian robustness of this new model is examined and found to be much more robust than in the classical model in GA(3)mez et al. (Insur Math Econ 31:105-113, 2002). For the present study, the moment conditions on the prior distribution are required.

L-p loss functions: a robust bayesian approach,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-007-0093-0,JUN 2009,11,1,"In bayesian inference, the Bayes estimator is the alternative with the minimum expected loss. In most cases, the loss function shows the distance between the alternative and the parameter. Therefore, any distance can lead to a loss function. Among the best known distance functions is L-p one, where the choice of value p may be difficult and arbitrary. This paper examines robust models where the loss function is modelled by family L-p. Our solution concept is the non-dominated alternative. We characterize the non-dominated set by having the posterior distribution function satisfy a particular asymmetry property.

In short, when the rates of birth and death are fixed, we would like to test if each interaction parameter is higher or lower than a fixed reference rate. We choose a statistical model where the actual population sizes are modelled as random perturbations of the solutions to this ODE. By assuming that the random perturbations follow correlated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, we propose the uniformly most powerful test concerning each interaction parameter of the ODE and, we establish the asymptotic properties of the test.

Robust estimation of dynamic fixed-effects panel data models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0545-7,FEB 2014,13,3,"This paper extends an existing outlier-robust estimator of linear dynamic panel data models with fixed effects, which is based on the median ratio of two consecutive pairs of first-order differenced data. To improve its precision and robustness properties, a general procedure based on higher-order pairwise differences and their ratios is designed. The asymptotic distribution of this class of estimators is derived. Further, the breakdown point properties are obtained under contamination by independent additive outliers and by the patches of additive outliers, and are used to select the pairwise differences that do not compromise the robustness properties of the procedure. The proposed estimator is additionally compared with existing methods by means of Monte Carlo simulations.","Breakdown point,Dynamic panel data,Fixed effects,Pairwise differences,Robust estimation",,"Aquaro, Michele@Tilburg Univ, CentER, Dept Econometr & OR, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands::Cizek, Pavel@Tilburg Univ, CentER, Dept Econometr & OR, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","Aquaro, Michele@Tilburg University::Cizek, Pavel@Tilburg University",not exist,"Rank estimation of a generalized fixed-effects regression model+Abrevaya, J+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR 2000::One-Step Robust Estimation of Fixed-Effects Panel Data Models+Aquaro, M.; Pavel, C.+Center for Economic Research Discussion Paper, no. 2010-110+2010::no title+Arellano, M.+Panel data econometrics.

Ultrahigh dimensional variable selection through the penalized maximum trimmed likelihood estimator,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0516-z,FEB 2014,44,6,"The penalized maximum likelihood estimator (PMLE) has been widely used for variable selection in high-dimensional data. Various penalty functions have been employed for this purpose, e.g., Lasso, weighted Lasso, or smoothly clipped absolute deviations. However, the PMLE can be very sensitive to outliers in the data, especially to outliers in the covariates (leverage points). In order to overcome this disadvantage, the usage of the penalized maximum trimmed likelihood estimator (PMTLE) is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters in a robust way. The computation of the PMTLE takes advantage of the same technology as used for PMLE but here the estimation is based on subsamples only. The breakdown point properties of the PMTLE are discussed using the notion of -fullness. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated in a simulation study for the classical multiple linear and Poisson linear regression models.","Multiple linear regression,Poisson regression,Robust variable screening,Breakdown point,Outlier detection,Maximum penalized trimmed likelihood estimator","GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,LEAST ANGLE REGRESSION,BREAKDOWN POINTS,COORDINATE DESCENT,ORACLE PROPERTIES,FEATURE SPACE,ROBUST,LASSO,SHRINKAGE,SQUARES","Neykov, N.

Sliced inverse regression for survival data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0552-8,FEB 2014,13,0,"We apply the univariate sliced inverse regression to survival data. Our approach is different from the other papers on this subject. The right-censored observations are taken into account during the slicing of the survival times by assigning each of them with equal weight to all of the slices with longer survival. We test this method with different distributions for the two main survival data models, the accelerated lifetime model and Cox's proportional hazards model. In both cases and under different conditions of sparsity, sample size and dimension of parameters, this non-parametric approach finds the data structure and can be viewed as a variable selector.","Survival data,Sliced inverse regression,Variable selection","SUFFICIENT DIMENSION REDUCTION,CENSORED-DATA","Shevlyakova, Maya@Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland::Morgenthaler, Stephan@Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland","Shevlyakova, Maya@Unknow::Morgenthaler, Stephan@Unknow",not exist,"Comment on Sliced inverse regression for dimension reduction+Cook, D.

A robust method of testing the causal nonresponse is proposed for data sets where survey information can be combined with complete administrative records. It is assumed that population distribution follows approximately the Cox regression model.

Robust confirmatory factor analysis based on the forward search algorithm,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0525-y,FEB 2014,42,0,A key concept of the forward search algorithm in confirmatory factor analysis is ordering of the data on the basis of observational residuals. These residuals are computed under the proposed model and measure the discrepancy between the observed and predicted response for each unit of the sample. Regression-type factor scores are used to estimate model predictions. Informative forward plots are created for indexing influential observations and to show the dynamics of the estimates throughout the search. The detailed influence of each observation on the model parameters and fit indices is analyzed and a robust model inference is achieved. Real and simulated data sets with known contamination schemes are used to demonstrate the performance of the forward search algorithm.,"Confirmatory factor analysis,Robust estimation,Forward search algorithm,Exploratory data analysis,Outlier,Influential observation","COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS,STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,FIT INDEXES,MULTIPLE OUTLIERS,TESTS,SENSITIVITY,REGRESSION,SQUARES","Toman, Ales@Inst Math Phys & Mech, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Toman, Ales@Unknow",not exist,"no title+[Anonymous].+R:A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2011::no title+Atkinson, A.; Riani, M.+Exploring multivariate data with the forward search+2004::no title+Atkinson, A.

When bubbles burst: econometric tests based on structural breaks,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0497-3,NOV 2013,17,9,"Speculative bubbles have played an important role ever since in financial economics. During an ongoing bubble it is relevant for investors and policy-makers to know whether the bubble continues to grow or whether it is already collapsing. Prices are typically well approximated by a random walk in absence of bubbles, while periods of bubbles are characterised by explosive price paths. In this paper we first propose a conventional Chow-type testing procedure for a structural break from an explosive to a random walk regime. It is shown that under the null hypothesis of a mildly explosive process a suitably modified Chow-type statistic possesses a standard normal limiting distribution. Second, a monitoring procedure based on the CUSUM statistic is suggested. It timely indicates such a structural change. Asymptotic results are derived and small-sample properties are studied via Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, two empirical applications illustrate the merits and limitations of our suggested procedures.","Speculative bubbles,Structural breaks,Mildly explosive processes,Monitoring",ROOT,"Breitung, Joerg@Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Inst Econometr, D-53113 Bonn, Germany::Kruse, Robinson@Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Stat, Sch Econ & Management, D-30167 Hannover, Germany@Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Sch Econ & Management, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Breitung, Joerg@University of Bonn::Kruse, Robinson@University of Hannover@Aarhus University",not exist,"no title+BACHELIER L+ANN SCI ECOLE NORM S+1900::Least squares estimation of a shift in linear processes+Bai, Jushan.+Journal of Time Series Analysis+1994::no title+CHOW GC+ECONOMETRICA+1960::Monitoring structural change+Chu, CSJ; Stinchcombe, M; White, H+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 1996::Maximum likelihood estimation for MA(1) processes with a root on or near the unit circle+Davis, RA; Dunsmuir, WTM+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+MAR 1996::Testing for a rational bubble under long memory+Frommel, Michael; Kruse, Robinson+QUANTITATIVE FINANCE+2012::INTRINSIC BUBBLES - THE CASE OF STOCK-PRICES+FROOT, KA; OBSTFELD, M+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+DEC 1991::no title+Homm, U; Breitung, J.+Testing for speculative bubbles in stock markets: a comparison of alternative methods+2010::Testing for Speculative Bubbles in Stock Markets: A Comparison of Alternative Methods+Homm, Ulrich; Breitung, Joerg+JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMETRICS+WIN 2012::no title+Kramer, W.; Sonnberger, H.+The Linear Regression Model under Test+1986::Testing for Multiple Bubbles+Phillips, P.

A toolbox of permutation tests for structural change,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0503-4,NOV 2013,39,3,"The sup test for structural change is embedded into a permutation test framework for a simple location model. The resulting conditional permutation distribution is compared to the usual (unconditional) asymptotic distribution, showing that the power of the test can be clearly improved in small samples. Furthermore, the permutation test is embedded into a general framework that encompasses tools for binary and multivariate dependent variables as well as model-based permutation testing for structural change. It is also demonstrated that the methods can not only be employed for analyzing structural changes in time series data but also for recursive partitioning of cross-section data. The procedures suggested are illustrated using both artificial data and empirical applications (number of youth homicides, employment discrimination data, carbon flux in tropical forests, stock returns, and demand for economics journals).","Conditional inference,Asymptotic distribution,Exact distribution,Maximally-selected statistics","NEOTROPICAL RAIN-FOREST,CONDITIONAL INFERENCE,FRENCH-GUIANA,CHANGE-POINT,STATISTICS,INSTABILITY,PRINCIPLES,PARAMETER,MODELS,SYSTEM","Zeileis, Achim@Univ Innsbruck, Dept Stat, Fac Econ & Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria::Hothorn, Torsten@Univ Zurich, Inst Sozial & Pravent Med, Abt Biostat, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland","Zeileis, Achim@University of Innsbruck::Hothorn, Torsten@University of Zurich","Zeileis, Achim@K-9226-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0918-3766","TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::HETEROSKEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION CONSISTENT COVARIANCE-MATRIX ESTIMATION+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1991::Permutation tests in change point analysis+Antoch, J; Huskova, M+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 15 2001::Free labor for costly journals?+Bergstrom, TC+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+FAL 2001::Impact of severe dry season on net ecosystem exchange in the Neotropical rainforest of French Guiana+Bonal, Damien; Bosc, Alexandre; Ponton, Stephane; et al.+GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY+AUG 2008::Maximally selected Chi-squared statistics and non-monotonic associations: An exact approach based on two cutpoints+Boulesteix, Anne-Laure; Strobl, Carolin+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 15 2007::TECHNIQUES FOR TESTING CONSTANCY OF REGRESSION RELATIONSHIPS OVER TIME+BROWN, RL; DURBIN, J; EVANS, JM+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1975::Respiration from coarse wood litter in central Amazon forests+Chambers, JQ; Schimel, JP; Nobre, AD+BIOGEOCHEMISTRY+JAN 2001::TESTS OF EQUALITY BETWEEN SETS OF COEFFICIENTS IN 2 LINEAR REGRESSIONS+CHOW, GC+ECONOMETRICA+1960::Permutation methods: A basis for exact inference+Ernst, MD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+NOV 2004::no title+Fisher, RA.+The Design of Experiments+1935::Changepoint tests designed for the analysis of hiring data arising in employment discrimination cases+Freidlin, B; Gastwirth, JL+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 2000::Numerical computation of multivariate normal probabilities+Genz, A.+J.

On the application of new tests for structural changes on global minimum-variance portfolios,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0511-4,NOV 2013,24,3,"We investigate if portfolios can be improved if the classical Markowitz mean-variance portfolio theory is combined with recently proposed change point tests for dependence measures. Taking into account that the dependence structure of financial assets typically cannot be assumed to be constant over longer periods of time, we estimate the covariance matrix of the assets, which is used to construct global minimum-variance portfolios, by respecting potential change points. It is seen that a recently proposed test for changes in the whole covariance matrix is indeed partially useful whereas pairwise tests for variances and correlations are not suitable for these applications without further adjustments.","Fluctuation test,Markowitz,Portfolio optimization,Structural break","SELECTION,MARKET,MODEL","Wied, Dominik@TU Dortmund, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Ziggel, Daniel@Quasol GmbH, D-48165 Munster, Germany::Berens, Tobias@TU Dortmund, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","Wied, Dominik@Dortmund University of Technology::Ziggel, Daniel@Unknow::Berens, Tobias@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"BREAK DETECTION IN THE COVARIANCE STRUCTURE OF MULTIVARIATE TIME SERIES MODELS+Aue, Alexander; Hormann, Siegfried; Horvath, Lajos; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2009::ON THE SENSITIVITY OF MEAN-VARIANCE-EFFICIENT PORTFOLIOS TO CHANGES IN ASSET MEANS - SOME ANALYTICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS+BEST, MJ; GRAUER, RR+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+1991::An empirical study of correlation and volatility changes of stock indices and their impact on risk figures+Bissantz, N.; Ziggel, D.; Bissantz, K.+Acta Univ.

Fractional integration versus level shifts: the case of realized asset correlations,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0513-2,NOV 2013,32,5,"Long memory has been widely documented for realized financial market volatility. As a novelty, we consider daily realized asset correlations and we investigate whether the observed persistence is (i) due to true long memory (i.e. fractional integration) or (ii) artificially generated by some structural break processes. These two phenomena are difficult to be distinguished in practice. Our empirical results strongly indicate that the hyperbolic decay of the autocorrelation functions of pair-wise realized correlation series is indeed not driven by a truly fractionally integrated process. This finding is robust against user specific parameter choices in the applied test statistic and holds for all 15 considered time series. As a next step, we apply simple models with deterministic level shifts. When selecting the number of breaks, estimating the breakpoints and the corresponding structural break models we find a substantial degree of co-movement between the realized correlation series hinting at co-breaking. The estimated structural break models are interpreted in the light of the historic economic and financial development.","Long memory,Fractional integration,Structural breaks,Realized correlation","LONG MEMORY PROCESSES,STRUCTURAL-CHANGE,OLS RESIDUALS,MODELS","Bertram, Philip@Leibniz Univ Hannover, Sch Econ & Management, Inst Stat, D-30167 Hannover, Germany::Kruse, Robinson@Leibniz Univ Hannover, Sch Econ & Management, Inst Stat, D-30167 Hannover, Germany@Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Sch Econ & Management, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark::Sibbertsen, Philipp@Leibniz Univ Hannover, Sch Econ & Management, Inst Stat, D-30167 Hannover, Germany","Bertram, Philip@University of Hannover::Kruse, Robinson@University of Hannover@Aarhus University::Sibbertsen, Philipp@University of Hannover",not exist,"Modeling and forecasting realized volatility+Andersen, TG; Bollerslev, T; Diebold, FX; et al.+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2003::Smooth transition patterns in the realized stock-bond correlation+Aslanidis, Nektarios; Christiansen, Charlotte+JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE+SEP 2012::Modeling tick-by-tick realized correlations+Audrino, Francesco; Corsi, Fulvio+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 1 2010::Computation and analysis of multiple structural change models+Bai, J; Perron, P+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 2003::Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes+Bai, JS; Perron, P+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 1998::Long memory processes and fractional integration in econometrics+Baillie, RT+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 1996::Econometric analysis of realized covariation: High frequency based covariance, regression, and correlation in financial economics+Barndorff-Nielsen, OE; Shephard, N+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 2004::no title+Beran, J.+Statistics for Long-Memory Processes+1994::On discriminating between long-range dependence and changes in mean+Berkes, Istvan; Horvath, Lajos; Kokoszka, Piotr; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2006::MODELLING AND FORECASTING MULTIVARIATE REALIZED VOLATILITY+Chiriac, Roxana; Voev, Valeri+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+SEP-OCT 2011::Tests of bias in log-periodogram regression+Davidson, James; Sibbertsen, Philipp+ECONOMICS LETTERS+FEB 2009::Long memory and regime switching+Diebold, FX; Inoue, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 2001::no title+Doukhan, P.; Oppenheim, G.; Taqqu, M.

Consistent estimation for discretely observed Markov jump processes with an absorbing state,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0515-0,NOV 2013,22,4,"For a continuous-time Markov process, commonly, only discrete-time observations are available. We analyze multiple observations of a homogeneous Markov jump process with an absorbing state. We establish consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator, as the number of Markov processes increases. To accomplish uniform convergence in the continuous mapping theorem, we use the continuity of the transition probability in the parameters, the compactness of the parameter space and the boundedness of probabilities. We allow for a stochastic time-grid of observation points with different intensities for each observation process. Furthermore, we account for right censoring. The estimate is obtained via the EM algorithm with an E-step given in closed form. In our empirical application of credit rating histories, we fit the model of Weibach and Mollenhauer (J Korean Stat Soc 40:469-485, 2011) and find marked differences, compared to the continuous-time analysis.","Multiple markov jump process,Credit rating,Discrete observations,EM,Parametric maximum likelihood","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,INCOMPLETE DATA,EM ALGORITHM","Kremer, Alexander@Univ Rostock, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Inst Econ, D-18057 Rostock, Germany::Weissbach, Rafael@Univ Rostock, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Inst Econ, D-18057 Rostock, Germany","Kremer, Alexander@University of Rostock::Weissbach, Rafael@University of Rostock",not exist,"Maximum likelihood estimation of discretely sampled diffusions: A closed-form approximation approach+Ait-Sahalia, Y+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::TESTING FOR JUMPS IN A DISCRETELY OBSERVED PROCESS+Ait-Sahalia, Yacine; Jacod, Jean+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2009::no title+Amann, H.+Gewohnliche Differentialgleichungen+1997::no title+Billingsley, P.+Statistical Inference for Markov Sequences+1961::Statistical inference for discretely observed Markov jump processes+Bladt, M; Sorensen, M+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2005::Efficient estimation of transition rates between credit ratings from observations at discrete time points+Bladty, Mogens; Sorensen, Michael+QUANTITATIVE FINANCE+2009::On likelihood estimation for discretely observed markov jump processes+Dehay, Dominique; Yao, Jian-Feng+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2007::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::no title+Guttorp, P; Minin, VN.+Stochastic modeling of scientific data+1995::Statistical inference in evolutionary models of DNA sequences via the EM algorithm+Hobolth, A; Jensen, JL+STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY+2005::A Markov model for the term structure of credit risk spreads+Jarrow, RA; Lando, D; Turnbull, SM+REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES+SUM 1997::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION IN BIRTH-AND-DEATH PROCESS+KEIDING, N+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1975::ESTIMATION IN BIRTH PROCESS+KEIDING, N+BIOMETRIKA+1974::Bayesian analysis of multistate event history data: beta-Dirichlet process prior+Kim, Yongdai; James, Lancelot; Weissbach, Rafael+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2012::Modeling frailty-correlated defaults using many macroeconomic covariates+Koopman, Siem Jan; Lucas, Andre; Schwaab, Bernd+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUN 2011::no title+Kuchler, U.; Sorensen, M.+Exponential Families of Stochastic Processes+1997::Statistical Models+Liese, Friedrich; Miescke, Klaus-J.+STATISTICAL DECISION THEORY: ESTIMATION, TESTING, AND SELECTION+2008::Estimation of rating class transition probabilities with incomplete data+Maehlmann, Thomas+JOURNAL OF BANKING &amp; FINANCE+NOV 2006::Modelling correlations in credit portfolio risk+Rosenow, B; Weissbach, R.+J Risk Manag Financial Inst+2010::no title+van der Vaart, A.

Nonlinear IV panel unit root testing under structural breaks in the error variance,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0502-5,NOV 2013,35,1,"The paper examines the behavior of a generalized version of the nonlinear IV unit root test proposed by Chang (2002) when the series' errors exhibit nonstationary volatility. The leading case of such nonstationary volatility concerns structural breaks in the error variance. We show that the generalized test is not robust to variance changes in general, and illustrate the extent of the resulting size distortions in finite samples. More importantly, we show that pivotality is recovered when using Eicker-White heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors. This contrasts with the case of Dickey-Fuller unit root tests, for which Eicker-White standard errors do not produce robustness and thus require computationally costly corrections such as the (wild) bootstrap or estimation of the so-called variance profile. The pivotal versions of the generalized IV tests - with or without the correct standard errors - do however have no power in -neighbourhoods of the null. We also study the validity of panel versions of the tests considered here.","Panel unit roots,Nonlinear instrumental variables,Structural breaks,Heteroskedasticity,Eicker-White standard errors","INTEGRATED TIME-SERIES,NONSTATIONARY VOLATILITY,HETEROSKEDASTICITY,AUTOREGRESSION,ASYMPTOTICS,ESTIMATORS,INFERENCE,MODELS","Demetrescu, Matei@Univ Bonn, Hausdorff Ctr Math, D-53113 Bonn, Germany@Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-53113 Bonn, Germany::Hanck, Christoph@Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, D-45117 Essen, Germany","Demetrescu, Matei@University of Bonn::Hanck, Christoph@University of Duisburg Essen","Demetrescu, Matei@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0815-5384","Unit root tests under time-varying variances+Cavaliere, G.+Econometric Rev.+2004::Bootstrap unit root tests for time series with nonstationary volatility+Cavaliere, Giuseppe; Taylor, A.

The limiting distributions of these test statistics are derived when the cross-sectional dimension and the time-series dimension are both large.

EEG in the diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0538-6,NOV 2013,15,7,"Dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is worldwide one of the main medical and social challenges for the next years and decades. An automated analysis of changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of patients with AD may contribute to improving the quality of medical diagnoses. In this paper, measures based on uni- and multi-variate spectral densities are studied in order to measure slowing and, in greater detail, reduced synchrony in the EEG signals. Hereby, an EEG segment is interpreted as sample of a (weakly) stationary stochastic process. The spectral density was computed using an indirect estimator. Slowing was considered by calculating the spectral power in predefined frequency bands. As measures for synchrony between single EEG signals, we analyzed coherences, partial coherences, bivariate and conditional Granger causality; for measuring synchrony between groups of EEG signals, we considered coherences, partial coherences, bivariate and conditional Granger causality between the respective first principal components of each group, and dynamic canonic correlations. As measure for local synchrony within a group, the amount of variance explained by the respective first principal component of static and dynamic principal component analysis was investigated. These measures were exemplarily computed for resting state EEG recordings from 83 subjects diagnosed with probable AD. Here, the severity of AD is quantified by the Mini Mental State Examination score.","Alzheimer's Disease,Electroencephalogram,Spectral density estimation,Coherence,Partial coherence,Granger causality,Canonical correlation","IDENTIFICATION,STATE","Waser, M.@AIT, A-1220 Vienna, Austria::Deistler, M.@Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Math Methods Econ, A-1040 Vienna, Austria::Garn, H.@AIT, A-1220 Vienna, Austria::Benke, T.@Med Univ Innsbruck, Dept Neurol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria::Dal-Bianco, P.@Med Univ Vienna, Dept Neurol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria::Ransmayr, G.@Gen Hosp Linz, Dept Neurol, A-4021 Linz, Austria::Grossegger, D.@Dr Grossegger & Drbal GmbH, BEST Med Syst, A-1190 Vienna, Austria::Schmidt, R.@Med Univ Graz, Dept Neurol, A-8036 Graz, Austria","Waser, M.@Austrian Research Center::Deistler, M.@Vienna University of Technology::Garn, H.@Austrian Research Center::Benke, T.@Medical University of Innsbruck::Dal-Bianco, P.@Medical University of Vienna::Ransmayr, G.@Unknow::Grossegger, D.@Unknow::Schmidt, R.@Medical University of Graz",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::no title+Brillinger, D.

Let us do the twist again,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0512-3,NOV 2013,19,4,"Kramer (Sankhy 42:130-131, 1980) posed the following problem: ""Which are the , given and , such that OLS and Gauss-Markov are equal?"". In other words, the problem aimed at identifying those vectors for which the ordinary least squares (OLS) and Gauss-Markov estimates of the parameter vector coincide under the general Gauss-Markov model . The problem was later called a ""twist"" to Kruskal's Theorem, which provides conditions necessary and sufficient for the OLS and Gauss-Markov estimates of to be equal. The present paper focuses on a similar problem to the one posed by Kramer in the aforementioned paper.

On moment indeterminacy of the Benini income distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0535-9,NOV 2013,22,3,"The Benini distribution is a lognormal-like distribution generalizing the Pareto distribution. Like the Pareto and the lognormal distributions it was originally proposed for modeling economic size distributions, notably the size distribution of personal income. This paper explores a probabilistic property of the Benini distribution, showing that it is not determined by the sequence of its moments although all the moments are finite. It also provides explicit examples of distributions possessing the same set of moments.

Reducing confidence bands for simulated impulse responses,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0510-5,NOV 2013,26,3,"It is emphasized that the shocks in structural vector autoregressions are only identified up to sign and it is pointed out that this feature can result in very misleading confidence intervals for impulse responses if simulation methods such as Bayesian or bootstrap methods are used. The confidence intervals heavily depend on which variable is used for fixing the signs of the responses. In particular, when the shocks are identified via long-run restrictions the problem can be severe. It is pointed out that a suitable choice of variable for fixing the signs of the responses and, hence, of the shocks, can result in substantial reductions in the confidence bands for impulse responses.","Vector autoregressive process,Impulse responses,Bootstrap,Bayesian estimation","VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS,MONETARY-POLICY SHOCKS,IDENTIFICATION,DISTURBANCES,FLUCTUATIONS,INTERVALS,DEMAND,MARKET,OUTPUT","Luetkepohl, Helmut@Free Univ Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany@DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany","Luetkepohl, Helmut@Free University of Berlin@DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung",not exist,"Comparison of bootstrap confidence intervals for impulse responses of German monetary systems+Benkwitz, A; Lutkepohl, H; Wolters, J+MACROECONOMIC DYNAMICS+FEB 2001::THE DYNAMIC EFFECTS OF AGGREGATE DEMAND AND SUPPLY DISTURBANCES+BLANCHARD, OJ; QUAH, D+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1989::Structural vector autoregressive modeling and impulse responses+Breitung, J.; Bruggemann, R.; Liitkepohl, H.+Applied time series econometrics+2004::Monetary disturbances matter for business fluctuations in the G-7+Canova, F; De Nicolo, G+JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS+SEP 2002::The effects of monetary policy shocks: Evidence from the flow of funds+Christiano, LJ; Eichenbaum, M; Evans, C+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1996::The robustness of identified VAR conclusions about money+Faust, J+CARNEGIE - ROCHESTER CONFERENCE SERIES ON PUBLIC POLICY, VOL 49 - DECEMBER 1998+1998::Small-sample confidence intervals for impulse response functions+Kilian, L+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+MAY 1998::Not All Oil Price Shocks Are Alike: Disentangling Demand and Supply Shocks in the Crude Oil Market+Kilian, Lutz+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JUN 2009::STOCHASTIC TRENDS AND ECONOMIC-FLUCTUATIONS+KING, RG; PLOSSER, CI; STOCK, JH; et al.+AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+SEP 1991::TESTING FOR STRUCTURAL-CHANGE IN DYNAMIC-MODELS+KRAMER, W; PLOBERGER, W; ALT, R+ECONOMETRICA+NOV 1988::no title+Kramer, W.; Sonnberger, H.+The Linear Regression Model under Test+1986::Structural vector autoregressions with Markov switching+Lanne, Markku; Lutkepohl, Helmut; Maciejowska, Katarzyna+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS &amp; CONTROL+FEB 2010::Identifying monetary policy shocks via changes in volatility+Lanne, Markku; Luetkepohl, Helmut+JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING+SEP 2008::no title+no author+Applied Time Series Econometrics+2004::no title+Lutkepohl,, H.+New introduction to multiple time series analysis+2005::ASYMPTOTIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF IMPULSE-RESPONSE FUNCTIONS AND FORECAST ERROR VARIANCE DECOMPOSITIONS OF VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS+LUTKEPOHL, H+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1990::no title+Lutkepohl, H.; Herwartz, H.+Structural vector autoregressions with Markov switching: Combining conventional with statistical identification of shocks+2011::THE CUSUM TEST WITH OLS RESIDUALS+PLOBERGER, W; KRAMER, W+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 1992::A NEW TEST FOR STRUCTURAL STABILITY IN THE LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL+PLOBERGER, W; KRAMER, W; KONTRUS, K+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+FEB 1989::Measuring the reaction of monetary policy to the stock market+Rigobon, R; Sack, B+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 2003::Identification through heteroskedasticity+Rigobon, R+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 2003::MACROECONOMICS AND REALITY+SIMS, CA+ECONOMETRICA+1980::Methods for inference in large multiple-equation Markov-switching models+Sims, Christopher A.; Waggoner, Daniel F.; Zha, Tao+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 2008::Estimating structural macroeconomic shocks through long-run recursive restrictions on vector autoregressive models: The problem of identification+Taylor, MP+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE &amp; ECONOMICS+JUL 2004::What are the effects of monetary policy on output?

On the other hand, group sequential methods provide substantial savings in sample and enable us to make decisions as early as possible. In this manuscript, we intend to combine the benefits of the two methodologies. We propose group sequential tests for one and two population means under RSS. We compare the power, average sample sizes and type I errors of the proposed tests to those of group sequential tests based on simple random sampling schemes. We illustrate the utility of the method by using data from HIV trial.","Auxiliary information,Group sequential methods,Ranked set sampling,Two-sample hypotheses",CLINICAL-TRIALS,"Hussein, A.@Univ Windsor, Dept Math & Stat, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada::Muttlak, H.

Parameter estimation for binomial AR(1) models with applications in finance and industry,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0449-y,AUG 2013,31,8,"Methods for analyzing and modeling count data time series are used in various fields of practice, and they are particularly relevant for applications in finance and economy. We consider the binomial autoregressive (AR(1)) model for count data processes with a first-order AR dependence structure and a binomial marginal distribution. We present four approaches for estimating its model parameters based on given time series data, and we derive expressions for the asymptotic distribution of these estimators. Then we investigate the finite-sample performance of the estimators and of the respective asymptotic approximations in a simulation study, including a discussion of the 2-block jackknife. We illustrate our methods and findings with a real-data example about transactions at the Korea stock market. We conclude with an application of our results for obtaining reliable estimates for process capability indices.","Binomial AR(1) model,Parameter estimation,Process capability indices,Stock data,Thinning operations,2-Block jackknife","TIME-SERIES,CAPABILITY INDEX,COUNTS,AUTOREGRESSION","Weiss, Christian H.@Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Math, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany::Kim, Hee-Young@Korea Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 136701, South Korea","Weiss, Christian H.@Darmstadt University of Technology::Kim, Hee-Young@Korea University",not exist,"Qualitatsmanagementsysteme - Grundlagen und Begriffe+[Anonymous].+DIN EN ISO 9000+2005::Additive outliers in INAR(1) models+Barczy, M; Ispany, M; Pap, G<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Scotto, M; Silva, ME</span>.+Stat Pap+2011::no title+Billingsley, P.+Statistical Inference for Markov Sequences+1961::A fraction defective based capability index+Borges, WD; Ho, LL+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+NOV-DEC 2001::Limit theorems for discrete-time metapopulation models+Buckley, F.

This paper studies the problem of testing the intercept parameter of a simple regression model when NSPI is available on the value of the slope. The information on the slope may have the three different scenarios: (i) unknown (unspecified), (ii) known (certain or specified), and (iii) uncertain if the suspected value is unsure, for which we define the unrestricted test (UT), restricted test (RT) and pre-test test (PTT) for the intercept parameter. The test statistics, their sampling distributions, and power functions are derived. Comparison of the power functions and size of the tests are used to search and recommend a best test. The study reveals that the PTT has a reasonable dominance over the UT and RT both in terms of achieving highest power and lowest size.","Linear regression,Test of intercept,Power function,Normal and bivariate Student-t distributions","UNCERTAIN PRIOR INFORMATION,SHRINKAGE ESTIMATORS,REGRESSION-MODEL,PARAMETERS,PRETEST","Khan, Shahjahan@Univ So Queensland, Dept Math & Comp, Australian Ctr Sustainable Catchments, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia::Pratikno, Budi@Univ So Queensland, Dept Math & Comp, Australian Ctr Sustainable Catchments, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia","Khan, Shahjahan@University of Southern Queensland::Pratikno, Budi@University of Southern Queensland",not exist,"On biases in estimation due to the use of preliminary tests of significance+Bancroft, TA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1944::ANALYSIS + INFERENCE FOR INCOMPLETELY SPECIFIED MODELS INVOLVING USE OF PRELIMINARY TEST(S) OF SIGNIFICANCE+BANCROFT, TA+BIOMETRICS+1964::ON POOLING MEANS WHEN VARIANCE IS UNKNOWN+HAN, CP; BANCROFT, TA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1968::Energy miser-know your plants energy+Kent, R.+Fingerprint+2009::Shrinkage pre-test estimator of the intercept parameter for a regression model with multivariate Student-t errors+Khan, S.; Saleh, A.

Inference on unknown parameters of a Burr distribution under hybrid censoring,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0452-3,AUG 2013,26,8,"Based on hybrid censored data, the problem of making statistical inference on parameters of a two parameter Burr Type XII distribution is taken up. The maximum likelihood estimates are developed for the unknown parameters using the EM algorithm. Fisher information matrix is obtained by applying missing value principle and is further utilized for constructing the approximate confidence intervals. Some Bayes estimates and the corresponding highest posterior density intervals of the unknown parameters are also obtained. Lindley's approximation method and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique have been applied to evaluate these Bayes estimates.

Random rounded integer-valued autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic process,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0453-2,AUG 2013,33,1,"The statistical literature on the analysis of discrete variate time series has concentrated mainly on parametric models, that is the conditional probability mass function is assumed to belong to a parametric family. Generally, these parametric models impose strong assumptions on the relationship between the conditional mean and variance. To generalize these implausible assumptions, this paper instead considers a more realistic semiparametric model, called random rounded integer-valued autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (RRINARCH) model, where there are essentially no assumptions on the relationship between the conditional mean and variance. The new model has several advantages: (a) it provides a coherent semiparametric framework for discrete variate time series, in which the conditional mean and variance can be modeled separately; (b) it allows negative values both for the series and its autocorrelation function; (c) its autocorrelation structure is the same as that of a standard autoregressive (AR) process; (d) standard software for its estimation is directly applicable. For the new model, conditions for stationarity, ergodicity and the existence of moments are established and the consistency and asymptotic normality of the conditional least squares estimator are proved. Simulation experiments are carried out to assess the performance of the model. The analyses of real data sets illustrate the flexibility and usefulness of the RRINARCH model for obtaining more realistic forecast means and variances.","Count data,Conditional mean,Conditional variance,Integer-valued time series,Random rounding operator","TIME-SERIES,REGRESSION-MODEL,COUNTS","Liu, Tianqing@Jilin Univ, Sch Math, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China::Yuan, Xiaohui@Changchun Univ Technol, Sch Basic Sci, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China@NE Normal Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China","Liu, Tianqing@Jilin University::Yuan, Xiaohui@Northeast Normal University - China@Changchun University of Technology",not exist,"Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::First- order integer- valued autoregressive (INAR(1)) process+Alzaid, A.

A three-parameter generalized von Mises distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0454-1,AUG 2013,8,7,"In this paper, we propose a three-parameter generalized von Mises distribution, called the asymmetric generalized von Mises (AGvM) distribution, which is an extension of the von Mises (vM) distribution, and a subclass of the generalized von Mises (GvM) distribution introduced by Gatto and Jammalamadaka (Stat Methodol 4:341-353, 2007). The three parameter model belongs to an exponential family of distributions and can be used to model both asymmetric and bimodal data. Some properties are studied and interpretation of the parameters is discussed in detail. It is shown that the parameters of the AGvM distribution are particularly easy to interpret and contain a skewness measure as one of its three parameters. A real environmental data set example is provided to illustrate the goodness of fit for AGvM distribution.","Asymmetric distribution,Circular distribution,Generalized von Mises distribution,Skewness,Trigonometric moments,von Mises distribution",,"Kim, Sungsu@Keimyung Univ, Dept English Educ, Taegu, South Korea::SenGupta, Ashis@Indian Stat Inst, Appl Stat Unit, Kolkata, India","Kim, Sungsu@Keimyung University::SenGupta, Ashis@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute",not exist,"Sine-skewed circular distributions+Abe, Toshihiro; Pewsey, Arthur+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2011::The generalized von Mises distribution+Gatto, R.; Jammalamadaka, S.+Stat.

Linear models that allow perfect estimation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0455-0,AUG 2013,13,0,"The general Gauss-Markov model, Y = X beta + e, E(e) = 0, Cov(e) = sigma (2) V, has been intensively studied and widely used. Most studies consider covariance matrices V that are nonsingular but we focus on the most difficult case wherein C(X), the column space of X, is not contained in C(V). This forces V to be singular. Under this condition there exist nontrivial linear functions of Q'X beta that are known with probability 1 (perfectly) where . To treat , much of the existing literature obtains estimates and tests by replacing V with a pseudo-covariance matrix T = V + XUX' for some nonnegative definite U such that , see Christensen (Plane answers to complex questions: the theory of linear models, 2002, Chap. 10). We find it more intuitive to first eliminate what is known about X beta and then to adjust X while keeping V unchanged. We show that we can decompose beta into the sum of two orthogonal parts, beta = beta (0) + beta (1), where beta (0) is known. We also show that the unknown component of X beta is , where . We replace the original model with , E(e) = 0, and perform estimation and tests under this new model for which the simplifying assumption holds. This allows us to focus on the part of that parameters that are not known perfectly. We show that this method provides the usual estimates and tests.","General Gauss-Markov model,Singular covariance matrix,Best linear unbiased estimate,Linear hypothesis","COVARIANCE STRUCTURE,MATRIX","Christensen, Ronald@Univ New Mexico, Dept Math & Stat, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA::Lin, Yong@Univ New Mexico, Dept Math & Stat, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Christensen, Ronald@University of New Mexico::Lin, Yong@University of New Mexico",not exist,"WEIGHTED LEAST-SQUARES AND THE GAUSS-MARKOV THEOREM - COMMENT+CHRISTENSEN, R+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1990::The general Gauss-Markov model with possibly singular dispersion matrix+Gross, J+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUL 2004::WEIGHTED LEAST-SQUARES AND THE GAUSS-MARKOV THEOREM - COMMENT+HARVILLE, DA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1990::UNBIASED AND MINIMUM-VARIANCE UNBIASED ESTIMATION OF ESTIMABLE FUNCTIONS FOR FIXED LINEAR-MODELS WITH ARBITRARY COVARIANCE STRUCTURE+HARVILLE, DA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::THE EQUALITY OF THE ORDINARY LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATOR AND THE BEST LINEAR UNBIASED ESTIMATOR - COMMENT+KEMPTHORNE, O+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1989::no title+KREIJGER RG+J AM STAT ASSOC+1977::THE EQUALITY OF THE ORDINARY LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATOR AND THE BEST LINEAR UNBIASED ESTIMATOR+PUNTANEN, S; STYAN, GPH+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+AUG 1989::Some further remarks on the singular linear model+Puntanen, S; Scott, AJ+LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS+APR 1996::A note on a previous lemma in the theory of least squares and some further results+Rao, C.R.+Sankhya Ser.

A copula-based approach to account for dependence in stress-strength models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0463-0,AUG 2013,46,13,"The focus of stress-strength models is on the evaluation of the probability R = P(Y < X) that stress Y experienced by a component does not exceed strength X required to overcome it. In reliability studies, X and Y are typically modeled as independent. Nevertheless, in many applications such an assumption may be unrealistic. This is an interesting methodological issue, especially as the estimation of R for dependent stress and strength has received only limited attention to date. This paper aims to fill this gap by evaluating R taking into account the association between X and Y via a copula-based approach. We calculate a closed-form expression for R by modeling the dependence through a Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula and one of its extensions, numerical solutions for R are, instead, provided when members of Frank's copula family are employed. The marginal distributions are assumed to belong to the Burr system (i.e. Burr III, Dagum or Singh-Maddala type). In all the cases, we prove that neglect of the existing dependence leads to higher or lower values of R than is the case.","Reliability,Burr distributions,Kendall's tau,Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula,Frank copula","GENERALIZED EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION,GUMBEL-MORGENSTERN DISTRIBUTIONS,INTERVAL ESTIMATION,ORDER-STATISTICS,RECORD VALUES,RELIABILITY,INFERENCE,PARAMETER","Domma, Filippo@Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy::Giordano, Sabrina@Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Econ & Stat, Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy","Domma, Filippo@University of Calabria::Giordano, Sabrina@University of Calabria","Domma, Filippo@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1489-1065::giordano, sabrina@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3635-9440","no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.

We propose a very general new approach to construct unbiased estimators of a population variance by U statistics with symmetric kernels of degree higher than two. Surprisingly, all such estimators ultimately reduce to S (2) (Theorem 3.1). While Theorem 3.1 is interesting and novel in its own right, it leads to a newer interpretation of S (2) that is much broader than what is known in the statistical literature including economics, actuarial mathematics, and mathematical finance.","Actuarial mathematics,Economic theory,Gini's mean difference,Mathematical finance,Sample variance,U statistics",,"Mukhopadhyay, Nitis@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA::Chattopadhyay, Bhargab@Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Mukhopadhyay, Nitis@University of Connecticut::Chattopadhyay, Bhargab@University of Connecticut","Chattopadhyay, Bhargab@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7713-3125","no title+[Anonymous].+Sequential estimation.+no time::Measurement of inequality of incomes.+Gini, C.+Econ J+1921::no title+Gini, C(.+L'Ammontare la Composizione della Ricchezza delle Nazioni.+1914::A CLASS OF STATISTICS WITH ASYMPTOTICALLY NORMAL DISTRIBUTION+HOEFFDING, W+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1948::no title+Hoeffding, W.+The strong law of large numbers for U-statistics+1961::no title+Hollander, M.; Wolfe, D.

On multivariate truncated generalized Cauchy distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0467-9,AUG 2013,11,1,"In this paper, a multivariate form of truncated generalized Cauchy distribution (TGCD), which is denoted by (MVTGCD), is introduced. The joint density function, conditional density function, moment generating function and mixed moments of order are obtained. Making use of the mixed moments formula, skewness and kurtosis in case of the bivariate case are obtained. Also, all parameters of the distribution are estimated using the maximum likelihood and Bayes methods. A real data set is introduced and analyzed using three models. The first model is the bivariate Cauchy distribution, the second is the truncated bivariate Cauchy distribution and the third is the bivariate truncated generalized Cauchy distribution. A comparison is carried out between the mentioned models based on the corresponding Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test statistic to emphasize that the bivariate truncated generalized Cauchy model fits the data better than the other models.","Generalized Cauchy distribution,Moment generating function,Mixed moments,Correlation coefficient,Skewness,Kurtosis,Maximum likelihood estimation,Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique,Monte Carlo integration",,"Ateya, Saieed F.@Taif Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hawia, Taif, Saudi Arabia@Assiut Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Assiut, Egypt::Madhagi, Elham A.@Hodeidah Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Math, Al Hudaydah, Yemen","Ateya, Saieed F.@Unknow::Madhagi, Elham A.@Unknow",not exist,"A class of multivariate distributions and new copulas+AL-Hussaini, E.

A new rank correlation measure,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0423-0,MAY 2013,25,3,"A new rank correlation measure beta (n) is proposed, so as to develop a nonparametric test of independence for two variables. beta (n) is shown to be the symmetrized version of a measure earlier proposed by Borroni and Zenga (Stat Methods Appl 16:289-308, 2007). More specifically, beta (n) is built so that it can take the opposite sign, without changing its absolute value, when the ranking of one variable is reversed. Further, the meaning of the population equivalent of beta (n) is discussed. It is pointed out that this latter association measure vanishes not only at independence but, more generally, at indifference, that is when the two variables do not show any ""tendency"" to positive or negative dependence. The null distribution of beta (n) needs an independent study: hence, the finite null variance and a table of critical values are determined. Moreover, the asymptotic null distribution of beta (n) is derived. Finally, the performance of the test based on beta (n) is evaluated by simulation. beta (n) is shown to be a good competitor of some classical tests for the same problem.","Nonparametrics,Rank correlation,Association measures,Indifference,Gini's gamma","ASSOCIATION COEFFICIENT,BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS,SYMMETRIC FOOTRULE,INDEPENDENCE,TESTS,CONCORDANCE","Borroni, Claudio Giovanni@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Borroni, Claudio Giovanni@University of Milano-Bicocca","BORRONI, CLAUDIO GIOVANNI@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1251-9988","A multivariate version of Gini's rank association coefficient+Behboodian, Javad; Dolati, Ali; Ubeda-Flores, Manuel+STATISTICAL PAPERS+APR 2007::CLASS OF NONPARAMETRIC-TESTS FOR INDEPENDENCE IN BIVARIATE POPULATIONS+BHUCHONGKUL, S+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1964::A test of concordance based on Gini's mean difference+Borroni, Claudio Giovanni; Zenga, Michele+STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS+2007::On the asymptotic distribution of a general measure of monotone dependence+Cifarelli, DM; Conti, PL; Regazzini, E+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1996::Some contribution to the theory of monotone dependence+Cifarelli, DM; Regazzini, E.+Tech.

On the existence of a normal approximation to the distribution of the ratio of two independent normal random variables,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0429-2,MAY 2013,16,9,"The distribution of the ratio of two independent normal random variables X and Y is heavy tailed and has no moments. The shape of its density can be unimodal, bimodal, symmetric, asymmetric, and/or even similar to a normal distribution close to its mode. To our knowledge, conditions for a reasonable normal approximation to the distribution of Z = X/Y have been presented in scientific literature only through simulations and empirical results. A proof of the existence of a proposed normal approximation to the distribution of Z, in an interval I centered at beta = E(X) /E(Y), is given here for the case where both X and Y are independent, have positive means, and their coefficients of variation fulfill some conditions. In addition, a graphical informative way of assessing the closeness of the distribution of a particular ratio X/Y to the proposed normal approximation is suggested by means of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.","Coefficient of variation,Ratio of normal means,ROC curve",FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTION,"Diaz-Frances, Eloisa@Ctr Invest Matemat CIMAT, Guanajuato 36000, Gto, Mexico::Rubio, Francisco J.@Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","Diaz-Frances, Eloisa@CIMAT - Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas::Rubio, Francisco J.@University of Warwick","Rubio, Francisco Javier@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7183-8407","Significance and statistical errors in the analysis of DNA microarray data+Brody, JP; Williams, BA; Wold, BJ; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+OCT 1 2002::Some logical aspects of the linear functional relationship+Chamberlin, S.

Approximate MLEs for the location and scale parameters of the skew logistic distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0436-3,MAY 2013,12,2,"Azzalini (Scand J Stat 12:171-178, 1985) provided a methodology to introduce skewness in a normal distribution. Using the same method of Azzalini (1985), the skew logistic distribution can be easily obtained by introducing skewness to the logistic distribution. For the skew logistic distribution, the likelihood equations do not provide explicit solutions for the location and scale parameters. We present a simple method of deriving explicit estimators by approximating the likelihood equations appropriately. We examine numerically the bias and variance of these estimators and show that these estimators are as efficient as the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs). The coverage probabilities of the pivotal quantities (for location and scale parameters) based on asymptotic normality are shown to be unsatisfactory, especially when the effective sample size is small. To improve the coverage probabilities and for constructing confidence intervals, we suggest the use of simulated percentage points. Finally, we present a numerical example to illustrate the methods of inference developed here.","Maximum-likelihood estimator,Monte Carlo simulation,Pivotal quantity,Skew logistic distribution",,"Asgharzadeh, A.@Univ Mazandaran, Dept Stat, Babol Sar, Iran::Esmaily, L.@Univ Mazandaran, Dept Stat, Babol Sar, Iran::Nadarajah, S.@Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Asgharzadeh, A.@University of Mazandaran::Esmaily, L.@University of Mazandaran::Nadarajah, S.@University of Manchester",not exist,"no title+Arnold, B; Balakrishnan, N.+Relations, bounds and approximations for order statistics+1989::Point and interval estimation for a generalized logistic distribution under progressive Type II censoring+Asgharzadeh, A.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2006::A CLASS OF DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE NORMAL ONES+AZZALINI, A+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1985::Statistical aspects of fiber and bundle strength in hybrid composites+Badar, MG; Priest, AM.+PROGR SCI ENG COMPOS+1982::Inference for the type II generalized logistic distribution under progressive type II censoring+Balakrishnan, N; Hossain, A.+Commun Stat Simul Comput+2007::Inference for the scaled half-logistic distribution based on progressively type-II censored samples+Balakrishnan, N; Asgharzadeh, A+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2005::no title+David, H.

The simplicity of likelihood based inferences for P(X < Y) and for the ratio of means in the exponential model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0446-1,MAY 2013,22,3,"The profile likelihood of the reliability parameter theta = P(X < Y) or of the ratio of means, when X and Y are independent exponential random variables, has a simple analytical expression and is a powerful tool for making inferences. Inferences about theta can be given in terms of likelihood-confidence intervals with a simple algebraic structure even for small and unequal samples. The case of right censored data can also be handled in a simple way. This is in marked contrast with the complicated expressions that depend on cumbersome numerical calculations of multidimensional integrals required to obtain asymptotic confidence intervals that have been traditionally presented in scientific literature.","Comparison of exponential distributions,Exponential right censored data,Exponential stress-strength models,Profile likelihood of reliability parameter,ROC curves",X),"Diaz-Frances, Eloisa@Ctr Invest Matemat, Dept Probabil & Stat, Guanajuato 36000, Gto, Mexico::Montoya, Jose A.@Univ Sonora, Hermosillo 83000, Son, Mexico","Diaz-Frances, Eloisa@CIMAT - Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas::Montoya, Jose A.@Universidad de Sonora",not exist,"AN ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, GEP; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1964::ON COMPARING ESTIMATORS OF PR(Y LESS-THAN X) IN THE EXPONENTIAL CASE+CHAO, A+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+1982::A note on the UMVUE of Pr(X&lt;Y) in the exponential case+Cramer, E; Kamps, U+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1997::Enhanced inhibitory avoidance learning prevents the long-term memory-impairing effects of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor+Diaz-Trujillo, Arnulfo; Contreras, Joey; Medina, Andrea C.; et al.+NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY+MAR 2009::ESTIMATION OF PROBABILITY THAT Y LESS-THAN X+ENIS, P; GEISSER, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::Estimation of Pr[X &amp;GT; Y] for gamma distributions+Ismail, R.; Jeyaratnam, S.; Panchapakesan, S.+Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation+1986::A note on inference for P(X &lt; Y) for right truncated exponentially distributed data+Jiang, L.; Wong, A.

Using p values to design statistical process control charts,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0447-0,MAY 2013,29,9,"Conventional Phase II statistical process control (SPC) charts are designed using control limits; a chart gives a signal of process distributional shift when its charting statistic exceeds a properly chosen control limit. To do so, we only know whether a chart is out-of-control at a given time. It is therefore not informative enough about the likelihood of a potential distributional shift. In this paper, we suggest designing the SPC charts using p values. By this approach, at each time point of Phase II process monitoring, the p value of the observed charting statistic is computed, under the assumption that the process is in-control. If the p value is less than a pre-specified significance level, then a signal of distributional shift is delivered. This p value approach has several benefits, compared to the conventional design using control limits. First, after a signal of distributional shift is delivered, we could know how strong the signal is. Second, even when the p value at a given time point is larger than the significance level, it still provides us useful information about how stable the process performs at that time point. The second benefit is especially useful when we adopt a variable sampling scheme, by which the sampling time can be longer when we have more evidence that the process runs stably, supported by a larger p value. To demonstrate the p value approach, we consider univariate process monitoring by cumulative sum control charts in various cases.","Bootstrap,Cumulative sum control charts,Process monitoring,Self-starting,Variable sampling","VARIABLE SAMPLING INTERVALS,EWMA CONTROL CHARTS,ESTIMATED PARAMETERS,CUSUM,SCHEMES,SIZES,MODEL","Li, Zhonghua@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China::Qiu, Peihua@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Chatterjee, Snigdhansu@Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA::Wang, Zhaojun@Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China@Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China","Li, Zhonghua@Nankai University::Qiu, Peihua@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Chatterjee, Snigdhansu@University of Minnesota System@University of Minnesota Twin Cities::Wang, Zhaojun@Nankai University",not exist,"DISTRIBUTION-FREE CUMULATIVE SUM CONTROL CHARTS USING BOOTSTRAP-BASED CONTROL LIMITS+Chatterjee, Snigdhansu; Qiu, Peihua+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2009::Joint (X)over-bar and R charts with variable parameters+Costa, AFB+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1998::no title+Efron, B.; Tibshirani, R.; Tibshirani, R.

If the error variances are known, the empirical log-likelihood ratio is proved to be asymptotic chi-square distribution under the assumption that the errors are given by a sequence of stationary alpha-mixing random variables. Furthermore, if the error variances are unknown, we show that the proposed statistic is asymptotically standard chi-square distribution when the errors are independent.

The log-beta Weibull regression model with application to predict recurrence of prostate cancer,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0414-1,FEB 2013,24,9,"We study the properties of the called log-beta Weibull distribution defined by the logarithm of the beta Weibull random variable (Famoye et al. in J Stat Theory Appl 4:121-136, 2005; Lee et al. in J Mod Appl Stat Methods 6:173-186, 2007). An advantage of the new distribution is that it includes as special sub-models classical distributions reported in the lifetime literature. We obtain formal expressions for the moments, moment generating function, quantile function and mean deviations. We construct a regression model based on the new distribution to predict recurrence of prostate cancer for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated by open radical prostatectomy. It can be applied to censored data since it represents a parametric family of models that includes as special sub-models several widely-known regression models. The regression model was fitted to a data set of 1,324 eligible prostate cancer patients. We can predict recurrence free probability after the radical prostatectomy in terms of highly significant clinical and pathological explanatory variables associated with the recurrence of the disease. The predicted probabilities of remaining free of cancer progression are calculated under two nested models.","Beta Weibull distribution,Censored data,Log-beta Weibull distribution,Log-Weibull regression model,Survival function","POSTOPERATIVE NOMOGRAM,RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY,DISTRIBUTIONS,FAMILY","Ortega, Edwin M.

The parameterization of the distribution in terms of shape parameters and the lack of simple expressions for its mean and variance hinder, however, its utilization with modeling purposes. The paper presents two median-dispersion re-parameterizations of the Kumaraswamy distribution aimed at facilitating its use in regression models in which both the location and the dispersion parameters are functions of their own distinct sets of covariates, and in latent-variable and other models estimated through simulation-based methods. In both re-parameterizations the dispersion parameter establishes a quantile-spread order among Kumaraswamy distributions with the same median and support. The study also describes the behavior of the re-parameterized distributions, determines some of their limiting distributions, and discusses the potential comparative advantages of using them in the context of regression modeling and simulation-based estimation.","Kumaraswamy distribution,Beta distribution,Median-dispersion parameterization,Quantile-spread order,Limiting distributions,Regression modeling,Generalized linear models,Latent-variable models,Simulation-based estimation methods","PROBABILITY DENSITY-FUNCTION,BETA-REGRESSION,INFLUENCE DIAGNOSTICS,VARYING DISPERSION,SPREAD,YIELD,PROPORTIONS,MOMENTS,CURVES,MATCH","Mitnik, Pablo A.@Stanford Univ, Ctr Study Poverty & Inequal, Stanford, CA 94305 USA::Baek, Sunyoung@Stanford Univ, Ctr Study Poverty & Inequal, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Mitnik, Pablo A.@Unknow::Baek, Sunyoung@Unknow",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.

In addition, the estimators of alpha, when c is known using an RSS version based on the order statistic that maximizes the Fisher information for a fixed set size, will be considered. These estimators will be compared in terms of their biases and mean square errors.

In this work, under the assumption X/U and U are independent, and X/U has a distribution, we characterize the distribution of (U, X) by the condition E(h(U - X)|X) = b, where h is allowed to be a linear combination of exponential functions. Since the assumption for X and U above is equivalent to X|U being scaled by U, hence our results can be viewed as identification of a power distribution mixture.","Beta distribution,Characterization,Constant regression,Conditional expectation,Gamma distribution,Mixture distributions","CONDITIONAL MOMENTS,GAMMA DISTRIBUTION","Huang, Wen-Jang@Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Math, Kaohsiung 81148, Taiwan::Su, Nan-Cheng@Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Stat, Tainan 70101, Taiwan","Huang, Wen-Jang@Unknow::Su, Nan-Cheng@Unknow",not exist,"Three dual regression schemes for the Lukacs theorem+Bobecka, K; Wesolowski, J+METRIKA+2002::Bivariate Lukacs type regression characterizations+Bobecka, K; Wesolowski, J.+Newdevelopments in applied statistics research+2008::CHARACTERIZATIONS OF SOME DISTRIBUTIONS BY CONDITIONAL MOMENTS+BOLGER, EM; HARKNESS, WL+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1965::Characterizations of the gamma distribution via conditional moments+Chou, C.-W.; Huang, W.-J.+Sankhyd+2003::Uniform mixtures via posterior means+Gupta, AK; Wesolowski, J+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1997::Regressional identifiability and identification for beta mixtures+Gupta, AK; Wesolowski, J.+Stat Decis+2001::CHARACTERIZATIONS OF GAMMA DISTRIBUTION+HALL, WJ; SIMONS, G+SANKHYA-THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS SERIES A+1969::On some characterizations of the mixture of gamma distributions+Huang, Wen-Jang; Chang, Shu-Huey+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1 2007::On a study of renewal process connected with certain conditional moments+Huang, WJ; Su, JC.+Sankhya A+1997::Some characterization results based on certain conditional expectations+Huang, WJ; Liu, C-H.+Technical Report+2006::Characterizations of the gamma distribution via conditional expectations+Huang, WJ; Chou, CW.+Technical Report+2004::On a study of beta and geometric mixtures by conditional moments+Huang, WJ; Wong, HL.+Technical Report+1998::CHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE POISSON-PROCESS AS A RENEWAL PROCESS VIA 2 CONDITIONAL MOMENTS+LI, SH; HUANG, WJ; HUANG, MNL+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+JUN 1994::A CHARACTERIZATION OF THE GAMMA DISTRIBUTION+LUKACS, E+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1955::A functional equation and its application to the characterization of gamma distributions+Meszaros, Fruzsina+AEQUATIONES MATHEMATICAE+MAR 2010::A CONSTANT REGRESSION CHARACTERIZATION OF THE GAMMA LAW+WESOLOWSKI, J+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+JUN 1990::A characterization of the gamma process by conditional moments+Wesolowski, J.+Metrika+1989"

A Dirichlet process (DP) prior is assigned to mixing distribution. We also assume prior distributions for the mode and the skewed component. A computational approach is used to obtain the Bayes estimate of the components. An example is given to illustrate the approach.,"Dirichlet process,Gibbs sampler,Skew-symmetric,Skewness,Unimodal density",,"Mostofi, A.

A general threshold stress hybrid hazard model for lifetime data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0386-1,NOV 2012,44,3,"In this paper we propose a hybrid hazard regression model with threshold stress which includes the proportional hazards and the accelerated failure time models as particular cases. To express the behavior of lifetimes the generalized-gamma distribution is assumed and an inverse power law model with a threshold stress is considered. For parameter estimation we develop a sampling-based posterior inference procedure based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. We assume proper but vague priors for the parameters of interest. A simulation study investigates the frequentist properties of the proposed estimators obtained under the assumption of vague priors. Further, some discussions on model selection criteria are given. The methodology is illustrated on simulated and real lifetime data set.","Bayesian inference,Proportional hazard and accelerated failure models,Survival analysis,Threshold stress,Gamma-generalized distribution,MCMC Method","CENSORED SURVIVAL-DATA,GAMMA-DISTRIBUTION,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,REGRESSION-MODELS,TESTS","Tojeiro, Cynthia A.

Estimation of variance components in linear mixed measurement error models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0387-0,NOV 2012,29,6,"In this paper, we consider a linear mixed model with measurement errors in fixed effects. We find the corrected score function estimators for the variance components. An iterative algorithm is proposed for estimating the parameters. The computations on each iteration of this algorithm are those associated with computing estimates of fixed and random effects for given values of the variance components. We also derive the consistency of the estimators under regularity conditions. The simulation study shows that for relatively small sample size the corrected estimators perform very well.

Simultaneous estimation of restricted location parameters based on permutation and sign-change,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0396-z,NOV 2012,17,0,"The problem of simultaneously estimating location parameters is addressed, where the vector of location parameters belongs to a polyhedral cone including simple order, tree order and positive orthant restrictions and so forth. This paper proposes modified estimators based on orthogonal transformations such as sign-change and permutation and proves that, in a multivariate location family, the modified estimators are minimax under quadratic loss. Shrinkage minimax estimators improving on the modified estimators are obtained for a restricted mean vector of spherically symmetric distribution.

Moreover, parameter estimation is also addressed. Supposing that the timepoints of the outliers are known but their sizes are unknown, we prove that the conditional least squares (CLS) estimators of the offspring and innovation means are strongly consistent. In contrast, however, the CLS estimators of the outliers' sizes are not strongly consistent, although they converge to a random limit with probability 1. We also prove that the joint CLS estimator of the offspring and innovation means is asymptotically normal. Conditionally on the values of the process at the timepoints neighboring to the outliers' occurrences, the joint CLS estimator of the sizes of the outliers is also asymptotically normal.","Integer-valued autoregressive models,Additive outliers,Conditional least squares estimators,Strong consistency,Conditional asymptotic normality",TIME-SERIES,"Barczy, Matyas@Univ Debrecen, Fac Informat, H-4010 Debrecen, Hungary::Ispany, Marton@Univ Debrecen, Fac Informat, H-4010 Debrecen, Hungary::Pap, Gyula@Univ Szeged, Bolyai Inst, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary::Scotto, Manuel@Univ Aveiro, Dept Matemat, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal::Silva, Maria Eduarda@Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal","Barczy, Matyas@University of Debrecen::Ispany, Marton@University of Debrecen::Pap, Gyula@Szeged University::Scotto, Manuel@Universidade de Aveiro::Silva, Maria Eduarda@Universidade do Porto","nipe, cef@A-4218-2010::Silva, Maria Eduarda@C-6194-2009@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2972-2050::Scotto, Manuel@F-6020-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8427-2684::Ispany, Marton@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2198-1816","Expectation - Maximization algorithms and the estimation of time series models in the presence of outliers+Abraham, B.; Chuang, A.+J.

Under integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) models, the properties of these two residuals are investigated and used to evaluate the predictive performance and model adequacy of the INAR models.

A measure of asymmetry,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0401-6,NOV 2012,15,4,"It is a general practice to make assertions about the symmetry or asymmetry of a probability density function based on the coefficients of skewness. Since most of the coefficients of skewness are designed to be zero for a symmetric density, they overall do provide an indication of symmetry. However, skewness is primarily influenced by the tail behavior of a density function, and the skewness coefficients are designed to capture this behavior. Thus they do not calibrate asymmetry in the density curves. We provide a necessary condition for a probability density function to be symmetric and use that to measure asymmetry in a continuous density curve on the scale of -1 to 1. We show through examples that the proposed measure does an admirable job of capturing the visual impression of asymmetry of a continuous density function.","Asymmetry measure,Correlation,Nonparametric,Skewness","SYMMETRY,SKEWNESS","Patil, P.

In particular we compare methods of fitting via minimizing a Cram,r Von Mises distance, an L (2) minimum distance estimator, and fitting a B-optimal M-estimator. After a brief prelude on robust estimation explaining the merits in terms of weak continuity and Fr,chet differentiability of all the aforesaid estimators from an asymptotic point of view, a comparison is drawn with classical estimation and fitting. In summary, we give a practical example where minimizing a Cram,r Von Mises distance is both efficacious in terms of efficiency and robustness as well as being easily implemented. Here gamma distributions arise naturally for ""in control"" representation indicators from measurements of spectra when using fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. However, estimating the in-control parameters for these distributions is often difficult, due to the occasional occurrence of outliers.","Gamma distributions,Frechet differentiability,Weak continuity,Robust estimation,Minimum distance estimation","MINIMUM DISTANCE ESTIMATORS,FRECHET DIFFERENTIABILITY,FUNCTIONALS,INFERENCE,PROPORTION,PARAMETER,LOCATION,MIXTURE,MODEL","Clarke, Brenton R.@Murdoch Univ, Sch Chem & Math Sci, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia::McKinnon, Peter L.@Curtin Univ Technol, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia::Riley, Geoff@Alcoa World Alumina, Technol Delivery Grp, Kwinana, WA 6966, Australia","Clarke, Brenton R.@Murdoch University::McKinnon, Peter L.@Curtin University::Riley, Geoff@Alcoa","Clarke, Brenton R@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1419-0768","CHARACTERIZATIONS OF GAMMA, INVERSE GAUSSIAN, AND NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTIONS VIA THEIR LENGTH-BIASED DISTRIBUTIONS+AHMED, AN; ABOUAMMOH, AM+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 1993::no title+Andrews, D.

Shrinkage averaging estimation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0405-2,NOV 2012,34,5,"We discuss the impact of tuning parameter selection uncertainty in the context of shrinkage estimation and propose a methodology to account for problems arising from this issue: Transferring established concepts from model averaging to shrinkage estimation yields the concept of shrinkage averaging estimation (SAE) which reflects the idea of using weighted combinations of shrinkage estimators with different tuning parameters to improve overall stability, predictive performance and standard errors of shrinkage estimators. Two distinct approaches for an appropriate weight choice, both of which are inspired by concepts from the recent literature of model averaging, are presented: The first approach relates to an optimal weight choice with regard to the predictive performance of the final weighted estimator and its implementation can be realized via quadratic programming. The second approach has a fairly different motivation and considers the construction of weights via a resampling experiment. Focusing on Ridge, Lasso and Random Lasso estimators, the properties of the proposed shrinkage averaging estimators resulting from these strategies are explored by means of Monte-Carlo studies and are compared to traditional approaches where the tuning parameter is simply selected via cross validation criteria. The results show that the proposed SAE methodology can improve an estimators' overall performance and reveal and incorporate tuning parameter uncertainty. As an illustration, selected methods are applied to some recent data from a study on leadership behavior in life science companies.","Tuning parameter selection uncertainty,Model averaging,Model selection,Optimal weight choice,Cross validation","VARIABLE SELECTION,LINEAR-REGRESSION,MODEL,LASSO","Schomaker, Michael@Univ Cape Town, Ctr Infect Dis & Epidemiol Res, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa","Schomaker, Michael@University of Cape Town","Schomaker, Michael@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8475-0591","SUBMODEL SELECTION AND EVALUATION IN REGRESSION - THE X-RANDOM CASE+BREIMAN, L; SPECTOR, P+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1992::On properties of predictors derived with a two-step bootstrap model averaging approach - A simulation study in the linear regression model+Buchholz, Anika; Hollaender, Norbert; Sauerbrei, Willi+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 20 2008::Model selection: an integral part of inference+Buckland, TS; Burnham, PK; Augustin, HN.+Biometrics+1997::no title+Burnham, K.

Uniformly most powerful unbiased test for shoulder condition in point transect sampling,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0406-1,NOV 2012,13,0,"Point transect sampling is a well-known methodology for estimating wildlife population density. In this context, the usual approach is to assume a model for the detection function. Thus, the estimate depends on the shape of the detection function. In particular, the estimation is influenced by the so-called shoulder condition, which guarantees that detection is nearly certain at small distances from the observer. For instance, the half-normal model satisfies this condition, whereas the negative exponential model does not. Testing whether the shoulder condition is consistent with data is a crucial issue. In this paper we propose the uniformly most powerful unbiased test for the shoulder condition in the exponential mixture model of the half-normal and the negative exponential. Critical values of the proposed test are calculated for large samples by means of asymptotic distribution theory and for small samples via Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, a case study is presented.","Distance sampling,Detection function,Shoulder condition,Uniformly most powerful unbiased test,Exponential Family",,"Borgoni, Riccardo@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, I-20126 Milan, Italy::Quatto, Piero@Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Borgoni, Riccardo@University of Milano-Bicocca::Quatto, Piero@University of Milano-Bicocca",not exist,"Local parametric density estimation methods in line transect sampling+Barabesi, L.+Metron+2001::Comparing estimators of animal abundance: a simula-QUATTO tion study+BORGONI, R.; CAMELETTI, M.+Atti del Convegno della Societa Italiana di Statistica  Statistica e Ambiente+2005::On the uniformly most powerful invariant test for the shoulder condition in line transect sampling+Borgoni, R; Quatto, P.+Stat Appl+2009::no title+Buckland, S.

A generalized multivariate beta distribution: control charting when the measurements are from an exponential distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0407-0,NOV 2012,8,3,In Statistical Process Control (SPC) there exists a need to model the run-length distribution of a Q-chart that monitors the process mean when measurements are from an exponential distribution with an unknown parameter. To develop exact expressions for the probabilities of run-lengths the joint distribution of the charting statistics is needed. This gives rise to a new distribution that can be regarded as a generalized multivariate beta distribution. An overview of the problem statement as identified in the field of SPC is given and the newly developed generalized multivariate beta distribution is proposed. Statistical properties of this distribution are studied and the effect of the parameters of this generalized multivariate beta distribution on the correlation between two variables is also discussed.,"Multivariate beta,Chi-squared,Statistical Process Control,Run-length,Shewhart,Hypergeometric functions,Correlation",,"Adamski, K.@Univ Pretoria, Dept Stat, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa::Human, S.

Monitoring the conforming fraction of high-quality processes using a control chart p under a small sample size and an alternative estimator,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0356-z,AUG 2012,23,2,"In this paper, we propose to change the traditional monitored statistic in a control chart p, by changing the sampling proportion to a new statistics denoted as . We aim to minimize problems in designing the control chart p for high quality processes when only a small sample size is available. The idea of the new statistics is simple, as it involves taking two independent samples of a Bernoulli population. From each sample, the sampling proportion is calculated, and the new statistic to monitor is the weighted mean of the sampling proportion of each sample employed to weight the overall sampling proportion. We note that the control chart p that employs the new statistic provides more in-control values of average run length closer to the usual fixed value of 370 than the traditional statistic, that is, the sampling proportion. Numerical examples illustrate the new proposal.","Estimator for parameter of conformance fraction,Mean square error,Control charts p,Average run length","RECORD SYSTEMS ESTIMATION,CAPTURE-RECAPTURE,RISK DIFFERENCE,METAANALYSIS,SPARSE","Ho, Linda Lee@EPUSP, Dept Prod Engn, Sao Paulo, Brazil::Quinino, Roberto da Costa@Univ Fed Minas Gerais, ICEx, Depto Estat, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil::Suyama, Emilio@Univ Fed Minas Gerais, ICEx, Depto Estat, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil::Lourenco, Ruth Pereira@EPUSP, Dept Prod Engn, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Ho, Linda Lee@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Quinino, Roberto da Costa@Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais::Suyama, Emilio@Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais::Lourenco, Ruth Pereira@Universidade de Sao Paulo","Lee Ho, Linda@F-7881-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9984-8711","Revisiting proportion estimators+Bohning, D; Viwatwongkasem, C+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+2005::Chance mechanisms underlying univariate distributions, statistical ecology+Boswell, MT; Ord, JK; Patil, GP.+Statistical distributions in ecological work+1979::no title+Carlin, B.

A review of preliminary test-based statistical methods for the benefit of Six Sigma quality practitioners,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-010-0359-9,AUG 2012,26,4,"Ever since Professor Bancroft developed inference procedures using preliminary tests there has been a lot of research in this area by various authors across the world. This could be evidenced from two papers that widely reviewed the publications on preliminary test-based statistical methods. The use of preliminary tests in solving doubts arising over the model parameters has gained momentum as it has proven to be effective and powerful over to that of classical methods. Unfortunately, there has been a downward trend in research related to preliminary tests as it could be seen from only few recent publications. Obviously, the benefits of preliminary test-based statistical methods did not reach Six Sigma practitioners as the concept of Six Sigma just took off and it was in a premature state. In this paper, efforts have been made to present a review of the publications on the preliminary test-based statistical methods. Though studies on preliminary test-based methods have been done in various areas of statistics such as theory of estimation, hypothesis testing, analysis of variance, regression analysis, reliability, to mention a few, only few important methods are presented here for the benefit of readers, particularly Six Sigma quality practitioners, to understand the concept. In this regard, the define, measure, analyze, improve and control methodology of six sigma is presented with a link of analyze phase to preliminary test-based statistical methods. Examples are also given to illustrate the procedures.","Analysis of variance,Classical statistical methods,DMAIC cycle,Preliminary test-based statistical methods,Six Sigma","INCOMPLETELY SPECIFIED MODELS,CONDITIONAL SPECIFICATION,INFERENCE,VARIANCE","Ravichandran, J.@Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Dept Math, Coimbatore 641105, Tamil Nadu, India","Ravichandran, J.@Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University","Joghee, Ravichandran@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8284-8851","On biases in estimation due to the use of preliminary tests of significance+Bancroft, TA+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1944::ANALYSIS + INFERENCE FOR INCOMPLETELY SPECIFIED MODELS INVOLVING USE OF PRELIMINARY TEST(S) OF SIGNIFICANCE+BANCROFT, TA+BIOMETRICS+1964::INFERENCE BASED ON CONDITIONAL SPECIFICATION - NOTE AND A BIBLIOGRAPHY+BANCROFT, TA; HAN, CP+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1977::ON THE USE OF PRELIMINARY TESTS IN CERTAIN STATISTICAL PROCEDURES+BENNETT, BM+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+1956::Optimizing data warehouse design+Boroditsky, V; Molinare, C.+Six Sigma Forum Mag+2006::POWER OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE TEST PROCEDURES FOR CERTAIN INCOMPLETELY SPECIFIED MODELS .1.+BOZIVICH, H; BANCROFT, TA; HARTLEY, HO+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1956::Preliminary test estimation of the parameters of exponential and Pareto distribution for censored samples+Golam Kibria, BM; Saleh, AKMdE.+STAT PAPERS+2008::Capability indices: mystery solved+Gregory, RII.+Six Sigma Forum Mag+2005::INFERENCE BASED ON CONDITIONAL SPECIFICATION - A 2ND BIBLIOGRAPHY+HAN, CP; RAO, CV; RAVICHANDRAN, J+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1988::ON POOLING MEANS WHEN VARIANCE IS UNKNOWN+HAN, CP; BANCROFT, TA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1968::Inference for some incompletely specified models involving normal approximations to discrete data+Kale, PK; Bancroft, TA.+Biometrics+1967::Application of ANN in six sigma DMADV and its comparison with regression analysis in view of a case study in a leading steel industry+Kuthe, A.M.; Tharakan, B.D.+International Journal of Six Sigma and Competitive Advantage+2009::THE TEACHERS CORNER - INTERPOLATION IN F-TABLES+LAUBSCHER, NF+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+1965::Lean six sigma's evolution+Mader, D.P.+Quality Progress+Jan. 2008::no title+Mardia, KV; Zemroch, PJ.+Tables of the F- and Related Distributions with Algorithms+1978::Six-sigma quality programs+McFadden, FR.+Qual Prog+1993::no title+Ravichandran, J.+Inference based on conditional specification in two-stage unbalanced nested design+1988::The performance of treatments in single-factor experiments using Six Sigma metrics+Ravichandran, J.+International Journal of Six Sigma and Competitive Advantage+2008::On power function of a conditionally specified test procedure in an unbalanced random effects model+Ravichandran, J; Rao, CV.+J Indian Soc Agri Stat+1989::AN APPROXIMATE DISTRIBUTION OF ESTIMATES OF VARIANCE COMPONENTS+SATTERTHWAITE, FE+BIOMETRICS BULLETIN+1946::no title+Snedecor, G.

Discrete approximations of continuous and mixed measures on a compact interval,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0365-6,AUG 2012,21,13,"When considering a mixed probability measure on [0, 1] with atoms in zero and one, the frontier points have to be treated (and ""weighted"") differently and separately with respect to the interior points. In order to avoid the troublesome consequences of a mixed model, an easily interpretable discretization of [0, 1] on uniformly spaced atoms is here proposed. This ""homogeneous support"" is used to define two discrete models, a parametric and a nonparametric one. An application to real data on recovery risk of the Bank of Italy's loans is here considered to exemplify both discretization and proposed models.

Componentwise B-spline estimation for varying coefficient models with longitudinal data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0369-2,AUG 2012,24,5,A componentwise B-spline method is proposed for estimating the unknown functions in the varying-coefficient models with longitudinal data. Different amounts of smoothing are used for different individual coefficient functions and the estimators of different coefficient functions are obtained by different minimization operations. The local asymptotic bias and variance of the estimators are derived. It is shown that our estimators achieve the local and global optimal convergence rates even if the coefficient functions belong to different smoothness families. The asymptotic distributions of the estimators are also established and are used to construct approximate pointwise confidence intervals for coefficient functions. Finite sample properties of our procedures are studied through Monte Carlo simulations.,"Varying coefficient models,Longitudinal data,Componentwise B-spline estimators,Optimal convergence rate,Different smoothness families","CONFIDENCE-REGIONS,LINEAR-MODELS,CONVERGENCE,REGRESSION,RATES","Tang Qingguo@Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China@PLA Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Sci, Nanjing 210007, Jiangsu, Peoples R China::Cheng Longsheng@Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Tang Qingguo@PLA University of Science & Technology@Nanjing University of Science & Technology::Cheng Longsheng@Nanjing University of Science & Technology,not exist,"ASYMPTOTIC INTEGRATED MEAN-SQUARE ERROR USING LEAST-SQUARES AND BIAS MINIMIZING SPLINES+AGARWAL, GG; STUDDEN, WJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1980::ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF BEST L2[0,1] APPROXIMATION BY SPLINES WITH VARIABLE KNOTS+BARROW, DL; SMITH, PW+QUARTERLY OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS+1978::PROBABILITY-INEQUALITIES FOR SUM OF INDEPENDENT RANDOM-VARIABLES+BENNETT, G+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1962::Efficient estimation and inferences for varying-coefficient models+Cai, ZW; Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2000::no title+De Boor, C.+A Practical Guide to Splines+1978::Smoothing spline estimation in varying-coefficient models+Eubank, RL; Huang, CF; Maldonado, YM; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2004::Two-step estimation of functional linear models with applications to longitudinal data+Fan, JQ; Zhang, JT+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::Nonparametric smoothing estimates of time-varying coefficient models with longitudinal data+Hoover, DR; Rice, JA; Wu, CO; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1998::Varying-coefficient models and basis function approximations for the analysis of repeated measurements+Huang, JHZ; Wu, CO; Zhou, L+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2002::Polynomial spline estimation and inference for varying coefficient models with longitudinal data+Huang, JHZ; Wu, CO; Zhou, L+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2004::Rates of convergence in semi-parametric modelling of longitudinal data+Moyeed, R.A.; Diggle, P.J.+Australian Journal of Statistics+mar 1994::ESTIMATING THE MEAN AND COVARIANCE STRUCTURE NONPARAMETRICALLY WHEN THE DATA ARE CURVES+RICE, JA; SILVERMAN, BW+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1991::no title+Schumaker, L.+Spline Functions: Basic Theory+1981::OPTIMAL GLOBAL RATES OF CONVERGENCE FOR NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION+STONE, CJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::OPTIMAL RATES OF CONVERGENCE FOR NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATORS+STONE, CJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1980::L-1-estimation for varying coefficient models+Tang, QG; Wang, JD+STATISTICS+OCT 2005::Reducing component estimation for varying coefficient models with longitudinal data+Tang QingGuo; Wang Jinde+SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES A-MATHEMATICS+FEB 2008::Asymptotic confidence regions for kernel smoothing of a varying-coefficient model with longitudinal data+Wu, CO; Chiang, CT; Hoover, DR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1998::Kernel smoothing on varying coefficient models with longitudinal dependent variable+Wu, CO; Chiang, CT+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2000::On the estimation and testing of functional-coefficient linear models+Xia, YC; Li, WK+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1999::Empirical likelihood for a varying coefficient model with longitudinal data+Xue, Liugen; Zhu, Lixing+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2007::SEMIPARAMETRIC MODELS FOR LONGITUDINAL DATA WITH APPLICATION TO CD4 CELL NUMBERS IN HIV SEROCONVERTERS+ZEGER, SL; DIGGLE, PJ+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1994::Variable bandwidth selection in varying-coefficient models+Zhang, WY; Lee, SY+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 2000::Local asymptotics for regression splines and confidence regions+Zhou, S; Shen, X; Wolfe, DA+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 1998"

On diagnostics in multivariate measurement error models under asymmetric heavy-tailed distributions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-011-0371-8,AUG 2012,24,3,"In this paper, we discuss the extension of some diagnostic procedures to multivariate measurement error models with scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions (Lachos et al., Statistics 44:541-556, 2010c). This class provides a useful generalization of normal (and skew-normal) measurement error models since the random term distributions cover symmetric, asymmetric and heavy-tailed distributions, such as skew-t, skew-slash and skew-contaminated normal, among others. Inspired by the EM algorithm proposed by Lachos et al. (Statistics 44:541-556, 2010c), we develop a local influence analysis for measurement error models, following Zhu and Lee's (J R Stat Soc B 63:111-126, 2001) approach. This is because the observed data log-likelihood function associated with the proposed model is somewhat complex and Cook's well-known approach can be very difficult to apply to achieve local influence measures. Some useful perturbation schemes are also discussed. In addition, a score test for assessing the homogeneity of the skewness parameter vector is presented. Finally, the methodology is exemplified through a real data set, illustrating the usefulness of the proposed methodology.","EM algorithm,Local influence,Mahalanobis distance,Measurement error models,Scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions","LOCAL INFLUENCE ANALYSIS,LINEAR MIXED MODELS,SKEW-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION,SCALE MIXTURES,REGRESSION-MODELS,T DISTRIBUTION","Zeller, Camila B.@Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Dept Stat, BR-36036330 Juiz De Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil::Carvalho, Rignaldo R.@Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Stat, BR-13083859 Sao Paulo, Brazil::Lachos, Victor H.@Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Stat, BR-13083859 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Zeller, Camila B.@Unknow::Carvalho, Rignaldo R.@Universidade Estadual de Campinas::Lachos, Victor H.@Universidade Estadual de Campinas",not exist,"SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::The multivariate skew-normal distribution+Azzalini, A; DallaValle, A+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::A general class of multivariate skew- elliptical distribution+Branco, MD; Dey, DK.+J Multivar Anal+2001::Bayesian nonlinear regression models with scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions: estimation and case influence diagnostics+Cancho, VG; Dey, DK; Lachos, VH<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Andrade, MG</span>.+Comput Stat Data Anal+2010::Clinical measurement of testicular volume in adolescents: Comparison of the reliability of 5 methods+Chipkevitch, E; Nishimura, RT; Tu, DGS; et al.+JOURNAL OF UROLOGY+DEC 1996::no title+Cook, R.

A simulation study demonstrates the capability of the model to detect over- and under-dispersion of the potential users group of the dataset in relation to the value of covariates, and to estimate the proportion of structural zeros with great accuracy. An application of the model to fit the number of children per family in relation to several covariates confirms the presence of structural zeros in fertility data at the same time as it detects under-dispersion in most of the levels determined by the covariates.","Count data,Hyper-Poisson,Over-dispersion,Under-dispersion,Zero inflation","COUNT DATA,INSURANCE","Saez-Castillo, Antonio J.@Univ Jaen, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Jaen, Spain::Conde-Sanchez, Antonio@Univ Jaen, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Jaen, Spain","Saez-Castillo, Antonio J.@Universidad de Jaen::Conde-Sanchez, Antonio@Universidad de Jaen","Saez-Castillo, Antonio Jose@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9795-9610::Conde Sanchez, Antonio@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0450-1585","Education and fertility: an investigation into Italian families+Aldieri, Luigi; Vinci, Concetto+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS+2012::A Bayesian analysis of zero-inflated generalized Poisson model+Angers, JF; Biswas, A+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+FEB 28 2003::Modeling zero-inflated count data when exposure varies: With an application to tumor counts+Baetschmann, Gregori; Winkelmann, Rainer+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+SEP 2013::2-PARAMETER FAMILY OF HYPER-POISSON DISTRIBUTIONS+BARDWELL, GE; CROW, EL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1964::no title+By, K.; Qaqish, B.+mvtBinaryEP: Generates correlated binary data+2011::Model selection for zero-inflated regression with missing covariates+Chen, Xue-Dong; Fu, Ying-Zi+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 1 2011::Local influence measure of zero-inflated generalized Poisson mixture regression models+Chen, Xue-Dong; Fu, Ying-Zi; Wang, Xue-Ren+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+APR 15 2013::Zero-inflated generalized Poisson regression mixture model for mapping quantitative trait loci underlying count trait with many zeros+Cui, Yuehua; Yang, Wenzhao+JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY+JAN 21 2009::Zero-inflated generalized Poisson models with regression effects on the mean, dispersion and zero-inflation level applied to patent outsourcing rates+Czado, Claudia; Erhardt, Vinzenz; Min, Aleksey; et al.+STATISTICAL MODELLING+JUL 2007::Non nested model selection for spatial count regression models with application to health insurance+Czado, Claudia; Schabenberger, Holger; Erhardt, Vinzenz+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAY 2014::A METHOD FOR GENERATING HIGH-DIMENSIONAL MULTIVARIATE BINARY VARIATES+EMRICH, LJ; PIEDMONTE, MR+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 1991::no title+Erhardt, V.+ZIGP: zero inflated generalized poisson (ZIGP) regression models+2011::Zero-inflated generalized Poisson regression model with an application to domestic violence data+Famoye, F.; Singh, K.+J.

Confidence intervals for population means of partially paired observations,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0686-y,MAR 2017,27,0,"We propose a new method to make inference about an eye parameter based on data that contains measurements on both eyes for some subjects, and measurements on only one eye on the others. Subject effects are modeled as additive and random, and correlation between observations on the same subject are taken into account. We derive confidence intervals for the parameter of interest, using unbiased estimators of mean and variance, and yielding explicit formulas. The results are compared to approaches commonly used in the literature, using theoretical considerations and a simulation study. The method works well even for small to moderate sample sizes, for continuous and for discrete data, and it is applicable generally for the situation where data is collected partially in pairs and partially in singles, and inference is to be made about a common location parameter. The conclusions as to how one should best average correlated data may be surprising, and somewhat revising conventional wisdom.","Confidence intervals,Correlated data,Nonnormality,Paired data,Partial information","STATISTICAL-METHODS,MISSING DATA,OPHTHALMOLOGY,EYES,OUTCOMES","Fuchs, Nicole@Salzburg Univ, Fachbereich Math, Hellbrunner Str 34, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria::Poelz, Werner@Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Appl Syst Sci & Stat, Altenberg Str 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria::Bathke, Arne C.@Salzburg Univ, Fachbereich Math, Hellbrunner Str 34, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria@Univ Kentucky, Dept Stat, Lexington, KY 40536 USA","Fuchs, Nicole@Salzburg University::Poelz, Werner@Johannes Kepler University of Linz::Bathke, Arne C.@University of Kentucky@Salzburg University",not exist,"Simple and effective confidence intervals for proportions and differences of proportions result from adding two successes and two failures+Agresti, A; Caffo, B+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+NOV 2000::Statistics notes - Units of analysis+Altman, DG; Bland, JM+BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL+JUN 28 1997::Statistical guidelines for the analysis of data obtained from one or both eyes+Armstrong, Richard A.+OPHTHALMIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS+JAN 2013::Ime4: Linear mixed-effects models using Eigen and S4+Bates, D.; Maechler, M.; Bolker, B.

Hypothesis test on response mean with inequality constraints under data missing when covariables are present,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0687-x,MAR 2017,16,1,"This paper addresses the problem of hypothesis test on response mean with various inequality constraints in the presence of covariates when response data are missing at random. The various hypotheses include to test single point, two points, set of inequalities as well as two-sided set of inequalities of the response mean. The test statistics is constructed by the weighted-corrected empirical likelihood function of the response mean based on the approach of weighted-corrected imputation for the response variable. We investigate limiting distributions and asymptotic powers of the proposed empirical likelihood ratio test statistics with auxiliary information. The results show that the test statistics with auxiliary information is more efficient than that without auxiliary information. A simulation study is undertaken to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed method.","Auxiliary information,Empirical likelihood,Hypothesis test,Inequality constraint,Missing data,Response mean","EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD INFERENCE,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,LINEAR-MODELS,IMPUTATION","Xu, Hong-Xia@Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China@Anhui Polytech Univ, Sch Math & Phys, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China::Fan, Guo-Liang@Anhui Polytech Univ, Sch Math & Phys, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China::Liang, Han-Ying@Tongji Univ, Dept Math, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Xu, Hong-Xia@Zhejiang Gongshang University@Anhui Polytechnic University::Fan, Guo-Liang@Anhui Polytechnic University::Liang, Han-Ying@Tongji University",not exist,"Empirical likelihood hypothesis test on mean with inequality constraints+Chen Li; Shi Jian+SCIENCE CHINA-MATHEMATICS+SEP 2011::Empirical likelihood ratio test for or against a set of inequality constraints+ElBarmi, H+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+OCT 30 1996::Empirical likelihood inference for partially time-varying coefficient errors-in-variables models+Fan, Guo-Liang; Xu, Hong-Xia; Liang, Han-Ying+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2012::Empirical likelihood for heteroscedastic partially linear errors-in-variables model with alpha-mixing errors+Fan, Guo-Liang; Liang, Han-Ying; Wang, Jiang-Feng+STATISTICAL PAPERS+FEB 2013::METHODOLOGY AND ALGORITHMS OF EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD+HALL, P; LASCALA, B+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 1990::no title+Hall, P.+The Bootstrap and Edgeworth Expansion+1992::Estimation in partially linear models with missing covariates+Liang, H; Wang, SJ; Robins, JM; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2004::EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD FOR LINEAR-MODELS+OWEN, A+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1991::EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD RATIO CONFIDENCE-REGIONS+OWEN, A+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1990::EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD RATIO CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR A SINGLE FUNCTIONAL+OWEN, AB+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1988::Confidence intervals for marginal parameters under fractional linear regression imputation for missing data+Qin, Yongsong; Rao, J.

This result motivated the research in Gao and Zhou (J Stat Plan Inference 149:140-151, 2014), where A-optimal and D-optimal design criteria based on the SLSE were proposed and various design properties were studied. In this paper, we continue to investigate the optimal designs based on the SLSE and derive new results for the D-optimal designs. Using convex optimization techniques and moment theories, we can construct D-optimal designs for univariate polynomial and trigonometric regression models on any closed interval. Several theoretical results are obtained. The methodology is quite general. It can be applied to reduced polynomial models, reduced trigonometric models, and other regression models. It can also be extended to A-optimal designs based on the SLSE.","Asymmetric distribution,Convex optimization,Moment theory,Optimal design,Polynomial regression,Trigonometric regression","TRIGONOMETRIC REGRESSION-MODELS,PROGRAMMING BASED ALGORITHM,PARTIAL CIRCLE","Gao, Lucy L.@Univ Victoria, Dept Math & Stat, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada::Zhou, Julie@Univ Victoria, Dept Math & Stat, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada","Gao, Lucy L.@University of Victoria::Zhou, Julie@University of Victoria",not exist,"no title+Berger, M.

A comparison of different synchronized permutation approaches to testing effects in two-level two-factor unbalanced ANOVA designs,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0690-2,MAR 2017,20,1,Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to compare the means of various samples. Parametric ANOVA approaches assume normally distributed error terms within subsamples. Permutation tests like synchronized permutation tests are computationally intensive and distribution free procedures. Hence they overcome the limitations of parametric methods. Unbalanced designs with differing subsample sizes are quite frequent in various disciplines. There is a broad literature about unbalanced designs and parametric testing. For permutation tests this topic received some attention recently. This paper extends the synchronized permutation method to unbalanced two-level ANOVA designs.

Principal component selection via adaptive regularization method and generalized information criterion,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0691-1,MAR 2017,17,1,"The principal component analysis has been widely used in various fields of research (e.g., bioinformatics, medical statistics, etc.), especially high dimensional data analysis. Although crucial components selection is a vital matter in principal components analysis, relatively little attention was paid to this issue. The existing studies for principal component analysis were based on ad-hoc methods (e.g., method with cumulative percent variance or average eigenvalue). We propose a novel method for selecting principal component based on L-type regularized regression modeling. In order to effectively perform for principal component regression, we consider adaptive L-type penalty based on singular values of components, and propose adaptive penalized principal component regression. The proposed method can perform feature selection incorporating explanation power of components for not only high-dimensional predictor variables but also response variable. In sparse regression modeling, choosing the regularization parameter is a crucial issue, since feature selection and estimation heavily depend on the selected regularization parameter. We derive a model selection criterion for choosing the regularization parameter of the proposed adaptive L-type regularization method in line with a generalized information criterion. Monte Carlo simulations and real data analysis demonstrate that the proposed modeling strategies outperform for principal component regression modeling.","Adaptive L-1-type penalty,Information criterion,Principal component analysis,Sparse regression modeling","VARIABLE SELECTION,ORACLE PROPERTIES,LASSO,MODEL,LIKELIHOOD","Park, Heewon@Yamaguchi Univ, Fac Global & Sci Studies, 677-1 Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi 753811, Japan::Konishi, Sadanori@Chuo Univ, Dept Math, Fac Sci & Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 1-13-27 Kasuga, Tokyo 1128551, Japan","Park, Heewon@Yamaguchi University::Konishi, Sadanori@Chuo University",not exist,"Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::SPARSE LEAST TRIMMED SQUARES REGRESSION FOR ANALYZING HIGH-DIMENSIONAL LARGE DATA SETS+Alfons, Andreas; Croux, Christophe; Gelper, Sarah+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2013::Combining two-parameter and principal component regression estimators+Chang, Xinfeng; Yang, Hu+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2012::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Variable selection via the weighted group lasso for factor analysis models+Hirose, Kei; Konishi, Sadanori+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 2012::Generalised information criteria in model selection+Konishi, S; Kitagawa, G+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1996::Ultrahigh dimensional variable selection through the penalized maximum trimmed likelihood estimator+Neykov, N.

On the determination of the number of factors using information criteria with data-driven penalty,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0692-0,MAR 2017,17,0,"As is well known, when using an information criterion to select the number of common factors in factor models the appropriate penalty is generally indetermine in the sense that it can be scaled by an arbitrary constant, c say, without affecting consistency. In an influential paper, Hallin and Lika (J Am Stat Assoc 102:603-617, 2007) proposes a data-driven procedure for selecting the appropriate value of c. However, by removing one source of indeterminacy, the new procedure simultaneously creates several new ones, which make for rather complicated implementation, a problem that has been largely overlooked in the literature. By providing an extensive analysis using both simulated and real data, the current paper fills this gap.","Panel data,Common factor model,Information criterion,Data-driven penalty","APPROXIMATE FACTOR MODELS,DYNAMIC FACTORS,PANEL","Westerlund, Joakim@Deakin Univ, Financial Econometr Grp, Ctr Res Econ & Financial Econometr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia@Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden::Mishra, Sagarika@Deakin Univ, Financial Econometr Grp, Ctr Res Econ & Financial Econometr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Westerlund, Joakim@Lund University@Deakin University::Mishra, Sagarika@Deakin University",not exist,"Eigenvalue Ratio Test for the Number of Factors+Ahn, Seung C.; Horenstein, Alex R.+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 2013::Improved penalization for determining the number of factors in approximate factor models+Alessi, Lucia; Barigozzi, Matteo; Capasso, Marco+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+DEC 1 2010::Consistent estimation of the number of dynamic factors in a large N and T panel+Amengual, Dante; Watson, Mark W.+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2007::Inferential theory for factor models of large dimensions.+Bai, J+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2003::Determining the number of factors in approximate factor models+Bai, JS; Ng, S+ECONOMETRICA+JAN 2002::Testing for cross-sectional dependence in a panel factor model using the wild bootstrap test+Baltagi, Badi H.; Kao, Chihwa; Na, Sanggon+STATISTICAL PAPERS+NOV 2013::The great moderation+Bernanke, B.+E EC ASS M WASH+2004::Testing for structural breaks in dynamic factor models+Breitung, Joerg; Eickmeier, Sandra+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 2011::A Canonical Correlation Approach for Selecting the Number of Dynamic Factors+Breitung, Joerg; Pigorsch, Uta+OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 2013::Determining the number of factors in the general dynamic factor model+Hallin, Marc; Liska, Roman+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2007::Factor analysis regression+Kosfeld, Reinhold; Lauridsen, Jorgen+STATISTICAL PAPERS+OCT 2008::UNIT-ROOT TESTS IN ARMA MODELS WITH DATA-DEPENDENT METHODS FOR THE SELECTION OF THE TRUNCATION LAG+NG, S; PERRON, P+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1995::TESTING HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FACTORS IN LARGE FACTOR MODELS+Onatski, Alexei+ECONOMETRICA+SEP 2009::DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF FACTORS FROM EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF EIGENVALUES+Onatski, Alexei+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+NOV 2010::Estimation and inference in large heterogeneous panels with a multifactor error structure+Pesaran, M.

Kernel regression estimation for incomplete data with applications,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0693-z,MAR 2017,40,0,"Methods are proposed to construct kernel estimators of a regression function in the presence of incomplete data. Furthermore, exponential upper bounds are derived on the performance of the norms of the proposed estimators, which can then be used to establish various strong convergence results. The presence of incomplete data points are handled by a Horvitz-Thompson-type inverse weighting approach, where the unknown selection probabilities are estimated by both kernel regression and least-squares methods. As an immediate application of these results, the problem of nonparametric classification with partially observed data will be studied.","Regular kernels,Incomplete data,Convergence,Regression,Classification","MISSING DATA,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,ESTIMATING EQUATIONS,L1 CONVERGENCE,MODELS,OUTCOMES,CONSISTENCY,LIKELIHOOD,VARIABLES,RESPONSES","Mojirsheibani, Majid@Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Math, Northridge, CA 91330 USA::Reese, Timothy@Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Math, Northridge, CA 91330 USA","Mojirsheibani, Majid@California State University System@California State University Northridge::Reese, Timothy@California State University System@California State University Northridge",not exist,"no title+Bernstein, S.+The Theory of Probabilities+1946::Local quasi-likelihood estimation with data missing at random+Chen, Jianwei; Fan, Jianqing; Li, Kim-Hung; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2006::Estimation of distribution functions and quantiless with missing data+Cheng, PE; Chu, CK+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 1996::NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION ESTIMATION WITH MISSING DATA+CHU, CK; CHENG, PE+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 1 1995::no title+Devroye, L.; Gyorfi, L.; Lugosi, G.+A Probabilistic Theory of Pattern Recognition+1996::ON THE ALMOST EVERYWHERE CONVERGENCE OF NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION FUNCTION ESTIMATES+DEVROYE, L+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::AN EQUIVALENCE THEOREM FOR L1 CONVERGENCE OF THE KERNEL REGRESSION ESTIMATE+DEVROYE, L; KRZYZAK, A+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1989::no title+Devroye, L.; Gyorfi, L.+Nonparametric Density Estimation: The L1 View+1985::ON THE L1 CONVERGENCE OF KERNEL ESTIMATORS OF REGRESSION-FUNCTIONS WITH APPLICATIONS IN DISCRIMINATION+DEVROYE, LP; WAGNER, TJ+ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WAHRSCHEINLICHKEITSTHEORIE UND VERWANDTE GEBIETE+1980::Nonparametric regression with responses missing at random+Efromovich, Sam+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+DEC 2011::An improved estimator to analyse missing data+Gonzalez, S.; Rueda, M.; Arcos, A.+STATISTICAL PAPERS+OCT 2008::Efficient estimation of average treatment effects using the estimated propensity score+Hirano, K; Imbens, GW; Ridder, G+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 2003::PROBABILITY-INEQUALITIES FOR SUMS OF BOUNDED RANDOM-VARIABLES+HOEFFDING, W+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1963::A GENERALIZATION OF SAMPLING WITHOUT REPLACEMENT FROM A FINITE UNIVERSE+HORVITZ, DG; THOMPSON, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1952::Pseudolikelihood ratio test with biased observations+Hu, X.

Likewise, this paper is first in utilizing the kernel PLS in handling and classifying missing data. By experimentally comparing the results of different classification methods including missing data handling on three opened biomedical datasets (Arrhythmia, Mammographic Mass, and Pima Indians Diabetes at UCI Machine Learning Repository,), we found that the proposed kernel PLS plus kernel PLSDA yielded better accuracies than the existing methods.","Kernel partial least squares,Discriminant analysis,PLS,Missing data,Classification","PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES,VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFIERS,ALGORITHM,PREDICTION","Thuy Tuong Nguyen@Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA::Tsoy, Yury@Inst Pasteur Korea, Seongnam Si, South Korea","Thuy Tuong Nguyen@University of California System@University of California Davis::Tsoy, Yury@Unknow",not exist,"The treatment of missing values and its effect in the classifier accuracy+Acuna, E; Rodriguez, C.+P M INT FED CLASS SO+2004::IMPROVED STRAIGHTFORWARD IMPLEMENTATION OF A STATISTICALLY INSPIRED MODIFICATION OF THE PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES ALGORITHM+Alin, Aylin; Ali, M.

Robust functional sliced inverse regression,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0695-x,MAR 2017,47,3,"Functional data are infinite-dimensional statistical objects which pose significant challenges to both theorists and practitioners. To avoid the stringent constraints for parametric methods and low convergence rate for nonparametric methods, many functional dimension reduction methods have received attention in the functional data analysis literature, which, if desired, can be combined with low dimensional nonparametric regression in a later step. However, as far as we know that all of the functional dimension reduction methods are based on the classical estimates of the first and second moments of the data, and therefore sensitive to outliers. In the present paper, we propose a robust functional dimension reduction method by replacing the classical estimates with robust ones in the functional sliced inverse regression (FSIR). This leads to procedures which maintain the clever estimation scheme of the original FSIR method but can cope better with outliers. A comparison with FSIR is also made through simulation studies to show the robustness of the robust functional sliced inverse regression (RFSIR). As applications, the Orange juice data and the Tecator data are analyzed by using the proposed RFSIR method.","Dimension reduction,Functional regression,Functional sliced inverse regression,Robustness","SUFFICIENT DIMENSION REDUCTION,CANONICAL CORRELATION,LINEAR-REGRESSION,PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS,MODEL,ESTIMATORS","Wang, Guochang@Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China::Zhou, Jianjun@Yunnan Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China::Wu, Wuqing@Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China::Chen, Min@Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Wang, Guochang@Jinan University::Zhou, Jianjun@Yunnan University::Wu, Wuqing@Renmin University of China::Chen, Min@Chinese Academy of Sciences@Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS",not exist,"Dimension reduction in functional regression with applications+Amato, U; Antoniadis, A; De Feis, I+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+MAY 1 2006::Variable selection in infinite-dimensional problems+Aneiros, German; Vieu, Philippe+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+NOV 2014::Semi-functional partial linear regression+Aneiros-Perez, German; Vieu, Philippe+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 1 2006::no title+Bongiorno, EG; Salinelli, E; Goia, A<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Vieu, P</span>.+Contributions in infinite-dimensional statistics and related topics+2014::Prediction in functional linear regression+Cai, T.

Linear censored regression models with scale mixtures of normal distributions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0696-9,MAR 2017,32,7,"In the framework of censored regression models the random errors are routinely assumed to have a normal distribution, mainly for mathematical convenience. However, this method has been criticized in the literature because of its sensitivity to deviations from the normality assumption. Here, we first establish a new link between the censored regression model and a recently studied class of symmetric distributions, which extend the normal one by the inclusion of kurtosis, called scale mixtures of normal (SMN) distributions. The Student-t, Pearson type VII, slash, contaminated normal, among others distributions, are contained in this class. A member of this class can be a good alternative to model this kind of data, because they have been shown its flexibility in several applications. In this work, we develop an analytically simple and efficient EM-type algorithm for iteratively computing maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters, with standard errors as a by-product. The algorithm has closed-form expressions at the E-step, that rely on formulas for the mean and variance of certain truncated SMN distributions. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the R package SMNCensReg. Applications with simulated and a real data set are reported, illustrating the usefulness of the new methodology.","Censored regression model,EM-type,Algorithms,Scale mixtures of normal distributions,Outliers","EM ALGORITHM,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,T-DISTRIBUTION,INFERENCE","Garay, Aldo M.@Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Estat, Rua Sergio Buarque de Holanda 651, BR-13083859 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil::Lachos, Victor H.@Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Estat, Rua Sergio Buarque de Holanda 651, BR-13083859 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil::Bolfarine, Heleno@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Matemat & Estat, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil::Cabral, Celso R.

Optimal designs for model discrimination and fitting for the flow of particles,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0792-5,DEC 2016,12,0,"During the discharge of a two-dimensional silo, the flow of grains through an opening is arrested if the size of the outlet is not large enough. In the outpouring of grains, jamming occurs due to the formation of an arch at the outlet. After breaking the arch, the grains fall until a new arch is formed. Several models have been proposed to explain this process. The goal of this work is twofold. First, we developed a comparative study of the models proposed by Janda et al. (Europhys Lett 84(4):44002-1-44002-6, 2008) and To (Phys Rev E 71(6):060301-1-060301-4, 2005). We have computed D-optimal and c-optimal designs for the most important parameter of the models. Secondly, using the criterion of KL-optimality developed by Lpez-Fidalgo et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser B 69(2):231-242, 2007), optimal designs for discriminating between these models have been computed.","D-optimality,KL-optimality,c-Optimality,Granular material",,"Amo-Salas, Mariano@Sch Med, Camino Moledores S-N, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain::Delgado-Marquez, Elvira@Higher Tech Sch Ind Engn, Ave Camilo Jose Cela 1, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain::Filova, Lenka@Fac Math Phys & Informat, Bratislava 84248, Slovakia::Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@Higher Tech Sch Ind Engn, Ave Camilo Jose Cela 1, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain","Amo-Salas, Mariano@Unknow::Delgado-Marquez, Elvira@Unknow::Filova, Lenka@Comenius University Bratislava::Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@Unknow","Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@A-2412-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7502-8188","Optimal Experimental Designs in the Flow Rate of Particles+Amo-Salas, Mariano; Delgado-Marquez, Elvira; Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 2016::no title+Atkinson, A.; Donev, A.; Tobias, R.+Optimum Experimental Designs, with SAS+2007::OPTIMAL DESIGN - EXPERIMENTS FOR DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN SEVERAL MODELS+ATKINSON, AC; FEDOROV, VV+BIOMETRIKA+1975::PLANNING EXPERIMENTS FOR DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN MODELS+ATKINSON, AC; COX, DR+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::no title+Fedorov, V.; Hackl, P.+Model-Oriented Design of Experiments+1997::no title+Fedorov, V.V.+Theory of Optimal Experiments+1972::Jamming and critical outlet size in the discharge of a two-dimensional silo+Janda, A; Zuriguel, I; Garcimartin, A<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Pugnaloni, LA; Maza, D</span>.+Europhys Lett+2008::An optimal experimental design criterion for discriminating between non-normal models+Lopez-Fidalgo, J.; Tommasi, C.; Trandafir, P.

Optimal design of experiments via linear programming,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0782-7,DEC 2016,21,1,"We investigate the possibility of extending some results of Pazman and Pronzato (Ann Stat 42(4):1426-1451, 2014) to a larger set of optimality criteria. Namely, the problems of computing D-, A-, and -optimal designs in a linear regression model are reformulated here as ""infinite-dimensional"" linear programming problems. The same approach is applied to combination of these optimality criteria and to the ""criterion robust"" problem of Harman (Metrika 60:137-153, 2004). Approximate optimum designs can then be computed by a relaxation method (Shimizu and Aiyoshi in IEEE Trans Autom Control 25(1):62-66, 1980), and this is illustrated on various examples.","Regression models,Optimality criteria,Concave maximization,Relaxation method,Criterion-robust design","REGRESSION,ALGORITHMS,CRITERION,MODEL","Burclova, Katarina@Comenius Univ, Fac Math Phys & Informat, Bratislava 84248, Slovakia::Pazman, Andrej@Comenius Univ, Fac Math Phys & Informat, Bratislava 84248, Slovakia","Burclova, Katarina@Comenius University Bratislava::Pazman, Andrej@Comenius University Bratislava",not exist,"OPTIMUM EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS FOR PROPERTIES OF A COMPARTMENTAL MODEL+ATKINSON, AC; CHALONER, K; HERZBERG, AM; et al.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1993::no title+Bonnans, J.F.; Gilbert, J.C.; Lemarechal, C.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Sagastizabal, C.A</span>.+Numerical Optimization: Theoretical and Practical Aspects+2006::Criterion-Robust Experimental Designs for the Quadratic Regression on a Square and a Cube+Filova, Lenka; Harman, Radoslav+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+JUN 1 2013::Computing maximin efficient experimental designs using the methods of semidefinite programming+Filova, Lenka; Trnovska, Maria; Harman, Radoslav+METRIKA+JUL 2012::FURTHER CHARACTERIZATIONS OF DESIGN-OPTIMALITY AND ADMISSIBILITY FOR PARTIAL PARAMETER-ESTIMATION IN LINEAR-REGRESSION+GAFFKE, N+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1987::EQUIVALENCE THEOREMS AND CUTTING PLANE ALGORITHMS FOR A CLASS OF EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN PROBLEMS+GRIBIK, PR; KORTANEK, KO+SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS+1977::Minimal efficiency of designs under the class of orthogonally invariant information criteria+Harman, R+METRIKA+2004::Computing c-optimal experimental designs using the simplex method of linear programming+Harman, Radoslav; Jurik, Tomas+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 15 2008::no title+Harville, D.

Liu estimation in generalized linear models: application on gamma distributed response variable,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0814-3,DEC 2016,14,1,"Multicollinearity among the explanatory variables seriously effects the maximum likelihood estimator in linear regression models which results in too large estimates in absolute value and in large variance-covariance matrix. The adverse effects of multicollinearity on parameter estimation in generalized linear models are also explored by various authors in the case of maximum likelihood estimation. In this study, we introduce a first-order approximated Liu estimator to combat multicollinearity in generalized linear models which is an extension of the Liu estimator in the linear regression model. We also obtain necessary and sufficient condition for the superiority of the first-order approximated Liu estimator over the the first-order approximated maximum likelihood estimator by the approximated mean squared error criterion. Biasing parameter estimator of the first-order approximated Liu estimator is proposed by minimizing the approximated mean squared error. The results are illustrated by conducting a numerical example and simulation study.","Liu estimator,Generalized linear model,Multicollinearity,Mean squared error",RIDGE-REGRESSION,"Kurtoglu, Fikriye@Cukurova Univ, Fac Sci & Letters, Dept Stat, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey::Ozkale, M.

Regularization techniques in joinpoint regression,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0823-2,DEC 2016,26,1,"Joinpoint regression models are popular in various situations (modeling different trends in economics, mortality and incidence series or epidemiology studies and clinical trials). The literature on joinpoint regression mostly focuses on either the frequentist point of view, or discusses Bayesian approaches instead. A model selection step in all these scenarios considers only some limited set of alternatives, from which the final model is chosen. We present a different model estimation approach: the final model is selected out of all possible alternatives admitted by the data.

Their asymptotic properties are derived. Two families of exponentiality tests from this class, based on two selected characterizations, are presented. The approximate Bahadur efficiency is used to assess their quality.

Iterative algorithms of biased estimation methods in binary logistic regression,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0780-9,DEC 2016,25,1,"Logistic regression is a widely used method to model categorical response data, and maximum likelihood (ML) estimation has widespread use in logistic regression. Although ML method is the most used method to estimate the regression coefficients in logistic regression model, multicollinearity seriously affects the ML estimator. To remedy the undesirable effects of multicollinearity, estimators alternative to ML are proposed. Drawing on the similarities between the multiple linear and logistic regressions, ridge, Liu and two parameter estimators are proposed which are based on the ML estimator. On the other hand, first-order approximated ridge estimator is proposed for use in logistic regression. This study will present further solutions to the problem in the form of alternative estimators which reduce the effect of collinearity. Owing to this, first-order approximated Liu, iterative Liu and iterative two parameter estimators are proposed. A simulation study as well as real life application are carried out to ascertain the effect of sample size and degree of multicollinearity, in which the ML based, first-order approximated and iterative biased estimators are compared. Graphical representations are presented which support the effect of the shrinkage parameter on the mean square error and prediction mean square error of the biased estimators.","Iteratively reweighted least squares,Binary logistic regression,Ridge estimator,Liu estimator,Mean square error","RIDGE-REGRESSION,LINEAR-REGRESSION,PERFORMANCE,PARAMETERS","Ozkale, M.

Projective shape analysis of contours and finite 3D configurations from digital camera images,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0824-1,DEC 2016,18,0,"We analyze infinite dimensional projective shape data collected from digital camera images, focusing on two-sample hypothesis testing for both finite and infinite extrinsic mean configurations. The two sample test methodology is based on a Lie group technique that was derived by Crane and Patrangenaru (J Multivar Anal 102:225-237, 2011) and Qiu et al. (Neighborhood hypothesis testing for mean change on infinite dimensional Lie groups and 3D projective shape analysis of matched contours, 2015). In infinite dimensions, the equality of two extrinsic means is likely to be rejected, thus a neighborhood hypothesis is suitably tested, combining the ideas in these two papers with data analysis methods on Hilbert manifolds in Ellingson et al. (J Multivar Anal 122:317-333, 2013). In this manuscript, we apply these general results to the two sample problem for independent projective shapes of 3D facial configurations and for matched projective shapes of 2D and 3D contours. Digital images of 3D scenes are today at the fingertips of any statistician. Here and in the literature referenced in the in this paper, we provide a methodology for properly analyzing such data, when more pictures of a given scene are available.",,"BOOTSTRAP METHODS,SAMPLE","Patrangenaru, Victor@Florida State Univ, Dept Stat, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA::Paige, Robert@Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math & Stat, Rolla, MO USA::Yao, K.

Unitarily invariant errors-in-variables estimation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0800-9,DEC 2016,18,1,"Linear relations, containing measurement errors in the input and output data, are considered. Parameters of these errors-in-variables (EIV) models can be estimated by minimizing the total least squares (TLS) of the input-output disturbances, i.e., penalizing the orthogonal squared misfit. This approach corresponds to minimizing the Frobenius norm of the error matrix. An extension of the traditional TLS estimator in the EIV model-the EIV estimator-is proposed in the way that a general unitarily invariant norm of the error matrix is minimized. Such an estimator is highly non-linear. Regardless of the chosen unitarily invariant matrix norm, the corresponding EIV estimator is shown to coincide with the TLS estimator.

Optimal approximate designs for estimating treatment contrasts resistant to nuisance effects,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0809-0,DEC 2016,32,0,"Suppose that we intend to perform an experiment consisting of a set of independent trials. The mean value of the response in each trial is assumed to be equal to the sum of the effect of the treatment selected for that trial and some nuisance effects, e.g., the effect of a time trend or blocking. In this model, we examine optimal approximate designs for the estimation of a system of treatment contrasts, with respect to a wide range of optimality criteria. We show that it is necessary for any optimal design to attain the optimal treatment proportions, which may be obtained from the marginal model that excludes the nuisance effects. Moreover, we prove that for a design to be optimal, it is sufficient that it attains the optimal treatment proportions and satisfies the conditions for resistance to nuisance effects. For selected natural choices of treatment contrasts and optimality criteria, we calculate the optimal treatment proportions and provide an explicit form of optimal designs. In particular, we obtain optimal treatment proportions for the comparison of a set of test treatments with a set of controls. Once the optimal treatment proportions are determined, the results allow us to construct a method of calculating optimal approximate designs with small support sizes through linear programming. Consequently, we can construct efficient exact designs using a simple heuristic.","Approximate design,Optimal design,Treatment contrasts,Resistance to nuisance effects,Designs with small support","INCOMPLETE BLOCK-DESIGNS,COMPARING TREATMENTS,TREND,CONSTRUCTION,SET,INFORMATION","Rosa, Samuel@Comenius Univ, Fac Math Phys & Informat, Bratislava, Slovakia::Harman, Radoslav@Comenius Univ, Fac Math Phys & Informat, Bratislava, Slovakia","Rosa, Samuel@Comenius University Bratislava::Harman, Radoslav@Comenius University Bratislava",not exist,"Optimum biased-coin designs for sequential treatment allocation with covariate information+Atkinson, AC+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 30 1999::Experimental designs optimally balanced for trend+Atkinson, AC; Donev, AN+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1996::CONSTRUCTION OF TREND-RESISTANT FACTORIAL-DESIGNS+BAILEY, RA; CHENG, CS; KIPNIS, P+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 1992::Combinatorics of optimal designs+Bailey, RA; Cameron, PJ.+Surv Comb+2009::INCOMPLETE BLOCK-DESIGNS FOR COMPARING TREATMENTS WITH A CONTROL - GENERAL-THEORY+BECHHOFER, RE; TAMHANE, AC+TECHNOMETRICS+1981::TREND-FREE BLOCK-DESIGNS - THEORY+BRADLEY, RA; YEH, CM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1980::no title+Cheng, CS.+Construction of run orders of factorial designs.

A Bayesian approach for the estimation of probability distributions under finite sample space,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0669-z,SEP 2016,21,1,"In this article, we describe a Bayesian approach for the estimation of probability distribution of a discrete random variable (rv) with correlated classes under finite sample space. We utilize general benefits of Bayesian approaches within the context of estimation of probability distributions under finite sample space. In our approach, a tractable posterior distribution is obtained; and hence, posterior inferences are easily drawn by using the Gibbs sampling. Possible prior correlations between adjacent categories of the considered discrete rv are suitably modeled. The proposed approach takes into account all available information contained in successive samples as a natural consequence of using Bayes's theorem. It is beneficial in the estimation of probability distributions for compositional data sets observed in longitudinal studies. We analyze two bar charts from two health surveys in Italy for illustrative purposes and apply our approach to a data set from general elections of Turkey.","Bar chart,Compositional data,Dirichlet process prior,Elections,Polya trees,Truncated log normal distribution","LOG-LINEAR MODELS,DENSITY-ESTIMATION","Demirhan, Haydar@Hacettepe Univ, Dept Stat, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey::Demirhan, Kamil@Hacettepe Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey","Demirhan, Haydar@Hacettepe University::Demirhan, Kamil@Hacettepe University","Demirhan, Haydar@A-9966-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8565-4710","Estimation, prediction and interpretation of NGG random effects models: an application to Kevlar fibre failure times+Argiento, Raffaele; Guglielmi, Alessandra; Pievatolo, Antonio+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2014::no title+Box, G.E.P.; Tiao, G.C.+Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis+1973::Bayesian non-parametric models for regional prevalence estimation+Branscum, Adam J.; Hanson, Timothy E.; Gardner, Ian A.+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+2008::no title+Christensen, R; Johnson, W; Branscum, A<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Hanson, T</span>.+Bayesian ideas and data analysis: an introduction for scientists and statisticians+2010::Health observation compared to health reporting: Findings from a pilot study in Florence+Conti, Susanna; Farchi, Gino; Minelli, Giada; et al.+ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY+DEC 2007::A Bayesian approach to the estimation of expected cell counts by using log-linear models+Demirhan, H; Hamurkaroglu, C+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2006::Bayesian estimation of order-restricted and unrestricted association models+Demirhan, Haydar+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 2013::Bayesian estimation of log odds ratios from R x C and 2 x 2 x K contingency tables+Demirhan, Haydar; Hamurkaroglu, Canan+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+NOV 2008::Filtered-variate prior distributions for histogram smoothing+Dickey, JM; Jiang, TJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1998::Inference and monitoring convergence+Gelman, A.+Markov chain Monte Carlo in practice+1996::Surviving fully Bayesian nonparametricregression models+Hanson, TE; Jara, A.+Bayesian theory and applications+2013::National health interview surveys in Europe: an overview+Hupkens, CLH; van den Berg, J; van der Zee, J+HEALTH POLICY+MAY 1999::no title+Kaynar, M.+Political parties of Republic period of 1923-2006+2007::Prior induction in log-linear models for general contingency table analysis+King, R; Brooks, SP+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2001::BAYESIAN METHOD FOR HISTOGRAMS+LEONARD, T+BIOMETRIKA+1973::DENSITY ESTIMATION, STOCHASTIC-PROCESSES AND PRIOR INFORMATION+LEONARD, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1978::Bayesian nonparametric inference for unimodal skew-symmetric distributions+Mostofi, A.

Estimation after selection from exponential populations with unequal scale parameters,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0670-6,SEP 2016,33,3,"Consider (2) exponential populations having unknown guarantee times and known (possibly unequal) failure rates. For selecting the unknown population having the largest guarantee time, with samples of (possibly) unequal sizes from the populations, we consider a class of selection rules based on natural estimators of the guarantee times. We deal with the problem of estimating the guarantee time of the population selected, using a fixed selection rule from this class, under the squared error loss function. The uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) is derived.

We provide a comprehensive description of the properties of the proposed distribution along with a study of its hazard function. Closed expressions for several probabilistic measures are provided, such as probability density function, function hazard, moments, quantile function, mean, variance and median. Inference is maximum likelihood based. Simulation studies are performed in order to evaluate the asymptotic properties of the parameter estimates.

A new method to build spatio-temporal covariance functions: analysis of ozone data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0674-2,SEP 2016,41,2,"Statistical analysis of natural phenomena with spatial and temporal correlations requires the specification of the correlation structure via a covariance function. A separable spatio-temporal covariance function is usually used for the ease of application. Nonetheless, the separability of the spatio-temporal covariance function can be unrealistic in many settings, where it is required to use a non-separable spatio-temporal covariance function. In this paper, the role of Stieltjes transformation in the construction of non-separable spatio-temporal covariance function is investigated. Then, structural copula function is applied to construct a family of non-separable spatio-temporal covariance function. Afterwards, it is proved that this family of covariance functions does not possess any dimple which exists in some Gneiting's models. Finally, a modified genetic algorithm is applied to explore the spatio-temporal correlation structure of Ozone data in Tehran, Iran.","Copula function,Spatio-temporal covariance,Genetic algorithm","SPACE-TIME DATA,MODELS,VARIOGRAMS,FAMILIES","Omidi, Mehdi@Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Stat, Tehran, Iran::Mohammadzadeh, Mohsen@Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Stat, Tehran, Iran","Omidi, Mehdi@Tarbiat Modares University::Mohammadzadeh, Mohsen@Tarbiat Modares University",not exist,"Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike+1998::no title+Auffarth, B.+Clustering by a genetic algorithm with biased mutation operator+2010::Genetic algorithm: an approach to solve global optimisation problems+Bajpai, P; Kumar, M.+Indian J Comput Sci Eng+2008::Stieltjes-Pick-Bernstein-Schoenberg and their connection to complete monotonicity+Berg, C.+Positive Definite Functions.

The principal correlation components estimator and its optimality,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0678-y,SEP 2016,32,0,"In regression analysis, the principal components regression estimator (PCRE) is often used to alleviate the effect of multicollinearity by deleting the principal components variables with smaller eigenvalues, but it has some drawbacks for subset selection. So another effective estimator based on the principal components, termed the principal correlation components estimator (PCCE), has been proposed, which selects the variables by considering the correlation coefficients between the principal components variables and the response variable. In this paper we investigate the property of the PCCE and its optimality. We prove that the PCCE is an admissible estimator and obtain the condition that the PCCE performs better than the PCRE under the balanced loss function (BLF). As an improvement of the least squares estimator (LSE), the conditions that the PCCE performs better than LSE under the BLF and the Pitman closeness criterion are derived in the paper. The empirical performance of the PCCE is demonstrated by several real and simulation data examples.","Principal correlation components estimator,Least squares estimator,Principal components regression estimator,Admissible estimator,Balanced loss function,Pitman closeness criterion","BIASED-ESTIMATION,RIDGE-REGRESSION,LEAST-SQUARES,BALANCED LOSS,COLLINEARITY,PREDICTION,PARAMETERS,MODELS,CEMENT","Guo, Wenxing@Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Math & Stat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China::Liu, Xiaohui@Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China::Zhang, Shangli@Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Sci, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China","Guo, Wenxing@Central University of Finance & Economics::Liu, Xiaohui@Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics::Zhang, Shangli@Beijing Jiaotong University",not exist,"Generalized Liu type estimators under Zellner's balanced loss function+Akdeniz, F; Wan, ATK; Akdeniz, E+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2005::United States Metropolitan Mortality, 1959-1961+Duffy, EA; Carroll, RE.+PHS PUBLICATION+1967::OPTIMAL PROPERTY OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS IN CONTEXT OF RESTRICTED LEAST-SQUARES+FOMBY, TB; HILL, RC; JOHNSON, SR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1978::A STATISTICAL VIEW OF SOME CHEMOMETRICS REGRESSION TOOLS+FRANK, IE; FRIEDMAN, JH+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1993::Some cautionary notes on the use of principal components regression+Hadi, AS; Ling, RF+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+FEB 1998::DIAGNOSING COLLINEARITY-INFLUENTIAL OBSERVATIONS+HADI, AS+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 1988::no title+Hald, A.+Statistical Theory with Engineering Applications+1952::IMPROVED PREDICTION IN THE PRESENCE OF MULTICOLLINEARITY+HILL, RC; JUDGE, G+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAY 1987::RIDGE REGRESSION - BIASED ESTIMATION FOR NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS+HOERL, AE; KENNARD, RW+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::Principal components regression with data-chosen components and related methods+Hwang, JTG; Nettleton, D+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2003::RELATIONSHIPS AMONG COEFFICIENTS OF VECTORS USED IN PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS+JACKSON, JE; HEARNE, FT+TECHNOMETRICS+1973::A NOTE ON THE USE OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS IN REGRESSION+JOLLIFFE, IT+APPLIED STATISTICS-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C+1982::no title+JUDGE, Gerge G.; GRIFFITHS, William E.; HILL, R.

Partially linear models with first-order autoregressive symmetric errors,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0680-4,SEP 2016,26,1,"In this paper we discuss estimation and diagnostic procedures for partially linear models with first-order autoregressive [AR(1)] symmetric errors. The symmetric class includes all symmetric continuous distributions, particularly distributions with heavier and lighter tails than the normal ones, such as Student-t, power exponential and logistic, among others. Estimation is performed by maximum penalized likelihood and by using natural cubic splines. We derive the penalized score functions and the penalized Fisher information matrices for the parameters in the model. A reweighted iterative process based on the back-fitting algorithm is derived for the parameter estimation and the inference is based on the penalized Fisher information matrix. We discuss the effective degrees of freedom estimation and procedures for selecting the smoothing parameter. A small simulation study is performed for assessing the empirical distribution of the parameter estimates obtained from partially linear models with AR(1) errors. Residual analysis and derivation of conformal normal curvatures of local influence for some perturbation schemes are also given.

Statistical inference for a step-stress partially-accelerated life test model with an adaptive Type-I progressively hybrid censored data from Weibull distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0639-x,APR 2016,29,1,"In this paper, a new censoring scheme, namely, adaptive Type-I progressively hybrid censoring scheme under a step-stress partially accelerated test model is introduced. It has some advantages over the progressively hybrid censoring schemes already discussed in the literature. Based on this censoring scheme, the maximum likelihood estimations of Weibull distribution parameters and the acceleration factor are considered. The biases and mean squared errors of the maximum likelihood estimators of the model parameters are computed to evaluate their performances in the presence of censoring scheme developed in this paper through a Monte Carlo simulation study.

Yet, the existing asymptotic analysis of this test statistic is limited to a model in which the errors are assumed to follow a simple AR(1) structure with homogenous autoregressive coefficients. One reason for this is that the model involves an intricate identification issue, as both the serial and cross-section correlation structures of the errors are unobserved. The purpose of the current paper is to tackle this issue and in so doing extend the existing analysis to the case of AR() errors with possibly heterogeneous coefficients.","Unit root test,Error serial correlation,Common factor,Cross-section augmentation",,"Westerlund, Joakim@Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden@Deakin Univ, Financial Econometr Grp, Ctr Res Econ & Financial Econometr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Westerlund, Joakim@Lund University@Deakin University",not exist,"Large Dimensional Factor Analysis+Bai, J.; Ng, S.+Foundations and Trends in Econometrics+2008::Econometric Analysis of Panel Data+Baltagi, B.+ECONOMETRIC ANAL PAN+2008::PANEL UNIT ROOT TESTS IN THE PRESENCE OF CROSS-SECTIONAL DEPENDENCIES: COMPARISON AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MODELLING+Gengenbach, Christian; Palm, Franz C.; Urbain, Jean-Pierre+ECONOMETRIC REVIEWS+2010::Testing for unit roots in heterogeneous panels+Im, KS; Pesaran, MH; Shin, Y+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JUL 2003::Unit Roots and Cointegration in Panels+Pesaran, M.

A moment closed form estimator for the autoregressive conditional duration model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0652-0,APR 2016,12,1,A moment closed form estimator for the autoregressive conditional duration model is proposed in this paper. The estimator has the advantage over the often used quasi-maximum likelihood estimator in which it can be easily obtained and does not require the use of any numerical optimization and iterative procedure or the choice of initial value of the conditional mean process. We find that the estimator is consistent and weakly converged when the second moment of the duration exits. The estimator is shown to be -asymptotically normally distributed when the fourth moment exits.

On two simple and effective procedures for high dimensional classification of general populations,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0660-8,APR 2016,20,0,"In this paper, we generalize two criteria, the determinant-based and trace-based criteria proposed by Saranadasa (J Multivar Anal 46:154-174, 1993), to general populations for high dimensional classification. These two criteria compare some distances between a new observation and several different known groups. The determinant-based criterion performs well for correlated variables by integrating the covariance structure and is competitive to many other existing rules. The criterion however requires the measurement dimension be smaller than the sample size. The trace-based criterion, in contrast, is an independence rule and effective in the ""large dimension-small sample size"" scenario. An appealing property of these two criteria is that their implementation is straightforward and there is no need for preliminary variable selection or use of turning parameters. Their asymptotic misclassification probabilities are derived using the theory of large dimensional random matrices. Their competitive performances are illustrated by intensive Monte Carlo experiments and a real data analysis.","High dimensional classification,Large sample covariance matrix,Delocalization,Determinant-based criterion,Trace-based criterion","DISCRIMINANT,MISCLASSIFICATION,PROBABILITIES,EXPRESSION,VARIABLES,MATRICES,CANCER,TESTS","Li, Zhaoyuan@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Yao, Jianfeng@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Li, Zhaoyuan@University of Hong Kong::Yao, Jianfeng@University of Hong Kong",not exist,"no title+Bai, ZD; Silverstein, JW.+Spectral Analysis of Large Dimensional Random Matrices+2010::Effect of high dimension: By an example of a two sample problem+Bai, ZD; Saranadasa, H+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 1996::ENHANCEMENT OF THE APPLICABILITY OF MARKOWITZ'S PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION BY UTILIZING RANDOM MATRIX THEORY+Bai, Zhidong; Liu, Huixia; Wong, Wing-Keung+MATHEMATICAL FINANCE+OCT 2009::Some theory for Fisher's linear discriminant function, 'naive Bayes', and some alternatives when there are many more variables than observations+Bickel, PJ; Levina, E+BERNOULLI+DEC 2004::Local Post-Stratification in Dual System Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation for the US Census+Chen, Song Xi; Tang, Cheng Yong; Mule, Vincent T., Jr.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2010::Asymptotic probabilities of misclassification of two discriminant functions in cases of high dimensional data+Cheng, Y+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAR 15 2004::HIGH-DIMENSIONAL CLASSIFICATION USING FEATURES ANNEALED INDEPENDENCE RULES+Fan, Jianqing; Fan, Yingying+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2008::A road to classification in high dimensional space: the regularized optimal affine discriminant+Fan, Jianqing; Feng, Yang; Tong, Xin+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2012::The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems+Fisher, RA+ANNALS OF EUGENICS+SEP 1936::Molecular classification of cancer: Class discovery and class prediction by gene expression monitoring+Golub, TR; Slonim, DK; Tamayo, P; et al.+SCIENCE+OCT 15 1999::Modeling menstrual cycle length using a mixture distribution+Guo, Y; Manatunga, AK; Chen, SD; et al.+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2006::Discriminant analysis of multivariate repeated measures data with a Kronecker product structured covariance matrices+Krzysko, Miroslaw; Skorzybut, Michal+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2009::Fast nonparametric classification based on data depth+Lange, Tatjana; Mosler, Karl; Mozharovskyi, Pavlo+STATISTICAL PAPERS+FEB 2014::Error rates in classification consisting of discrete and continuous variables in the presence of covariates+Leung, CY+STATISTICAL PAPERS+APR 2001::TWO SAMPLE TESTS FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL COVARIANCE MATRICES+Li, Jun; Chen, Song Xi+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2012::ASYMPTOTIC-EXPANSION OF THE MISCLASSIFICATION PROBABILITIES OF D-CRITERIA AND A-CRITERIA FOR DISCRIMINATION FROM 2 HIGH-DIMENSIONAL POPULATIONS USING THE THEORY OF LARGE DIMENSIONAL RANDOM MATRICES+SARANADASA, H+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 1993::SPARSE LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS BY THRESHOLDING FOR HIGH DIMENSIONAL DATA+Shao, Jun; Wang, Yazhen; Deng, Xinwei; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2011::Some tests for the covariance matrix with fewer observations than the dimension under non-normality+Srivastava, Muni S.; Kollo, Tonu; von Rosen, Dietrich+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JUL 2011::Diagnosis of multiple cancer types by shrunken centroids of gene expression+Tibshirani, R; Hastie, T; Narasimhan, B; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+MAY 14 2002::no title+Vapnik, V.+The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory+1995"

A restricted class estimator in the mixed regression model with autocorrelated disturbances,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0664-4,APR 2016,24,0,"In this paper, a new estimator is proposed by combining basically the ordinary ridge regression estimator and the principal component regression estimator for a regression model which has multicollinearity and which satisfies some a priori stochastic linear restrictions. The performance of the proposed class estimator in this mixed regression model is compared with those of the mixed regression estimator, ridge regression estimator and the stochastic restricted ridge regression estimator in terms of the mean squared error matrix criterion. Tests for verifying the conditions of dominance of the proposed estimator over the others are also proposed. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo study and a numerical illustration are carried out to empirically study the performance of the estimators by the mean squared error values, and then to perform tests to verify if the conditions for superiority of the proposed estimator over the others hold.","r-k class estimator,Mixed regression estimator,Stochastic linear restrictions,Autocorrelated errors","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT REGRESSION,RIDGE-REGRESSION,LINEAR-REGRESSION,ERRORS","Chandra, Shalini@Banasthali Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Banasthali 304022, Rajasthan, India::Sarkar, Nityananda@Indian Stat Inst, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India","Chandra, Shalini@Banasthali Vidyapith::Sarkar, Nityananda@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute",not exist,"NONNEGATIVE AND POSITIVE DEFINITENESS OF MATRICES MODIFIED BY 2 MATRICES OF RANK ONE+BAKSALARY, JK; TRENKLER, G+LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS+JUN 1991::COMBINING RIDGE AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT REGRESSION - A MONEY DEMAND ILLUSTRATION+BAYE, MR; PARKER, DF+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1984::Forecasting using autocorrelated errors and multicollinear predictor variables+Bayhan, GM; Bayhan, M+COMPUTERS &amp; INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING+APR 1998::A SIMULATION STUDY OF RIDGE-REGRESSION ESTIMATORS WITH AUTO-CORRELATED ERRORS+FIRINGUETTI, LL+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+1989::no title+Gujarati, D.N.+Basic Econometrics+2002::RIDGE REGRESSION - BIASED ESTIMATION FOR NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS+HOERL, AE; KENNARD, RW+TECHNOMETRICS+1970::no title+Johnson, NL; Kotz, S.+Distributions in statistics: Continuous Univariate Distributions+1970::no title+JUDGE, Gerge G.; GRIFFITHS, William E.; HILL, R.

On the misleading signals in simultaneous schemes for the mean vector and covariance matrix of multivariate i.i.d. output,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0663-5,APR 2016,48,0,"The performance of a product often depends on several quality characteristics. Simultaneous schemes for the process mean vector and the covariance matrix () are essential to determine if unusual variation in the location and dispersion of a multivariate normal vector of quality characteristics has occurred. Misleading signals (MS) are likely to happen while using such simultaneous schemes and correspond to valid signals that lead to a misinterpretation of a shift in (resp. ) as a shift in (resp. ). This paper focuses on numerical illustrations that show that MS are fairly frequent, and on the use of stochastic ordering to qualitatively assess the impact of changes in and in the probabilities of misleading signals in simultaneous schemes for these parameters while dealing with multivariate normal i.i.d. output.","Generalized variance,Mahalanobis distance,Misleading signals,Simultaneous schemes,Stochastic ordering","AVERAGE CONTROL CHART,INDIVIDUAL OBSERVATIONS,PROCESS VARIABILITY,PERFORMANCE,VARIANCE","Ramos, Patricia Ferreira@Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CEMAT, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal::Morais, Manuel Cabral@Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CEMAT, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lisbon, Dept Math, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal::Pacheco, Antonio@Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CEMAT, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal@Univ Lisbon, Dept Math, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal::Schmid, Wolfgang@European Univ Viadrina, Dept Stat, Postfach 1786, D-15207 Frankfurt, Germany","Ramos, Patricia Ferreira@Universidade de Lisboa::Morais, Manuel Cabral@Universidade de Lisboa::Pacheco, Antonio@Universidade de Lisboa::Schmid, Wolfgang@European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder","Pacheco, Antonio@I-6371-2012::Cabral Morais, Manuel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2214-2910::Pacheco, Antonio@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5757-5652::Ferreira Ramos, Patricia@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5403-9782","Multivariate quality control+Alt, FB.+Encyclopedia of statistical sciences+1984::no title+Anderson, TW.+An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis+1984::no title+Antunes, C.+Assessment of the impact of the correlation on misleading signals in joint schemes for the mean and variance+2009::Statistical properties of the vertical bar S vertical bar multivariate control chart.+Aparisi, F; Jabaloyes, J; Carrion, A+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1999::Multivariate Control Charts for monitoring Covariance Matrix: A Review+Arthur, B.; Lin, K.

Testing homogeneity in a scale mixture of normal distributions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0665-3,APR 2016,35,2,"Scale mixtures of normal distributions, i.e., mixtures of normal distributions on the variance parameters, have wide applications. The testing of homogeneity is one of the fundamental challenges in the application of scale mixtures of normal distributions. Recently, Chen and Li (Ann Stat 37:2523-2542, 2009) proposed a class of EM-tests for testing homogeneity in mixtures of normal distributions on the mean parameters and both the mean and variance parameters. In this paper, we retool the EM-test proposed in Chen and Li (2009) for testing homogeneity in scale mixtures of normal distributions. We show that the EM-test has the simple null limiting distribution , an equal mixture of a distribution with point mass at zero and a distribution. We also use a computational method to provide an empirical value for the tuning parameter selection. Simulation studies show that the EM-test has an accurate size and is more powerful than existing methods such as the likelihood ratio test and the method in Chen and Li (2009) when the data are generated from scale mixtures of normal distributions or mixtures of normal distributions on both the mean and variance parameters with two component means being slightly different. To demonstrate the application of the proposed method, we analyze a real-data example.","Computer experiment,EM-test,Homogeneity test,Likelihood ratio test,Scale mixture of normal distributions","LIKELIHOOD-RATIO TEST,MICROARRAY DATA-ANALYSIS,STRUCTURAL PARAMETER,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,EM APPROACH,MODELS,ORDER","Niu, Xiaoqing@Univ Alberta, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G1, Canada::Li, Pengfei@Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada::Zhang, Peng@Zhejiang Univ, Dept Math, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Niu, Xiaoqing@University of Alberta::Li, Pengfei@University of Waterloo::Zhang, Peng@Zhejiang University",not exist,"SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF;

A bivariate INAR(1) model with different thinning parameters,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0667-1,APR 2016,26,1,"A bivariate integer-valued autoregressive time series model of order one is introduced. Regression coefficients of the model are random variables so the interaction between processes is stochastic. The dependance is achieved through survival components which are based on the binomial thinning operator. General form of the model is considered where counting series, which determine the survival components, are generated by different binomial distributions. Due to a large number of parameters, generalized method of moments and conditional maximum likelihood methods are suggested for parameters estimation and their asymptotic properties are established. Possible application of the model is discussed on real data.","Bivariate INAR(1) model,Binomial thinning,Geometric marginals,Generalized method of moments",TIME-SERIES MODEL,"Popovic, Predrag M.@Univ Nis, Fac Civil Engn & Architecture, Aleksandra Medvedeva 14, Nish 18000, Serbia","Popovic, Predrag M.@University of Nis",not exist,"First order integer valued autoregressive (INAR(l)) process+Al-Osh, M.

On phase II monitoring of the probability distributions of univariate continuous processes,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0668-0,APR 2016,38,2,"Statistical process control (SPC) charts are widely used in industry for monitoring the stability of certain sequential processes like manufacturing, health care systems etc. Most SPC charts assume that the parametric form of the ""in-control"" process distribution is available. However, it has been demonstrated in the literature that their performances are unreliable when the pre-specified process distribution is incorrect. Moreover, most SPC charts are designed to detect any shift in mean and/or variance. In real world problems, shifts in higher moments can happen without much change in mean or variance. If we fail to detect those and let the process run, it can eventually become worse and a shift in mean or variance can creep in. Moreover, the special cause that initiated the shift can inflict further damage to the system, and it may become a financial challenge to fix it. This paper provides an efficient and easy-to-use control chart for phase II monitoring of univariate continuous processes when the parametric form of the ""in-control"" process distribution is unknown, but Phase I observations that are believed to be i.i.d. realizations from unknown are available. Data-driven practical guidelines are also provided to choose the tuning parameter and the corresponding control limit of the proposed SPC chart. Numerical simulations and a real-life data analysis show that it can be used in many practical applications.","Control chart,Distributional change,Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,Non-parametric SPC,P value","NONPARAMETRIC CONTROL CHARTS,STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL,CUSUM,SHIFTS,ROBUSTNESS,LOCATION,SCHEME,MODEL,RUNS","Mukherjee, Partha Sarathi@Boise State Univ, Dept Math, Boise, ID 83725 USA","Mukherjee, Partha Sarathi@Boise State University",not exist,"Empirical non-parametric control charts: Estimation effects and corrections+Albers, W; Kallenberg, WCM+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+APR 2004::Data driven choice of control charts+Albers, W; Kallenberg, WCM; Nurdiati, S+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1 2006::CUMIN charts+Albers, Willem; Kallenberg, Wilbert C.

It is proved that the underlying distribution belongs to the class of symmetric distributions if and only if the first moment of the number of observations in the right neighborhood of the th order statistic and in the left neighborhood of theth order statistic from a sample of size are equal.

The focused information criterion for varying-coefficient partially linear measurement error models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0645-z,MAR 2016,27,2,"Under general parametric models, Claeskens and Hjort (J Am Stat Assoc 98:900-916, 2003) proposed a focused information criterion for model selection which emphasizes the accuracy of estimation for particular parameters of interest. This paper extends their framework to include a semi-parametric varying-coefficient partially linear model when covariates in both the parametric and the non-parametric parts are subject to measurement errors. We allow the covariance matrices of the measurement errors to be unknown and be estimated by replicated observations. Also, we derive the asymptotic properties of the frequentist model average estimator for the model in consideration, which generalizes the results obtained by Wang et al. (Electron J Stat 6:1017-1039, 2012). In addition to asymptotic properties, finite sample performance of the proposed methods are examined in a simulation study, and a data set obtained from Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (CSFII) is considered.","Focused information criterion,Measurement errors,Model averaging,Model selection,Semi-parametric models","IN-VARIABLES MODEL,SELECTION,INFERENCE","Wang, Hai Ying@Univ New Hampshire, Dept Math & Stat, Durham, NH 03824 USA::Chen, Xinjie@Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China::Flournoy, Nancy@Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Wang, Hai Ying@University System Of New Hampshire@University of New Hampshire::Chen, Xinjie@Chinese Academy of Sciences@Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS::Flournoy, Nancy@University of Missouri System@University of Missouri Columbia",not exist,"Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+2 INT S INF THEOR+1973::Model selection: An integral part of inference+Buckland, ST; Burnham, KP; Augustin, NH+BIOMETRICS+JUN 1997::no title+Carroll,, R.

The proposed approach is based on basis function approximations and the group SCAD penalty, which can incorporate information on the correlation structure within the same subject to achieve an efficient estimator. Furthermore, we discuss the asymptotic theory of our proposed procedure under suitable conditions, including consistency in variable selection and the oracle property in estimation. Finally, monte carlo simulations and a real data analysis are conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed procedure.","Generalized varying coefficient models,Longitudinal data,Quadratic inference function,Group SCAD penalty,Splines,Variable selection","QUADRATIC INFERENCE FUNCTIONS,ESTIMATING EQUATIONS,SPLINE ESTIMATION,DIVERGING NUMBER","Yang, Hu@Chongqing Univ, Coll Math & Stat, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China::Guo, Chaohui@Chongqing Univ, Coll Math & Stat, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China::Lv, Jing@Chongqing Univ, Coll Math & Stat, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China","Yang, Hu@Chongqing University::Guo, Chaohui@Chongqing University::Lv, Jing@Chongqing University","Yang, Hu@A-8108-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6589-8534","Penalized estimation in additive varying coefficient models using grouped regularization+Antoniadis, A.; Gijbels, I.; Lambert-Lacroix, S.+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2014::MODEL SELECTION FOR CORRELATED DATA WITH DIVERGING NUMBER OF PARAMETERS+Cho, Hyunkeun; Qu, Annie+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2013::An overview on quadratic inference function approaches for longitudinal data+Dziak, JJ; Li, R; Qu, A.+Frontiers of statistics, vol 1: new developments in biostatistics and bioinformatics+2009::no title+Dziak, JJ.+Penalized quadratic inference functions for variable selection in longitudinal research+2006::Statistical challenges with high dimensionality: feature selection in knowledge discovery+Fan, J; Li, R.+P INT C MATH MADR SP+2006::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Penalized estimating equations+Fu, WJJ+BIOMETRICS+MAR 2003::VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS+HASTIE, T; TIBSHIRANI, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1993::Varying-coefficient models and basis function approximations for the analysis of repeated measurements+Huang, JHZ; Wu, CO; Zhou, L+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 2002::Polynomial spline estimation and inference for varying coefficient models with longitudinal data+Huang, JHZ; Wu, CO; Zhou, L+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2004::VARIABLE SELECTION FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL GENERALIZED VARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS+Lian, Heng+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2012::LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS USING GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS+LIANG, KY; ZEGER, SL+BIOMETRIKA+APR 1986::no title+McCullagh, P.; Nelder, J.+Generalized Linear Models+1989::SPARSE VARYING COEFFICIENT MODELS FOR LONGITUDINAL DATA+Noh, Hoh Suk; Park, Byeong U.+STATISTICA SINICA+JUL 2010::Variable selection of varying coefficient models in quantile regression+Noh, Hohsuk; Chung, Kwanghun; Van Keilegom, Ingrid+ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+2012::Quadratic inference functions for varying-coefficient models with longitudinal data+Qu, A; Li, RZ+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2006::Improving generalised estimating equations using quadratic inference functions+Qu, A; Lindsay, BG; Li, B+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2000::Componentwise B-spline estimation for varying coefficient models with longitudinal data+Tang Qingguo; Cheng Longsheng+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2012::Variable selection in quantile varying coefficient models with longitudinal data+Tang, Yanlin; Wang, Huixia Judy; Zhu, Zhongyi+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 2013::GEE ANALYSIS OF CLUSTERED BINARY DATA WITH DIVERGING NUMBER OF COVARIATES+Wang, Lan+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2011::Penalized Generalized Estimating Equations for High-Dimensional Longitudinal Data Analysis+Wang, Lan; Zhou, Jianhui; Qu, Annie+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2012::Variable Selection in Nonparametric Varying-Coefficient Models for Analysis of Repeated Measurements+Wang, Lifeng; Li, Hongzhe; Huang, Jianhua Z.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2008::Variable selection in high-dimensional double generalized linear models+Xu, Dengke; Zhang, Zhongzhan; Wu, Liucang+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAY 2014::Variable Selection in High-dimensional Varying-coefficient Models with Global Optimality+Xue, Lan; Qu, Annie+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+JUN 2012::Consistent Model Selection for Marginal Generalized Additive Model for Correlated Data+Xue, Lan; Qu, Annie; Zhou, Jianhui+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2010"

The number of competing causes of the event of interest follows a Poisson distribution and the time for the event follows an Inverse-Gaussian distribution. The model takes into account the presence of censored data and covariates. For inferential purposes, a Bayesian approach via Markov Chain Monte Carlo was considered. Discussions on the model selection criteria, as well as a case deletion influence diagnostics are addressed for a joint posterior distribution based on the -divergence, which has several divergence measures as particular cases, such as Kullback-Leibler (K-L), -distance, norm and -square divergence measures.

"New multiple testing method under no dependency assumption, with application to multiple comparisons problem",STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0650-2,MAR 2016,23,0,"Traditional multiple hypotheses testing mainly focuses on constructing stepwise procedures under some error rate control, such as familywise error rate (FWER), false discovery rate, and so forth. However, most of these procedures are obtained in independent case, and when there exists correlation across tests, the dependency may increase or decrease the chance of false rejections. In this paper, a totally different testing method is proposed, which doesn't focus on specific error control, but pays attention to the overall performance of the collection of hypotheses and the structure utilization among hypotheses. Since the main purpose of multiple testing is to pick out the false ones from the whole hypotheses and present a rejection set, motivated by the principle of simple hypothesis testing, we give the final testing result based on the estimation of the set of all the true null hypotheses. Our method can be applied in any dependent case provided that a reasonable -value can be obtained for each intersection hypothesis. We illustrate the new procedures with application to multiple comparisons problems. Theoretical results show the consistency of our method, and investigate their FWER behavior. Simulation results suggest that our procedures have a better overall performance than some existing procedures in dependent cases, especially in the total number of type I and type II errors.","Largest true null set,Multiple comparisons problem,Multiple testing,Total errors","FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,P-VALUES","Wang, Li@China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Dept Math, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China::Xu, Xingzhong@Beijing Inst Technol, Dept Probabil & Stat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China::Yong, A.@Beijing Eastern Golden Finger Technol Co Ltd, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Wang, Li@China University of Mining & Technology::Xu, Xingzhong@Beijing Institute of Technology::Yong, A.@Unknow",not exist,"The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency+Benjamini, Y; Yekutieli, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2001::CONTROLLING THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE - A PRACTICAL AND POWERFUL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE TESTING+BENJAMINI, Y; HOCHBERG, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1995::Adaptive linear step-up procedures that control the false discovery rate+Benjamini, Yoav; Krieger, Abba M.; Yekutieli, Daniel+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2006::Global and multiple test procedures using ordered p-values - a review+Bernhard, G; Klein, M; Hommel, G+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JAN 2004::A NEW MULTIPLE TESTING METHOD IN THE DEPENDENT CASE+Cohen, Arthur; Sackrowitz, Harold B.; Xu, Minya+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2009::THE FUNCTIONAL-MODEL BASIS OF FIDUCIAL-INFERENCE+DAWID, AP; STONE, M+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::Empirical Bayes analysis of a microarray experiment+Efron, B; Tibshirani, R; Storey, JD; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Estimating False Discovery Proportion Under Arbitrary Covariance Dependence+Fan, Jianqing; Han, Xu; Gu, Weijie+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2012::no title+Hochberg, Y.; Tamhane, A.

Single-index composite quantile regression with heteroscedasticity and general error distributions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0646-y,MAR 2016,29,4,"It is known that composite quantile regression (CQR) could be much more efficient and sometimes arbitrarily more efficient than the least squares estimator. Based on CQR method, we propose a weighted CQR (WCQR) method for single-index models with heteroscedasticity and general error distributions. Because of the use of weights, the estimation bias is eliminated asymptotically. By comparing asymptotic relative efficiency, WCQR estimation outperforms the CQR estimation and least squares estimation. The simulation studies and a real data application are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.","Composite quantile regression,Asymptotic efficiency,Single-index model","MODELS,ESTIMATORS,EFFICIENT","Jiang, Rong@Donghua Univ, Dept Math, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China::Qian, Wei-Min@Tongji Univ, Dept Math, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China::Zhou, Zhan-Gong@Jiaxing Univ, Nanhu Coll, Jiaxing 314001, Peoples R China","Jiang, Rong@Donghua University::Qian, Wei-Min@Tongji University::Zhou, Zhan-Gong@Jiaxing University",not exist,"Estimation of general semi-parametric quantile regression+Fan, Yan; Zhu, Lixing+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAY 2013::no title+Gijbels, I.; Fan, J.+Local polynomial modeling and its applications.+1996::Test for single-index composite quantile regression+Jiang, R; Qian, WM; Zhou, ZG.+Hacettepe J Math Stat+2014::Testing in linear composite quantile regression models+Jiang, Rong; Qian, Wei-Min; Li, Jing-Ru+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+OCT 2014::Two step composite quantile regression for single-index models+Jiang, Rong; Zhou, Zhan-Gong; Qian, Wei-Min; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 2013::Single-index composite quantile regression+Jiang, Rong; Zhou, Zhan-Gong; Qian, Wei-Min; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN STATISTICAL SOCIETY+SEP 2012::Variable selection and coefficient estimation via composite quantile regression with randomly censored data+Jiang, Rong; Qian, Weimin; Zhou, Zhangong+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 2012::NEW EFFICIENT ESTIMATION AND VARIABLE SELECTION METHODS FOR SEMIPARAMETRIC VARYING-COEFFICIENT PARTIALLY LINEAR MODELS+Kai, Bo; Li, Runze; Zou, Hui+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2011::Local composite quantile regression smoothing: an efficient and safe alternative to local polynomial regression+Kai, Bo; Li, Runze; Zou, Hui+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2010::Limiting distributions for L-1 regression estimators under general conditions+Knight, K+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 1998::ESTIMATION AND TESTING FOR PARTIALLY LINEAR SINGLE-INDEX MODELS+Liang, Hua; Liu, Xiang; Li, Runze; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2010::Identitiability of single-index models and additive-index models+Lin, Wei; Kulasekera, K.

Robust estimation of location and concentration parameters for the von Mises-Fisher distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0648-9,MAR 2016,35,0,"Robust estimation of location and concentration parameters for the von Mises-Fisher distribution is discussed. A key reparametrisation is achieved by expressing the two parameters as one vector on the Euclidean space. With this representation, we first show that maximum likelihood estimator for the von Mises-Fisher distribution is not robust in some situations. Then we propose two families of robust estimators which can be derived as minimisers of two density power divergences. The presented families enable us to estimate both location and concentration parameters simultaneously. Some properties of the estimators are explored. Simple iterative algorithms are suggested to find the estimates numerically. It is shown that the presented approaches can be utilised to estimate either the location or concentration parameter. A comparison with the existing robust estimators is given as well as discussion on difference and similarity between the two proposed estimators. A simulation study is made to evaluate finite sample performance of the estimators. We apply the proposed methods to a sea star dataset and discuss the selection of the tuning parameters and outlier detection.","Directional data,Divergence,Influence function,Outlier detection,Robust inference","DIRECTIONAL-DATA,DIVERGENCE,SPHERE","Kato, Shogo@Inst Stat Math, 10-3 Midori Cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908562, Japan::Eguchi, Shinto@Inst Stat Math, 10-3 Midori Cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908562, Japan","Kato, Shogo@Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS)@Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM)::Eguchi, Shinto@Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS)@Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM)","Eguchi, Shinto@A-9103-2012","Sine-skewed circular distributions+Abe, Toshihiro; Pewsey, Arthur+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2011::Robust estimation for circular data+Agostinelli, Claudio+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 15 2007::Robust and efficient estimation by minimising a density power divergence+Basu, A; Harris, IR; Hjort, NL; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::ON MEDIAN-TYPE ESTIMATORS OF DIRECTION FOR THE VON MISES-FISHER DISTRIBUTION+CHAN, YM; HE, XM+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1993::SPATIAL MEDIAN AND DIRECTIONAL-DATA+DUCHARME, GR; MILASEVIC, P+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1987::ESTIMATING THE CONCENTRATION OF THE LANGEVIN DISTRIBUTION+DUCHARME, GR; MILASEVIC, P+CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE+JUN 1990::no title+Fisher, N.

A novel extension of randomly weighted averages,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0615-5,NOV 2015,20,1,We study a well-known problem concerning a random variable uniformly distributed between two independent random variables. A new extension has been introduced for this problem and fairly large classes of randomly weighted average distributions are identified by their generalized Stieltjes transforms.

A general permutation approach for analyzing repeated measures ANOVA and mixed-model designs,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0617-3,NOV 2015,25,2,"Repeated measures ANOVA and mixed-model designs are the main classes of experimental designs used in psychology. The usual analysis relies on some parametric assumptions (typically Gaussianity). In this article, we propose methods to analyze the data when the parametric conditions do not hold. The permutation test, which is a non-parametric test, is suitable for hypothesis testing and can be applied to experimental designs. The application of permutation tests in simpler experimental designs such as factorial ANOVA or ANOVA with only between-subject factors has already been considered. The main purpose of this paper is to focus on more complex designs that include only within-subject factors (repeated measures) or designs that include both within-subject and between-subject factors (mixed-model designs). First, a general approximate permutation test (permutation of the residuals under the reduced model or reduced residuals) is proposed for any repeated measures and mixed-model designs, for any number of repetitions per cell, any number of subjects and factors and for both balanced and unbalanced designs (all-cell-filled). Next, a permutation test that uses residuals that are exchangeable up to the second moment is introduced for balanced cases in the same class of experimental designs. This permutation test is therefore exact for spherical data. Finally, we provide simulations results for the comparison of the level and the power of the proposed methods.",,"FACTORIAL-DESIGNS,TESTS,VARIANCE","Kherad-Pajouh, Sara@Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Renaud, Olivier@Methodol & Data Anal Grp, Dept Psychol, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland","Kherad-Pajouh, Sara@University of California System@University of California Berkeley::Renaud, Olivier@Unknow",not exist,"Permutation tests for multi-factorial analysis of variance+Anderson, MJ; Ter Braak, CJF+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+FEB 2003::A discussion of permutation tests conditional to observed responses in unreplicated 2(M) full factorial designs+Basso, D; Salmaso, L+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2006::no title+Basso, D; Pesarin, F; Salmaso, L<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Solari, A</span>.+Permutation tests for stochastic ordering and ANOVA: theory and applications with R+2009::Synchronized permutation tests in replicated I x J designs+Basso, Dario; Chiarandini, Marco; Salmaso, Luigi+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 2007::no title+Cardinal, R.

For the problem of testing for the equality of the two unknown functions in the case of homoscedastic error structure and observation at equidistant points, we derive a new procedure with adaptive choice of the number of the coefficients used in the hypotheses testing. Our approach is based on approximation of the most powerful test using the full knowledge of the regression functions. The results are justified by theoretical arguments and the superiority of the new procedure is also confirmed by a simulation study.","Adaptive tests,Empirical Fourier coefficients,Testing for functional data","GOODNESS-OF-FIT,NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,SELECTION,EQUALITY,MODELS,TESTS","Melas, Viatcheslav B.@St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Math & Mech, St Petersburg 198504, Russia::Pepelyshev, Andrey@St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Math & Mech, St Petersburg 198504, Russia::Shpilev, Petr@St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Math & Mech, St Petersburg 198504, Russia::Salmaso, Luigi@Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy::Corain, Livio@Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy::Arboretti, Rosa@Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, I-35020 Padua, Italy","Melas, Viatcheslav B.@Saint Petersburg State University::Pepelyshev, Andrey@Saint Petersburg State University::Shpilev, Petr@Saint Petersburg State University::Salmaso, Luigi@University of Padua::Corain, Livio@University of Padua::Arboretti, Rosa@University of Padua","Corain, Livio@T-2417-2017::Melas, Viatcheslav@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8343-1006::Shpilev, Petr@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9704-7993::CORAIN, LIVIO@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8104-1255","ON THE USE OF NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION FOR CHECKING LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS+AZZALINI, A; BOWMAN, A+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1993::TESTING THE (PARAMETRIC) NULL MODEL HYPOTHESIS IN (SEMIPARAMETRIC) PARTIAL AND GENERALIZED SPLINE MODELS+COX, D; KOH, E; WAHBA, G; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1988::TESTING THE EQUALITY OF NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION-CURVES+DELGADO, MA+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 18 1993::Nonparametric analysis of covariance+Dette, H; Neumeyer, N+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2001::TESTING GOODNESS-OF-FIT IN REGRESSION VIA ORDER SELECTION CRITERIA+EUBANK, RL; HART, JD+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1992::TESTING THE GOODNESS OF FIT OF A LINEAR-MODEL VIA NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION TECHNIQUES+EUBANK, RL; SPIEGELMAN, CH+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1990::Test of significance bsed on Wavelet thresholding and Neyman's truncation+Fan, J.+J Am Stat Assoc+1996::Goodness-of-fit tests for parametric regression models+Fan, JQ; Huang, LS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 2001::no title+Ferraty, F; Vieu, P.+Nonparametric Functional Data Analysis: Theory and Practice+2006::no title+Gradshteyn, I.

A diagnostic tool for regression analysis of complex survey data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0623-5,NOV 2015,10,0,"Although a nonparametric regression model allows us to obtain a graphical display of the relationship between the response variable and the independent variables, the exact form of the regression function is not evident. This weakness can be overcome by a parametric model since the relationship between the dependent and the independent variables is specified mathematically. The object of this paper is to introduce a new graphical approach, called the shift function plot, with which a hypothesis test is constructed to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of a parametric regression model. Under multi-stage stratified sampling schemes, we apply the shift function plots to survey data. Asymptotic properties of the survey estimator of the shift function are established. An empirical example from the 1990 Ontario Health Survey is used to illustrate the application of the shift function.","Nonparametric regression,Regression specification test,Probability sampling,Large data",,"Wang, Zilin@Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Math, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada::Bellhouse, David@Univ Western Ontario, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON, Canada","Wang, Zilin@Wilfrid Laurier University::Bellhouse, David@Western University (University of Western Ontario)",not exist,"Local polynomial regression techniques in complex surveys+Bellhouse, D.R.; Stafford, J.E.+Survey Methodology+2001::Density estimation from complex surveys+Bellhouse, DR; Stafford, JE+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 1999::ON THE VARIANCES OF ASYMPTOTICALLY NORMAL ESTIMATORS FROM COMPLEX SURVEYS+BINDER, DA+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1983::PLOTTING WITH CONFIDENCE - GRAPHICAL COMPARISONS OF 2 POPULATIONS+DOKSUM, KA; SIEVERS, GL+BIOMETRIKA+1976::Regression analysis for sample surveys+Fuller, W.

Respondent privacy and estimation efficiency in randomized response surveys for discrete-valued sensitive variables,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0624-4,NOV 2015,25,1,"In some socio-economic surveys, data are collected on sensitive issues such as tax evasion, criminal conviction, drug use, etc. In such surveys, direct questioning of respondents is not of much use and the randomized response technique is used instead. A few researchers have studied the issue of privacy protection for surveys where the objective is to estimate the proportion of persons bearing the sensitive trait. Not much is known about respondent protection when the variable under study is a discrete quantitative variable and the objective is to estimate the population mean. In this article we study this issue. We propose a scheme for this issue and a measure of privacy. We show that given a stipulated level of this privacy measure, we can determine the parameter of the randomization device so as to maximize the efficiency of estimation, while guaranteeing the desired level of privacy protection.","Jeopardy measure,Numerical stigmatizing variable,Revealing probability,Socio-economic sample surveys","UNRELATED QUESTION,COMPLEX SURVEY,PROTECTION,MODEL","Bose, Mausumi@Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata 700108, India","Bose, Mausumi@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute",not exist,"EFFICIENCY VERSUS PROTECTION IN A GENERAL RANDOMIZED RESPONSE MODEL+ANDERSON, H+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+1977::Randomized response techniques for complex survey designs+Arnab, Raghunath; Dorffner, Georg+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JAN 2007::A randomized response procedure for multiple-sensitive questions+Barabesi, Lucio; Franceschi, Sara; Marcheselli, Marzia+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2012::no title+Chaudhuri, A.+Randomized response and indirect questioning techniques in surveys+2011::no title+CHAUDHURI A+RANDOMIZED RESPONSES+1988::Randomized Response Techniques: A Review+Chaudhuri, A; Mukherjee, R.+Statistica Neerlandica+Mar 1987::Estimation of a sensitive proportion by Warner's randomized response data through inverse sampling+Chaudhuri, Arijit; Bose, Mausumi; Dihidar, Kajal+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAY 2011::Estimating sensitive proportions by Warner's randomized response technique using multiple randomized responses from distinct persons sampled+Chaudhuri, Arijit; Bose, Mausumi; Dihidar, Kajal+STATISTICAL PAPERS+FEB 2011::Randomized response in stratified sampling+Christofides, TC+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JAN 15 2005::Procuring honest responses indirectly+Chua, TC; Tsui, AK+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP 1 2000::A class of estimators for quantitative sensitive data+Diana, Giancarlo; Perri, Pier Francesco+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2011::Estimating a sensitive proportion through randomized response procedures based on auxiliary information+Diana, Giancarlo; Perri, Pier Francesco+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 2009::Efficiency comparison of unrelated question models based on same privacy protection degree+Giordano, Sabrina; Perri, Pier Francesco+STATISTICAL PAPERS+NOV 2012::A stratified unrelated question randomized response model+Kim, Jong-Min; Elam, Matthew E.+STATISTICAL PAPERS+APR 2007::ASKING SENSITIVE QUESTIONS INDIRECTLY+KUK, AYC+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1990::DEGREE OF PROTECTION IN RANDOMIZED INTERVIEWS+LANKE, J+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+1976::CHOICE OF UNRELATED QUESTION IN SIMMONS VERSION OF RANDOMIZED RESPONSE+LANKE, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1975::Respondent jeopardy and optimal designs in randomized response models+Leysieffer, RW; Warner, SL.+J Amer Stat Assoc+1976::A UNIFIED APPROACH TO MEASURES OF PRIVACY IN RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE MODELS - A UTILITARIAN PERSPECTIVE+LJUNGQVIST, L+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::ASYMPTOTICALLY OPTIMAL RANDOMIZED RESPONSE PROCEDURES+LOYNES, RM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1976::AN IMPROVED RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE STRATEGY+MANGAT, NS+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1994::A unified framework for analysis and comparison of randomized response surveys of binary characteristics+Nayak, Tapan K.; Adeshiyan, Samson A.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 2009::Unbiasedly estimating the total of a stigmatizing variable from a complex survey on permitting options for direct or randomized responses+Pal, Sanghamitra+STATISTICAL PAPERS+APR 2008::Randomized response, statistical disclosure control and misclassification: a review+van den Hout, A; van der Heijden, PGM+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+AUG 2002::RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE - A SURVEY TECHNIQUE FOR ELIMINATING EVASIVE ANSWER BIAS+WARNER, SL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1965"

We show that the proposed distribution can be expressed as a shape mixture of the multivariate extended skew-normal distribution. Applying this property leads to deriving stochastic representations for the proposed distribution. Also we give some basic properties for this new family. Computational techniques using EM-type algorithms are employed for iteratively computing maximum likelihood estimates.

Simultaneous inferences: new method of maximum combination,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0627-1,NOV 2015,14,0,"The Scheff, method is used to carry out simultaneous inferences on many linear combinations of parameters. Frequently these combinations arise from the need to explain the causes of significance of the homogeneity test for all the parameters. This paper proposes an alternative methodology based on the maximization of the contrast statistic in the coefficient of the combination. This new method, compatible with Scheff,'s method, in addition yields the statistic which should be used for the global test, as well as the combination of maximum significance. The method is illustrated in the cases of means of normal distributions and binomial proportions (independent samples). In the second case, the method allows a homogeneity test that is more powerful than Pearson's classic chi-squared test to be obtained.

Finite sample properties of the tests are examined, and in the case of additive outliers it is shown that the LS based tests are grossly over-sized whereas the size of our tests is close to the nominal size.

Robust estimation for spatial semiparametric varying coefficient partially linear regression,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0629-z,NOV 2015,35,0,"This paper considers a varying coefficient partially linear regression with spatial data. A general formulation is used to treat mean regression, median regression, quantile regression and robust mean regression in one setting. The parametric estimators of the model are obtained through piecewise local polynomial approximation of the nonparametric coefficient functions. The local estimators of unknown coefficient functions are obtained by replacing the parameters in model with their estimators and using local linear approximations.The asymptotic distribution of the estimator of the unknown parameter vector is established.

Estimation and inference in multivariate Markov chains,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0630-6,NOV 2015,17,0,"The literature of Markov chains has recently focused on modeling multiple categorical data sequences. The usual procedure for handling these multivariate Markov chains (MMC), with categorical data and states, consists of expanding the state space by considering new states. This model rapidly becomes intractable even with moderate values of and due to the excessive number of parameters to estimate. Ching and Fung (2002) found a way to cope with the intractability of the conventional MMC. They also suggested a method of estimation that proved to be inefficient. Zhu and Ching (2010) proposed another method of estimation based on minimizing the prediction error with equality and inequality restrictions. However, both these procedures treat the estimation problem as a mechanic method, without addressing the statistical inference problem. In this article we try to overcome this shortcoming and, at the same time, we propose a new approach to estimate MMC (under Ching et al. hypothesis) which avoids imposing equality and inequality restrictions on the parameters. We illustrate the model and the estimation method with two applications on financial time series data.","Multivariate Markov chains,Nonlinear least squares,Predictability of investment recommendations,Statistical inference",MODEL,"Nicolau, Joo@Univ Lisbon, Sch Econ & Management ISEG, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal@CEMAPRE ISEG, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal::Riedlinger, Flavio Ivo@Univ Lisbon, Sch Econ & Management ISEG, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal@CEMAPRE ISEG, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal","Nicolau, Joo@Universidade de Lisboa::Riedlinger, Flavio Ivo@Universidade de Lisboa","Nicolau, Joao@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5401-0309::RIEDLINGER DE MAGALHAES, FLAVIO IVO@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7460-5481","no title+Billingsley, P.+Convergence of Probability Measures+1999::A multivariate Markov chain model for categorical data sequences and its applications in demand predictions+Ching, W.; Fungs, E.+IMA J.

The role of orthogonal polynomials in adjusting hyperpolic secant and logistic distributions to analyse financial asset returns,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0633-3,NOV 2015,32,4,"In this paper, we will tackle the issue of accounting for skewness and potentially severe excess kurtosis of the empirical distribution of a random variable of interest by adjusting a parent leptokurtic distribution, using orthogonal polynomials. We will show that the polynomial shape adapter that allows the transformation from a given parent to a target distribution is a linear combination of the orthogonal polynomials associated to the former with coefficients depending on the difference between the moments of these two distributions. A recent work (Zoia, Commun Stat Theory Methods 39(1):52-64, 2010) has shown how to adjust the normal density by using Hermite polynomials but this application is suitable only for series with moderate kurtosis (lower than 5). This is why we provide two other parent distributions, the logistic and the hyperbolic secant which, once polynomially adjusted, can be used to reshape series with higher degrees of kurtosis. We will apply these results for modelling heavy-tailed and skewed distributions of financial asset returns by using both the conditional and unconditional approaches. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of using the polynomially adapted distributions in place of popular alternatives.","Orthogonal polynomials,Kurtosis,Skewness,Financial returns","PARTIALLY ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION,MODELS,SKEWNESS","Bagnato, Luca@Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Discipline Matemat Finanza Matemat &, I-20123 Milan, Italy::Poti, Valerio@UCD Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Dublin, Ireland::Zoia, Maria Grazia@Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Discipline Matemat Finanza Matemat &, I-20123 Milan, Italy","Bagnato, Luca@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart::Poti, Valerio@Unknow::Zoia, Maria Grazia@Catholic University of the Sacred Heart",not exist,"Testing serial independence via density-based measures of divergence+Bagnato, L; De Capitani, L; Punzo, A.+Methodol Comput Appl Probab+2013::A FURTHER LOOK AT ROBUSTNESS VIA BAYESS THEOREM+BOX, GEP; TIAO, GC+BIOMETRIKA+1962::no title+Bronshtein, I.; Semendyayev, K.; Musiol, G.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Mhlig, H</span>.+HDB MATH+2007::no title+Chihara, T.

Further remarks on the connection between fixed linear model and mixed linear model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0634-2,NOV 2015,24,3,"The linear mixed model , where is the vector of fixed effects and the vector of random effects, has strong links with a particular augmented linear model including only fixed effects. This goes back to Henderson's mixed model equations and was recently exploited by Haslett and Puntanen (Stat Papers 51:465-475, 2010), who restated Henderson's result in a model with possibly singular covariance matrices. In this paper we point out that the connection between the two models is actually very straightforward: a mixed linear model can be obtained from the augmented model by a simple linear transformation. This, for example, immediately opens up a new viewpoint for studying the relationship between the BLUEs and BLUPs in the two models. In doing so we discuss a modification of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem as well as some not so well established theorems about the BLUPs of random errors.","Best linear unbiased estimator,Best linear unbiased predictor,Linear mixed model,Linear fixed effects model,Henderson's mixed model equation,Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem","GAUSS-MARKOV MODEL,RESTRICTIONS,MATRIX","Arendacka, B.@Phys Tech Bundesanstalt, Berlin, Germany::Puntanen, S.@Univ Tampere, Sch Informat Sci, Tampere 33014, Finland","Arendacka, B.@Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)::Puntanen, S.@University of Tampere",not exist,"A STUDY OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE NATURAL RESTRICTIONS ON ESTIMATION PROBLEMS IN THE SINGULAR GAUSS-MARKOV MODEL+BAKSALARY, JK; RAO, CR; MARKIEWICZ, A+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 1992::no title+BHIMASANKARAM P+SANKHYA B+1996::Plane Answers to Complex Questions: The Theory of Linear Models, Fourth Edition+Christensen, Ronald+PLANE ANSWERS TO COMPLEX QUESTIONS: THE THEORY OF LINEAR MODELS, FOURTH EDITION+2011::no title+Davidson, R.; Mackinnon, J.+Estimation and Inference in Economics+1993::no title+Davidson, Russell; MacKinnon, James G.+Econometric Theory and Methods+2004::no title+GROSS J+DISCUSSIONES MATH PR+2005::Estimation under a general partitioned linear model+Gross, J; Puntanen, S+LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS+DEC 15 2000::The general Gauss-Markov model with possibly singular dispersion matrix+Gross, J+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUL 2004::On the equality of the BLUPs under two linear mixed models+Haslett, Stephen J.; Puntanen, Simo+METRIKA+NOV 2011::Equality of BLUEs or BLUPs under two linear models using stochastic restrictions+Haslett, Stephen J.; Puntanen, Simo+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 2010::BEST LINEAR UNBIASED ESTIMATION AND PREDICTION UNDER A SELECTION MODEL+HENDERSON, CR+BIOMETRICS+1975::THE ESTIMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND GENETIC TRENDS FROM RECORDS SUBJECT TO CULLING+HENDERSON, CR; KEMPTHORNE, O; SEARLE, SR; et al.+BIOMETRICS+1959::Some algebra and geometry for hierarchical models, applied to diagnostics+Hodges, JS+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1998::A direct derivation of the REML likelihood function+LaMotte, Lynn Roy+STATISTICAL PAPERS+APR 2007::Hierarchical generalised linear models: A synthesis of generalised linear models, random-effect models and structured dispersions+Lee, Y; Nelder, JA+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2001::no title+Puntanen, S; Styan, GPH; Isotalo, J.+Matrix tricks for linear statistical models, our personal top twenty+2011::Generalized Inverse of Matrices and its Applications+Rao, C.

On empirical cumulative residual entropy and a goodness-of-fit test for exponentiality,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0603-9,AUG 2015,21,3,"The cumulative residual entropy (CRE) is a new measure of information and an alternative to the Shannon differential entropy in which the density function is replaced by the survival function. This new measure overcomes deficiencies of the differential entropy while extending the Shannon entropy from the discrete random variable cases to the continuous counterpart. Some properties of the cumulative residual entropy, its estimation and applications has been studied by many researchers. The objective of this paper is twofold. In the first part, we give a central limit theorem result for the empirical cumulative residual entropy based on a right censored random sample from an unknown distribution. In the second part, we use the CRE of the comparison distribution function to propose a goodness-of-fit test for the exponential distribution. The performance of the test statistic is evaluated using a simulation study.

Estimating doubly stochastic Poisson process with affine intensities by Kalman filter,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0606-6,AUG 2015,54,0,"This paper proposes a Kalman filter formulation for parameter estimation of doubly stochastic Poisson processes (DSPP) with stochastic affine intensities. To achieve this aim, an analytical expression for the probability distribution functions of the corresponding DSPP for any intensity from the class of affine diffusions is obtained. More detailed results are provided for one- and two-factor Feller and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusions. A Monte Carlo study indicates that the proposed method is a reliable procedure for moderate sample sizes. An empirical analysis of one- and two-factor Feller and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models is carried out using high frequency transaction data.","Doubly stochastic Poisson process,Affine diffusion,Kalman filter,Order book","TERM STRUCTURE,COX PROCESS,MODELS,SERIES,TESTS","De Genaro, Alan@Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil@BM&FBOVESPA, Secur Commod & Futures Exchange, Sao Paulo, Brazil::Simonis, Adilson@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Math & Stat, Sao Paulo, Brazil","De Genaro, Alan@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Simonis, Adilson@Universidade de Sao Paulo","De Genaro, Alan@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9839-6116","Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle+Akaike, H.+Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike+1998::Laplace transforms for integrals of markov processes+Albanese, C; Lawi, S.+Markov Process Rel Fields+2004::A Cox process with log-normal intensity+Basu, S; Dassios, A+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+OCT 18 2002::no title+Bielecki, T.

Reliability sampling plans for a lognormal distribution under progressive first-failure censoring with cost constraint,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0608-4,AUG 2015,25,3,"In this paper, we establish reliability sampling plans for a two-parameter lognormal distribution when it is known that samples are progressive first-failure censored. An EM algorithm is developed to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of unknown parameters. Reliability sampling plans are obtained using two different criteria, namely minimizing the expected test time and minimizing the determinant of the variance covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimates, under a restriction on the total cost associated with the experiment and for given specifications on the operating characteristic curve.

Uncertainty intervals for regression parameters with non-ignorable missingness in the outcome,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0610-x,AUG 2015,26,5,"When estimating regression models with missing outcomes, scientists usually have to rely either on a missing at random assumption (missing mechanism is independent from the outcome given the observed variables) or on exclusion restrictions (some of the covariates affecting the missingness mechanism do not affect the outcome). Both these hypotheses are controversial in applications since they are typically not testable from the data. The alternative, which we pursue here, is to derive identification sets (instead of point identification) for the parameters of interest when allowing for a missing not at random mechanism. The non-ignorability of this mechanism is quantified with a parameter. When the latter can be bounded with a priori information, a bounded identification set follows. Our approach allows the outcome to be continuous and unbounded and relax distributional assumptions. Estimation of the identification sets can be performed via ordinary least squares and sampling variability can be incorporated yielding uncertainty intervals achieving a coverage of at least ( probability. Our work is motivated by a study on predictors of body mass index (BMI) change in middle age men allowing us to identify possible predictors of BMI change even when assuming little on the missing mechanism.","Heckman model,Informative dropout,Selection models,Sensitivity analysis,Set identification,Two stage least squares","SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS,SELECTIVITY BIAS,INCOMPLETE-DATA,MODELS,NONRESPONSE","Genback, Minna@Umea Univ, Dept Stat, Umea Sch Business & Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden::Stanghellini, Elena@Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, I-06100 Perugia, Italy::de Luna, Xavier@Umea Univ, Dept Stat, Umea Sch Business & Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Genback, Minna@Umea University::Stanghellini, Elena@University of Perugia::de Luna, Xavier@Umea University",not exist,"Proxy Pattern-Mixture Analysis for Survey Nonresponse+Andridge, Rebecca R.; Little, Roderick J.

Quality surveillance with EWMA control charts based on exact control limits,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0612-8,AUG 2015,21,2,"The control charts are main tools of statistical surveillance of quality in production processes. Exponentially weighted moving average charts that make use of exact control limits are discussed in detail in this paper. We start by assessing the impact of the smoothing constant not only in the in-control average run length (ARL) of upper one-sided EWMA charts with exact control limits, but also in the range of the exact control limits of such charts with a common in-control ARL value (i.e. matched in-control). Based on the analytical results and on an extensive simulation study we conclude that the out-of-control ARL of matched in-control upper one-sided EWMA charts with exact control limits increases with . This in turn suggests the use of values as close to the zero as possible and motivates what we called the (upper one-sided) limit chart. Its performance is extensively studied with regard to the ARL. Finally, we investigate the impact of on the ARL of EWMA charts with asymptotic control limits; the (maximum) conditional average delay is also addressed as an additional performance measure.","Statistical process control,Run length,Stochastic ordering","WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE,FAST INITIAL RESPONSE,CONTROL SCHEMES,ENHANCEMENTS","Morais, Manuel Cabral@Inst Super Tecn, Dept Math, Lisbon, Portugal@Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Math & Its Applicat CEMAT, Lisbon, Portugal::Okhrin, Yarema@Univ Augsburg, Fac Business & Econ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany::Schmid, Wolfgang@European Univ Viadrina, Dept Stat, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany","Morais, Manuel Cabral@Universidade de Lisboa::Okhrin, Yarema@University of Augsburg::Schmid, Wolfgang@European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder","Cabral Morais, Manuel@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2214-2910","EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES - PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS - DISCUSSION+BAXLEY, RV+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1990::no title+Conte, SD; Boor, CWD.+Elementary numerical analysis: an algorithmic approach+1980::AN EWMA FOR MONITORING A PROCESS STANDARD-DEVIATION+CROWDER, SV; HAMILTON, MD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1992::Optimal Surveillance Based on Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages+Frisen, M.; Sonesson, C. .+Sequential Analysis+2006::THE EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE+HUNTER, JS+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 1986::Early SQC: A historical supplement+Juran, JM+QUALITY PROGRESS+SEP 1997::EWMA Schemes with Non-homogeneous Transition Kernels+Knoth, S.+Sequential Analysis+2003::Fast initial response features for EWMA control charts+Knoth, S+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JAN 2005::EWMA Charts for Multivariate Time Series+Kramer, H.

A wavelet-based hybrid approach to estimate variance function in heteroscedastic regression models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0614-6,AUG 2015,21,1,We propose a wavelet-based hybrid approach to estimate the variance function in a nonparametric heteroscedastic fixed design regression model. A data-driven estimator is constructed by applying wavelet thresholding along with the technique of sparse representation to the difference-based initial estimates. We prove the convergence of the proposed estimator. The numerical results show that the proposed estimator performs better than the existing variance estimation procedures in the mean square sense over a range of smoothness classes.,"Heteroscedasticity,Wavelet thresholding,Basic pursuit,Overcomplete dictionary","NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION,ATOMIC DECOMPOSITION,DICTIONARIES,NOISE","Palanisamy, T.@Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita Sch Engn, Dept Math, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India::Ravichandran, J.@Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita Sch Engn, Dept Math, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India","Palanisamy, T.@Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University::Ravichandran, J.@Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University","Joghee, Ravichandran@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8284-8851","On the uniqueness of overcomplete dictionaries, and a practical way to retrieve them+Aharon, Michal; Elad, Michael; Bruckstein, Alfred M.+LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS+JUL 1 2006::Wavelet estimators in nonparametric regression: a comparative study+Antoniadis, A.; Bigot, J.; Sapatinas, T.+Journal of Statistical Software+2001::Variance function estimation in regression by wavelet methods+Antoniadis, A; Lavergne, C.+Wavelets and Statistics+1994::Wavelet methods in statistics: Some recent developments and their applications+Antoniadis, Anestis+STATISTICS SURVEYS+2007::Wavelet thresholding for non-necessarily Gaussian noise: Idealism+Averkamp, R; Houdre, C+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2003::Minimax estimation of a multivariate normal mean under arbitrary quadratic loss+Berger, J.+J Multivar Anal+1976::SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND TRANSFORMATIONS+BOX, G+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1988::Statistical analysis of a telephone call center: A queueing-science perspective+Brown, L; Gans, N; Mandelbaum, A; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2005::Variance estimation in nonparametric regression via the difference sequence method+Brown, Lawrence D.; Levine, M.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2007::Adaptive variance function estimation in heteroscedastic nonparametric regression+Cai, T.; Wang, L.+Annals of Statistics+2004::Atomic decomposition by basis pursuit+Chen, SSB; Donoho, DL; Saunders, MA+SIAM REVIEW+MAR 2001::no title+Daubechies, I.+Ten Lectures on Wavelets+1992::Uncertainty principles and ideal atomic decomposition+Donoho, DL; Huo, XM+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY+NOV 2001::no title+Frazier, MW.+An introduction to wavelets through linear algebra+1999::ASYMPTOTICALLY OPTIMAL DIFFERENCE-BASED ESTIMATION OF VARIANCE IN NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION+HALL, P; KAY, JW; TITTERINGTON, DM+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1990::Local polynomial estimators of the volatility function in nonparametric autoregression+Hardle, W; Tsybakov, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1997::MATCHING PURSUITS WITH TIME-FREQUENCY DICTIONARIES+MALLAT, SG; ZHANG, ZF+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING+DEC 1993::MULTIRESOLUTION APPROXIMATIONS AND WAVELET ORTHONORMAL BASES OF L2(R)+MALLAT, SG+TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY+SEP 1989::ESTIMATION OF HETEROSCEDASTICITY IN REGRESSION-ANALYSIS+MULLER, HG; STADTMULLER, U+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1987::Estimation of Variance Function in Heteroscedastic Regression Models by Generalized Coiflets+Palanisamy, Thangavel; Ravichandran, Joghee+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+NOV 26 2014::Estimation of the Variance Function in Heteroscedastic Linear Regression Models+Shen, Silian; Mei, Changlin+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2009"
Experimental designs in triangular simultaneous equations models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0581-y,MAY 2015,13,1,"Optimal experimental designs are considered for models with simultaneous equations. In particular, a model with two equations is assumed where one of the explanatory variables (exogenous) of the first equation is then the response variable (endogenous) of the second equation. In both equations there is a control variable, which is being designed through the celebrated D-optimality criterion. This work is based on a more restricted approach using just the first equation and assuming the distribution of the exogenous/endogenous variable completely known. Then a conditionally restricted optimal design was computed afterwards. In this paper the conditional model is assumed partially known but it has to be fitted as well. Although both approaches identify different prior knowledge a comparison of the optimal designs for both approaches is made. Since the model is not linear in the usual sense the optimal designs will depend on the parameters and a sensitivity analysis against its choice is performed.","Approximate design,Information matrix,D-optimal design,Simultaneous equations,Conditionally restricted design,Structural equations",,"Casero-Alonso, Victor@Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Math, Inst Math Appl Sci & Engn, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain::Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Math, Inst Math Appl Sci & Engn, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain","Casero-Alonso, Victor@Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha::Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha","Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus@A-2412-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7502-8188::Casero Alonso, Victor Manuel@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8165-5858","A brief introduction to the methodology of optimal experimental design+Aigner, D.J.+Journal of Economics+1979::OPTIMAL EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN FOR ERROR-COMPONENTS MODELS+AIGNER, DJ; BALESTRA, P+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1988::Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricists Companion+Angrist, JD; Pischke, JS+MOSTLY HARMLESS ECONOMETRICS: AN EMPIRICISTS COMPANION+2009::no title+Atkinson, A.; Donev, A.; Tobias, R.+Optimum Experimental Designs, with SAS+2007::Compound designs for dose-finding in the presence of nondesignable covariates+Biswas, Atanu; Lopez-Fidalgo, Jesus+PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS+MAR-APR 2013::no title+CONLISK J+J ECON+1979::An overview of design of experiments+Draper, NR; Pukelsheim, F+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAR 1996::Adaptive Experimental Design Using the Propensity Score+Hahn, Jinyong; Hirano, Keisuke; Karlan, Dean+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JAN 2011::An Efficient Algorithm for Constructing Bayesian Optimal Choice Designs+Kessels, Roselinde; Jones, Bradley; Goos, Peter; et al.+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+APR 2009::GENERAL EQUIVALENCE THEORY FOR OPTIMUM DESIGNS (APPROXIMATE THEORY)+KIEFER, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::Optimal experimental designs when some independent variables are not subject to control+Lopez-Fidalgo, J; Garcet-Rodriguez, SA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2004::Construction of marginally and conditionally restricted designs using multiplicative algorithms+Martin-Martin, R.; Torsney, B.; Lopez-Fidalgo, J.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 15 2007::no title+Pazman,, A.+Foundations of Optimum Experimental Design.+1986"

The new class results from a variance-mean mixture of the skew normal and the generalized inverse Gaussian distributions. The new class is very flexible in terms of heavy tails and skewness and many of the widely used distributions, such as generalized hyperbolic, skew t, and skew Laplace distributions are included as special or limiting cases of the new class. An explicit expression for the density function of the new class is given and some of its distributional properties, such as moment generating function, linear transformations, quadratic forms, marginal and conditional distributions are examined. We give a simulation algorithm to generate random variates from the new class and propose an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of its parameters.

It is shown analytically that the general family of shrinkage estimators is dominated by its positive-part variant in terms of MSE whenever there exists the positive-part variant or, in other words, the shrinkage factor can be negative for some parameter and data values.","Pre-test,Shrinkage estimator,Positive-part estimator,Mean squared error,Dominance","K-CLASS ESTIMATOR,PERFORMANCE,MODEL,RULE","Namba, Akio@Kobe Univ Rokko, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan","Namba, Akio@Kobe University",not exist,"A FAMILY OF MINIMAX ESTIMATORS OF MEAN OF A MULTIVARIATE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION+BARANCHI.AJ+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1970::STEINS ESTIMATION RULE AND ITS COMPETITORS - EMPIRICAL BAYES APPROACH+EFRON, B; MORRIS, C+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1973::COMBINING POSSIBLY RELATED ESTIMATION PROBLEMS+EFRON, B; MORRIS, C+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1973::no title+GOLDSTEIN M+HDB INT EC+1985::Estimation with quadratic loss+James, W.; Stein, C.+P 4 BERK S MATH STAT+1961::no title+Judge, GG; Bock, ME.+The statistical implications of pre-test and Stein-rule estimators in econometrics+1978::no title+Judge, GG; Yancey, TA.+IMPROVED METHODS INF+1986::no title+NAMBA A+STAT TEXTB MONOG+2002::On the use of the Stein variance estimator in the double k-class estimator when each individual regression coefficient is estimated+Namba, A+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JAN 2003::PMSE dominance of the positive-part shrinkage estimator in a regression model when relevant regressors are omitted+Namba, A+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUL 15 2003::Risk performance of a pre-test ridge regression estimator under the LINEX loss function when each individual regression coefficient is estimated+Namba, Akio; Ohtani, Kazuhiro+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2010::DOMINANCE OF THE POSITIVE-PART VERSION OF THE JAMES STEIN ESTIMATOR+NICKERSON, DM+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+SEP 1988::The exact general formulae for the moments and the MSE dominance of the Stein-rule and positive-part Stein-rule estimators+Ohtani, K; Kozumi, H+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 1996::Minimum mean squared error estimation of each individual coefficient in a linear regression model+Ohtani, K+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 15 1997::PRECISION OF INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATORS IN SIMULTANEOUS ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS+RAO, CR; SHINOZAKI, N+BIOMETRIKA+1978::Inadmissibility of the usual es-timator for the mean of a multivariate normal distribution+Stein, Charles.+P 3 BERK S MATH STAT+1956::Small sample properties of a ridge regression estimator when there exist omitted variables+Uemukai, Ryo+STATISTICAL PAPERS+NOV 2011::no title+ULLAH A+J ECONOMETRICS+1974"
Highly resistant gradient descent algorithm for computing intrinsic mean shape on similarity shape spaces,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0587-5,MAY 2015,35,0,"Among many algorithms, gradient descent algorithm (GDA) is a simple tool to derive an optimal quantity in dealing with an optimization problem in the linear space. Apart from the initial value, the step size has a great impact on the convergence rate of this algorithm. Its affect on the geometric structure of the consecutive configurations is more crucial if one works with an optimization problem in the statistical shape analysis. In other words, if the step size of the GDA is not properly tuned, the geometry might not be preserved while the algorithm is moving forward to reach an optimal mean shape. In order to improve the performance of the GDA, we introduce a dynamic step size and a new criterion both to check the geometry in each step of the algorithm and to accelerate the convergence rate. These lead to a new robust algorithm on deriving the intrinsic mean on the shape space. We compare the performance of our proposed procedure to the usual GDA using a real shape data accompanied with simulation studies.","Shape space,Non-Euclidean statistics,Intrinsic mean shape,Robust gradient descent algorithm,Step size","PRINCIPAL GEODESIC ANALYSIS,EXTRINSIC SAMPLE MEANS,CENTER-OF-MASS,MANIFOLDS,STATISTICS,ADAPTATION","Fotouhi, H.@Tarbiat Modares Univ, Tehran, Iran::Golalizadeh, M.@Tarbiat Modares Univ, Tehran, Iran","Fotouhi, H.@Tarbiat Modares University::Golalizadeh, M.@Tarbiat Modares University",not exist,"ON THE OPTIMUM GAIN PARAMETER IN LMS ADAPTATION+BERSHAD, NJ+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ACOUSTICS SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING+JUL 1987::Large sample theory of intrinsic and extrinsic sample means on manifolds - II+Bhattacharya, R; Patrangenaru, V+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2005::Large sample theory of intrinsic and extrinsic sample means on manifolds.

Empirical likelihood based modal regression,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0588-4,MAY 2015,22,2,"In this paper, we consider how to yield a robust empirical likelihood estimation for regression models. After introducing modal regression, we propose a novel empirical likelihood method based on modal regression estimation equations, which has the merits of both robustness and high inference efficiency compared with the least square based methods. Under some mild conditions, we show that Wilks' theorem of the proposed empirical likelihood approach continues to hold. Advantages of empirical likelihood modal regression as a nonparametric approach are illustrated by constructing confidence intervals/regions.

Modelling long-range dependence and trends in duration series: an approach based on EFARIMA and ESEMIFAR models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0590-x,MAY 2015,51,0,"Duration series often exhibit long-range dependence and local nonstationarities. Here, exponential FARIMA (EFARIMA) and exponential SEMIFAR (ESEMIFAR) models are introduced. These models capture simultaneously nonstationarities in the mean as well as short- and long-range dependence, while avoiding the complication of unobservable latent processes. The models can be thought of as locally stationary long-memory extensions of exponential ACD models. Statistical properties of the models are derived. In particular the long-memory parameter in the original and the log-transformed process is the same. For Gaussian innovations, exact explicit formulas for all moments and autocovariances are given, and the unconditional distribution is log-normal. Estimation and model selection can be carried out with standard software. The approach is illustrated by an application to average daily transaction durations.","Long-memory MEM model,Exponential FARIMA,Exponential ACD,Exponential SEMIFAR,Nonparametric scale function,Average durations","AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL DURATION,REALIZED VOLATILITY,TIME-SERIES,MEMORY,HETEROSKEDASTICITY,CONVERGENCE,PARAMETER,STATIONARY,REGRESSION,SELECTION","Beran, Jan@Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany::Feng, Yuanhua@Univ Paderborn, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany::Ghosh, Sucharita@Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Beran, Jan@University of Konstanz::Feng, Yuanhua@University of Paderborn::Ghosh, Sucharita@Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research",not exist,"Fractionally integrated generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity+Baillie, RT; Bollerslev, T; Mikkelsen, HO+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 1996::The logarithmic ACD model: an application to the bidask quote process of three NYSE stocks+Bauwens, L.; Giot, P.+Annal.

Improved estimators of the distribution function based on lower record values,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0591-9,MAY 2015,33,2,"In this paper, we define different types of estimators for the distribution function, namely preliminary test (PT), shrinkage PT (SPT), Stein type (S), and Thompson shrinkage (TS) estimators based on lower record observations and their inter record times. Their asymptotic distributional bias and mean square error are explicitly derived. The superiority conditions of the new proposed estimators over the existing estimator of distribution function are also obtained. It is shown that about the neighborhood of the null hypothesis , the PTE is superior to the SE in the sense of having higher asymptotic relative efficiency. Further for the reasonable values of the newly proposed SPT estimator uniformly dominates the non-parametric maximum like likelihood estimators in the literatures. A table is also given to be more specifics along the exhibited theoretical results for practical sake. Some graphical representations are given as proofs of our assertions. A simulation study is also carried out for some life time distribution, to examine the accuracy of the proposed estimators with a limited sample size. The results show that combination of the parametric and nonparametric estimators will give more efficient estimators. This study is finally concluded by applying the theoretic results to a real data set.","Asymptotic distributional mean square error,Asymptotic relative efficiency,Distribution function,Local alternative,Preliminary test estimator,Record values,Stein type estimator","SMOOTH NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION,FISHER INFORMATION,BREAKING DATA","Belaghi, R.

We embrace a multivariate structural model with known diagonal covariance error matrices, which is a common setup when different measurement methods are compared. Maximum likelihood estimates are computed numerically via the EM algorithm. Consistent estimation of the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimators and a graphical device for model checking are also discussed. Test statistics are proposed for testing hypotheses of interest with the asymptotic chi-square distribution which guarantees correct asymptotic significance levels. Results of simulations comprising point estimation, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing are reported. An application to a real data set is given. Up to best of our knowledge, topics such as model checking and hypotheses testing have received only scarce attention in the literature on calibration models.","EM algorithm,Calibration,Estimation,Hypotheses testing,Maximum likelihood,Measurement error models,Structural models","HETEROSCEDASTIC MEASUREMENT ERRORS,ANALYTICAL BIAS,REGRESSION,VARIABLES","de Castro, Mario@Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Ciencias Matemat & Comp, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil::Galea, Manuel@Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile","de Castro, Mario@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Galea, Manuel@Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","de Castro, Mario@E-2564-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8685-9470::Inst Cien Matematicas Computacao, ICMC/USP@D-8320-2017","no title+Atkinson, A.

The selection of the biasing parameters are given so as to minimize the cross-validation methods. An example is given which illustrates the comprehensive predictive assessment of various estimators and shows the usefullness of computing. Besides, the performance of the estimators under several different conditions is examined via a simulation study. The results displayed that the biased estimator versions and the restricted form of the biased estimator versions of cross-validation methods give better predictive performance in the presence of multicollinearity.","Ridge estimator,Liu estimator,Two parameter estimator,Linear restrictions,Cross-validation,Prediction","BIASING PARAMETER,BIASED-ESTIMATION,RIDGE REGRESSION,CRITERION,VALIDATION,ESTIMATORS,VARIABLES,SELECTION,SQUARES,ERROR","Ozkale, M.

Six test statistics, one based on the ratio of the difference of largest observation and the sample mean which are unsuspected to be outliers to the range of these observations, and others used for block test procedures discussed in Basu (J Am Stat Assoc 60:548-559, 1965), Balasooriya and Gadag (J Stat Comput Simul 50:249-259, 1994), Zerbet and Nikulin (Commun Stat Theory Methods 32:573-583, 2003) and Kumar (Testing for suspected observations in an exponential sample with unknown origin, 2013), are considered. Utilizing the recursion of Huffer (J Appl Probab 25:346-354, 1988) and algorithm of Lin and Balakrishnan (Comput Stat Data Anal 53:3281-3290, 2009), the critical values of the joint null distributions of these test statistics for sequential testing discordancy of upper outliers in two-parameter exponential samples on the important cases and are obtained.

Numerical results are presented in order to illustrate our method while a practical guidance for the determination of a good start-up demonstration test is also given.

Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov fuzzy test for fuzzy random variables,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0566-2,FEB 2015,55,6,"In this paper, a new method is proposed for developing two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the case when the data are observations of fuzzy random variables, and the hypotheses are imprecise rather than crisp. In this approach, first a new notion of fuzzy random variables is introduced. Then, the -pessimistic values of the imprecise observations are transacted to extend the usual method of two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To do this, the concepts of fuzzy cumulative distribution function and fuzzy empirical cumulative distribution function are defined. We also develop a well-known large sample property of the classical empirical cumulative distribution function for fuzzy empirical cumulative distribution function. In addition, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test statistic is extended for fuzzy random variables. After that, the method of computing the so-called fuzzy value is introduced to evaluate the imprecise hypotheses of interest. In this regard, applying an index called credibility degree, the obtained fuzzy value and the crisp significance level are compared. The result provides a fuzzy test function which leads to some degrees to accept or to reject the null hypothesis. Some numerical examples are provided throughout the paper clarifying the discussions made in this paper.","Credibility degree,Fuzzy p value,Fuzzy (empirical) cumulative distribution function,Fuzzy random variable,Fuzzy test function","LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL,STATISTICAL-INFERENCE,EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS,VAGUE DATA,CLASSIFICATION","Hesamian, Gholamreza@Payame Noor Univ, Dept Stat, Tehran 193953697, Iran::Chachi, Jalal@Semnan Univ, Dept Math Stat & Comp Sci, Semnan 35195363, Iran","Hesamian, Gholamreza@Payame Noor University::Chachi, Jalal@Semnan University",not exist,"Fuzzy rule-based models for decision support in ecosystem management+Adriaenssens, V; De Baets, B; Goethals, PLM; et al.+SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT+FEB 5 2004::Overview on the development of fuzzy random variables+Angeles Gil, Maria; Lopez-Diaz, Miguel; Ralescu, Dan A.+FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS+OCT 1 2006::no title+Bandemer, H; Nather, W.+Fuzzy data analysis+1992::no title+BERTOLUZZA C+STAT MODELING ANAL M+2002::no title+Bethea, R.

Canonical models of different degrees and also other models have been suggested to represent the mean response. Optimum designs for estimation of the parameters of the models have been investigated by different authors. In most cases, the optimum design includes the vertex points of the simplex as support points of the design, which are not mixture combinations in the true non-trivial sense.

The cost and time required for many industrial experimentations can be reduced by using the class of supersaturated designs, since the main goal for such a design is to identify only a few of the factors under consideration that have dominant effects and to do this identification at a minimal cost. While most of the literature on supersaturated designs has focused on the construction of designs and their optimality properties, the data analysis of such designs has not been developed to a great extent. In this paper, we propose a supersaturated design analysis method, by assuming generalized linear models for discrete responses, for analyzing main effects designs and identifying simultaneously the effects that are significant. Empirical study demonstrates that this method performs well with low Type I and Type II error rates. The proposed method is therefore useful as it enables us to use supersaturated designs for analyzing data on discrete response regression models.","Entropy,Error rates,Factor screening,Discrete response regression models,Information gain,Symmetrical uncertainty","MUTUAL INFORMATION,MATHEMATICAL-THEORY,FEATURE-SELECTION,DANTZIG SELECTOR,COMMUNICATION,REDUNDANCY,STRATEGY","Balakrishnan, N.@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada::Koukouvinos, C.@Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Math, Athens 15773, Zografou, Greece::Parpoula, C.@Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Math, Athens 15773, Zografou, Greece","Balakrishnan, N.@McMaster University::Koukouvinos, C.@National Technical University of Athens::Parpoula, C.@National Technical University of Athens",not exist,"Some risks in the construction and analysis of supersaturated designs+Abraham, B; Chipman, H; Vijayan, K+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1999::no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical Data Analysis+2002::An information theoretical algorithm for analyzing supersaturated designs for a binary response+Balakrishnan, N.; Koukouvinos, C.; Parpoula, C.+METRIKA+JAN 2013::A two-stage Bayesian model selection strategy for supersaturated designs+Beattie, SD; Fong, DKH; Lin, DKJ+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 2002::AN ANALYSIS FOR UNREPLICATED FRACTIONAL FACTORIALS+BOX, GEP; MEYER, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::The Dantzig selector: Statistical estimation when p is much larger than n+Candes, Emmanuel; Tao, Terence+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2007::A Bayesian variable-selection approach for analyzing designed experiments with complex aliasing+Chipman, H; Hamada, M; Wu, CFJ+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1997::Choosing the link function and accounting for link uncertainty in generalized linear models using Bayes factors+Czado, C; Raftery, AE+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 2006::An overview of design of experiments+Draper, NR; Pukelsheim, F+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAR 1996::Zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models using the COUNTREG Procedure+Erdman, D; Jackson, L; Sinko, A.+Paper 322-2008+2008::Fast binary feature selection with conditional mutual information+Fleuret, F+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+NOV 2004::ANALYSIS OF DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS WITH COMPLEX ALIASING+HAMADA, M; WU, CFJ+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1992::no title+Hilbe, J.+Negative binomial regression+2008::Analysis of supersaturated designs+Holcomb, DR; Montgomery, DC; Carlyle, WM+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 2003::Mutual information and redundancy for categorical data+Hong, Chong Sun; Kim, Beom Jun+STATISTICAL PAPERS+FEB 2011::Analyzing Supersaturated Designs by Means of an Information Based Criterion+Koukouvinos, C.; Parpoula, C.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION+2012::E(s(2))-optimal and minimax-optimal cyclic supersaturated designs via multi-objective simulated annealing+Koukouvinos, Christos; Mylona, Kalliopi; Simos, Dimitris E.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 2008::Data analysis in supersaturated designs+Li, RZ; Lin, DKJ+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+SEP 1 2002::GENERATING SYSTEMATIC SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS+LIN, DKJ+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1995::A NEW CLASS OF SUPERSATURATED DESIGNS+LIN, DKJ+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1993::A strategy of searching active factors in supersaturated screening experiments+Lu, X; Wu, X+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+OCT 2004::A comparison of design and model selection methods for supersaturated experiments+Marley, Christopher J.; Woods, David C.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+DEC 1 2010::no title+Mc Cullagh, P.; Nelder, J.

The estimation and inference on the equal ratios of means to standard deviations of normal populations,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0572-4,FEB 2015,3,0,This paper considers the estimation and the hypothesis testing on the equality of the ratios of the means to standard deviations of several normal populations with difference sample sizes. We propose an iterative algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the normal population means and standard deviations when the ratios of the means to the standard deviations are equal. A bootstrap method is introduced to determine the critical value in the likelihood ratio test. The simulation studies indicate that the proposed hypothesis testing performs well.,"Equal restriction,Likelihood ratio test,Maximum likelihood estimate,Normal population",GENERALIZED P-VALUES,"Li, Shuyou@Liaoning Univ Technol, Fac Sci, Jinzhou 121001, Liaoning, Peoples R China::Lu, Xu@Liaoning Univ Technol, Fac Sci, Jinzhou 121001, Liaoning, Peoples R China::Mi, Ying@Liaoning Univ Technol, Fac Sci, Jinzhou 121001, Liaoning, Peoples R China::Liu, Wei@York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","Li, Shuyou@Liaoning University of Technology::Lu, Xu@Liaoning University of Technology::Mi, Ying@Liaoning University of Technology::Liu, Wei@York University - Canada",not exist,"A LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST FOR THE EQUALITY OF PROPORTIONS OF 2 NORMAL-POPULATIONS+CHOU, YM; OWEN, DB+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1991::GENERALIZED P-VALUES IN SIGNIFICANCE TESTING OF HYPOTHESES IN THE PRESENCE OF NUISANCE PARAMETERS+TSUI, KW; WEERAHANDI, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1989::TESTING VARIANCE-COMPONENTS IN MIXED MODELS WITH GENERALIZED P-VALUES+WEERAHANDI, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1991"
Using prior information in privacy-protecting survey designs for categorical sensitive variables,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0573-3,FEB 2015,38,3,"To gather data on sensitive characteristics, such as annual income, tax evasion, insurance fraud or students' cheating behavior, direct questioning is problematic, because it often results in answer refusal or untruthful responses. For this reason, several randomized response (RR) and nonrandomized response (NRR) survey designs, which increase cooperation by protecting the respondents' privacy, have been proposed in the literature. In the first part of this paper, we present a Bayesian extension of a recently published, innovative NRR method for multichotomous sensitive variables. With this extension, the investigator is able to incorporate prior information on the parameter, e.g., based on a previous study, into the estimation and to improve the estimation precision. In particular, we derive different point and interval estimates by the EM algorithm and data augmentation. The performance of the considered estimators is evaluated in a simulation study. In the second part of this article, we show that for any RR or NRR model addressing the estimation of the distribution of a categorical sensitive characteristic, the design matrices of the model play the central role for the Bayes estimation whereas the concrete answer scheme is irrelevant. This observation enables us to widely generalize the calculations from the first part and to establish a common approach for Bayes inference in RR and NRR designs for categorical sensitive variables. This unified approach covers even multi-stage models and models that require more than one sample.","Randomized response,Nonrandomized response,Bayesian estimation,EM algorithm,Data augmentation","RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE MODEL,EM ALGORITHM,QUESTIONS","Groenitz, Heiko@Univ Marburg, Dept Stat, Fac 02, D-35032 Marburg, Germany","Groenitz, Heiko@Philipps University Marburg",not exist,"A multi-proportions randomized response model+Abul-Ela, A.

Then we give detailed comparisons between those estimators that can be derived from the PCTP estimator such as the generalized least squares estimator, the principal components regression estimator, the estimator and the estimator by the mean squared error (MSE) matrix criterion. Also, we obtain the conditions for the superiority of one estimator over the other.

Performance of Kibria's methods in partial linear ridge regression model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-014-0578-6,FEB 2015,35,13,"This paper considers several estimators for estimating the biasing parameter in the study of partial linear models in the presence of multicollinearity. After exhibiting the MSE of ridge estimator based on eigenvalues of design matrix, a simulation study has been conducted to compare the performanceof the estimators. Based on the simulation studywe found that, increasing the correlation between the independent variables has positive effect on the MSE (signal-to-noise-ratio). However, increasingthe value of has negative effect on MSE. When the sample size increases the MSE decreases even when the correlation between the independentvariables is large. An application of the proposed model is considered forhousing attributes to illustrate the performance ofdifferent estimators.","Eigenvalues,Geometric-harmonic mean,MSE,Partial linear model,Ridge regression","LIU-TYPE ESTIMATOR,PARAMETERS,SIMULATION,EFFICIENCY","Arashi, M.@Shahrood Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Dept Stat, Shahrood, Iran::Valizadeh, T.@Shahrood Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Dept Stat, Shahrood, Iran","Arashi, M.@Shahrood University of Technology::Valizadeh, T.@Shahrood University of Technology","Arashi, Mohammad@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5881-9241","Liu-type estimator in semiparametric regression model+Akdeniz, Akdeniz F; Duran, E.+J Stat Comput Simul+2009::Mean squared error matrix comparisons of some biased estimators in linear regression+Akdeniz, F; Erol, H+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2003::ON THE ALMOST UNBIASED GENERALIZED LIU ESTIMATOR UNBIASED ESTIMATION OF THE BIAS AND MSE+AKDENIZ, F; KACIRANLAR, S+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::Restricted Ridge Estimators of the Parameters in Semiparametric Regression Model+Akdeniz, Fikri; Tabakan, Guelin+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2009::Efficiency of a Liu-type estimator in semiparametric regression models+Duran, Esra Akdeniz; Akdeniz, Fikri; Hu, Hongchang+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS+JAN 1 2011::Efficiency of the modified jackknifed Liu-type estimator+Duran, Esra Akdeniz; Akdeniz, Fikri+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAY 2012::SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATES OF THE RELATION BETWEEN WEATHER AND ELECTRICITY SALES+ENGLE, RF; GRANGER, CWJ; RICE, J; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+JUN 1986::Estimation in partially linear models+Eubank, RL; Kambour, EL; Kim, JT; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+NOV 28 1998::A SIMULATION STUDY OF SOME RIDGE ESTIMATORS+GIBBONS, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1981::Generalized additive models+Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R.+Stat Sci+1986::A class of biased estimator in linear restriction in linear regression model with non-normal disturbance+Hocking, R.

In this paper, we investigate the statistical performance of the VP control chart coupled with run rules. We consider two well-known run rules schemes. Statistical performance is evaluated by using a Markov chain modeling the random shock mechanism of the monitored process. The in-control time interval of the process is assumed to follow an exponential distribution. A genetic algorithm has been designed to select the optimal chart design parameters. We provide an extensive numerical analysis indicating that the VP control chart with run rules outperforms other charts for small sizes of the mean shift expressed through the Mahalanobis distance.","Hotelling's T-2 Control chart,Variable parameters (VP),Run rules,Markov chain,Genetic algorithms (GA)","ECONOMIC DESIGN,GENETIC ALGORITHMS,(X)OVER-BAR CHARTS,STATISTICAL DESIGN,SAMPLE-SIZE,R CHARTS","Faraz, Alireza@Univ Liege, HEC Management Sch, Liege, Belgium::Celano, Giovanni@Univ Catania, Dipartimento Ingn Ind, Catania, Italy::Saniga, Erwin@Univ Delaware, Dept Business Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA::Heuchenne, C.@Univ Liege, HEC Management Sch, Liege, Belgium::Fichera, S.@Univ Catania, Dipartimento Ingn Ind, Catania, Italy","Faraz, Alireza@University of Liege::Celano, Giovanni@University of Catania::Saniga, Erwin@University of Delaware::Heuchenne, C.@University of Liege::Fichera, S.@University of Catania","Celano, Giovanni@C-1052-2013@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7871-7499::Sergio, Fichera@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6940-6939::Faraz, Alireza@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1321-8215","A comparison of T-2 control charts with variable sampling schemes as opposed to MEWMA chart+Aparisi, F; Haro, CL+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+JUL 2003::Hotelling's T-2 control chart with variable sampling intervals+Aparisi, F; Haro, CL+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH+SEP 2001::A Performance analysis of Hotelling's X&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;control chart with supplementary runs rules+Aparisi, F; Champ, CW; Garcia-Diaz, JC.+Qual Eng+2004::Multiobjective economic design of an X control chart+Celano, G; Fichera, S+COMPUTERS &amp; INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING+OCT 1999::Statistical design of variable sample size and sampling interval (X)over-bar control charts with run rules+Celano, G; Costa, A; Fichera, S+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY+APR 2006::A PROGRAM TO EVALUATE THE RUN LENGTH DISTRIBUTION OF A SHEWHART CONTROL CHART WITH SUPPLEMENTARY RUNS RULES+CHAMP, CW; WOODALL, WH+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JAN 1990::Minimizing the cost of integrated systems approach to process control and maintenance model by EWMA control chart using genetic algorithm+Charongrattanasakul, P.; Pongpullponsak, A.+EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS+MAY 2011::Economic statistical design of non-uniform sampling scheme X bar control charts under non-normality and Gamma shock using genetic algorithm+Chen, F.

An extension of the generalized half-normal distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0546-6,NOV 2014,21,5,"In this paper we propose an extension of the generalized half-normal distribution studied in Cooray and Ananda (Commun Stat 37:1323-1337, 2008). This new distribution is defined by considering the quotient of two random variables, the one in the numerator being a generalized half normal distribution and the one in the denominator being a power of the uniform distribution on , respectively. The resulting distribution has greater kurtosis than the generalized half normal distribution. The density function of this more general distribution is derived jointly with some of its properties and moments. We discuss stochastic representation, maximum likelihood and moments estimation. Applications to real data sets are reported revealing that the proposed distribution can fit real data better than the slashed half-normal, generalized half-normal and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions.","Generalized half-normal distribution,Slash distribution,Slashed half-normal,Kurtosis","LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS,SLASH DISTRIBUTION,INFERENCE,FAMILY","Olmos, Neveka M.@Univ Antofagasta, Dept Matemat, Fac Ciencias Basicas, Antofagasta, Chile::Varela, Hector@Univ Antofagasta, Dept Matemat, Fac Ciencias Basicas, Antofagasta, Chile::Bolfarine, Heleno@Univ Sao Paulo, IME, Dept Estat, Sao Paulo, Brazil::Gomez, Hector W.@Univ Antofagasta, Dept Matemat, Fac Ciencias Basicas, Antofagasta, Chile","Olmos, Neveka M.@Universidad de Antofagasta::Varela, Hector@Universidad de Antofagasta::Bolfarine, Heleno@Universidade de Sao Paulo::Gomez, Hector W.@Universidad de Antofagasta","Gomez, Hector W.@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3726-5507","NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::no title+Andrews, D.

Distributions for spherical data based on nonnegative trigonometric sums,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0547-5,NOV 2014,29,1,"A family of distributions for a random pair of angles that determine a point on the surface of a three-dimensional unit sphere (three-dimensional directions) is proposed. It is based on the use of nonnegative double trigonometric (Fourier) sums (series). Using this family of distributions, data that possess rotational symmetry, asymmetry or one or more modes can be modeled. In addition, the joint trigonometric moments are expressed in terms of the model parameters. An efficient Newton-like optimization algorithm on manifolds is developed to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. The proposed family is applied to two real data sets studied previously in the literature. The first data set is related to the measurements of magnetic remanence in samples of Precambrian volcanics in Australia and the second to the arrival directions of low mu showers of cosmic rays.","Fourier series,Manifold,Multimodal distribution,Newton-like algorithm","PROBABILITY DENSITY,HYPERSPHERE,MODELS","Fernandez-Duran, J.

Divergence-based tests of homogeneity for spatial data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0554-6,NOV 2014,32,0,The problem of testing homogeneity in contingency tables when the data are spatially correlated is considered. We derive statistics defined as divergences between unrestricted and restricted estimated joint cell probabilities and we show that they are asymptotically distributed as linear combinations of chi-square random variables under the null hypothesis of homogeneity. Monte Carlo simulation experiments are carried out to investigate the behavior of the new divergence test statistics and to make comparisons with the statistics that do not take into account the spatial correlation. We show that some of the introduced divergence test statistics have a significantly better behavior than the classical chi-square test for the problem under consideration when we compare them on the basis of the simulated sizes and powers.,"Test of homogeneity,Divergence statistics,Chi-square statistic,Spatial data","MARGINAL HOMOGENEITY,CONTINGENCY-TABLES,TEST STATISTICS,INDEPENDENCE,POPULATIONS,CONSTRAINTS,HYPOTHESES,ESTIMATOR","Hobza, Tomas@Czech Tech Univ, Dept Math, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic::Morales, Domingo@Miguel Hernandez Univ Elche, Ctr Operat Res, Elche, Spain::Pardo, Leandro@Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Madrid, Spain","Hobza, Tomas@Czech Technical University Prague::Morales, Domingo@Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche::Pardo, Leandro@Complutense University of Madrid","Hobza, Tomas@A-1691-2016::Pardo, Leandro@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2005-8245","A GENERAL CLASS OF COEFFICIENTS OF DIVERGENCE OF 1 DISTRIBUTION FROM ANOTHER+ALI, SM; SILVEY, SD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1966::no title+Basu, A.; Shioya, H.; Park, C.+Statistical Inference: The Minimum Distance Approach+2011::no title+Bhatia, R.+Matrix Analysis+1997::Testing mutual independence between two discrete-valued spatial processes: A correction to Pearson chi-squared+Cerioli, A+BIOMETRICS+DEC 2002::Tests of homogeneity for spatial populations+Cerioli, A+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 1 2002::no title+Cressie, N.+Statistics for Spatial Data+1993::Eine informationstheoretische ungleichung und ihre anwendung auf den Bewis der Ergodizitat on Markhoffschen Ketten+Csiszar, I.+Publications of the Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences+1963::Spatial Autocorrelation and Statistical Tests: Some Solutions+Dale, Mark R.

Depth functions as measures of representativeness,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0555-5,NOV 2014,31,1,"Data depth provides a natural means to rank multivariate vectors with respect to an underlying multivariate distribution. Most existing depth functions emphasize a centre-outward ordering of data points, which may not provide a useful geometric representation of certain distributional features, such as multimodality, of concern to some statistical applications. Such inadequacy motivates us to develop a device for ranking data points according to their ""representativeness"" rather than ""centrality"" with respect to an underlying distribution of interest. Derived essentially from a choice of goodness-of-fit test statistic, our device calls for a new interpretation of ""depth"" more akin to the concept of density than location. It copes particularly well with multivariate data exhibiting multimodality. In addition to providing depth values for individual data points, depth functions derived from goodness-of-fit tests also extend naturally to provide depth values for subsets of data points, a concept new to the data-depth literature.","Centre-outward ordering,Data depth,Goodness-of-fit tests,Multimodality,Representativeness","MULTIVARIATE 2-SAMPLE TEST,KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TESTS,OF-FIT TESTS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Dong, Ye@Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China::Lee, Stephen M.

This paper revisits the recently considered issue of testing for radial symmetry. Three rank-based statistics are proposed to this end which are asymptotically equivalent but simpler to compute than those of Bouzebda and Cherfi (J Stat Plan Inference 142:1262-1271, 2012). Their limiting null distribution and its approximation using the multiplier bootstrap are discussed. The finite-sample properties of the resulting tests are assessed via simulations. The asymptotic distribution of one of the test statistics is also computed under an arbitrary alternative, thereby correcting an error in the recent work of Dehgani et al.

The pgf of joint distribution of is obtained in terms of matrix polynomial and an algorithm is developed to get exact probability distribution. Numerical results are included to demonstrate the computational flexibility of the developed results. Various applications of the joint distribution of such as in evaluation of the reliability of and system, in evaluation of quantities related to start-up demonstration tests, acceptance sampling plans are also discussed.","Runs,Method of conditional pgfs,Matrix polynomial,Algorithm","DEPENDENT MULTISTATE TRIALS,WAITING TIME PROBLEMS,2-STATE MARKOV-CHAIN,BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTIONS,ORDER-K,SPECIFIED LENGTHS,SYSTEMS,NUMBERS,RELIABILITIES,RECURSIONS","Kamalja, Kirtee K.@North Maharashtra Univ, Dept Stat, Sch Math Sci, Jalgaon, India","Kamalja, Kirtee K.@North Maharashtra University",not exist,"Numbers of success-runs of specified length until certain stopping time rules and generalized binomial distributions of order k+Aki, S; Hirano, K+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+DEC 2000::Start-up demonstration tests with rejection of units upon observing d failures+Balakrishnan, N; Chan, PS+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 2000::no title+BALAKRISHNAN N+MATH SCI+1993::SOONER AND LATER WAITING TIME PROBLEMS FOR MARKOVIAN BERNOULLI TRIALS+BALASUBRAMANIAN, K; VIVEROS, R; BALAKRISHNAN, N+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+SEP 22 1993::Reliabilities for (n,f,k) systems+Chang, GJ; Cui, LR; Hwang, FK+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUL 1 1999::On the dual reliability systems of (n, f, k) and &lt; n, f, k &gt;+Cui, LR; Kuo, W; Li, JL; et al.+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 1 2006::no title+Feller, W.+An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications+1968::Formulae and recursions for the joint distribution of success runs of several lengths+Godbole, AP; Papastavridis, SG; Weishaar, RS+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1997::Reliabilities for (n, f, k(i, h)) and [n, f, k(i, j)] systems+Guo, Yanlan; Cui, Lirong; Li, Jinlin; et al.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2006::Waiting time problems in a two-state Markov chain+Han, Q; Aki, S+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+DEC 2000::Joint distributions of runs in a sequence of multi-state trials+Han, Q; Aki, S+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 1999::Formulae and recursions for the joint distributions of success runs of several lengths in a two-state Markov chain+Han, Q; Aki, S+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+OCT 15 1998::On number of occurrences of success runs of specified length in a two-state Markov chain+Hirano, H; Aki, S.+Stat Sin+1993::Joint distributions of numbers of success runs of specified lengths in linear and circular sequences+Inoue, K; Aki, S+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+JUN 2005::Generalized binomial and negative binomial distributions of order k by the l-overlapping enumeration scheme+Inoue, K; Aki, S+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 2003::Joint distributions of numbers of runs of specified lengths in a sequence of Markov dependent multistate trials+Inoue, Kiyoshi; Aki, Sigeo+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+SEP 2007::On the joint distribution of runs and patterns in a sequence of Markov dependent bivariate trials.+Kamalja, KK; Shinde, RL.+Am Open J Stat+2011::On the reliability of (n, f, k) and &amp;LT;n, f, k&amp;GT; systems+Kamalja, KK; Shinde, RL.+Commun Stat Theory Methods+2013::Birnbaum reliability importance for (n, f, k) and &amp;LT;n, f, k&amp;GT; system+Kamalja, KK.+Commun Stati Theory Methods+2013::Run and frequency quotas in a multi-state Markov chain+Kolev, N; Minkova, L+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1999::Joint distributions of runs in a sequence of higher-order two-state Markov trials+Kotwal, K.

Selection of tuning parameters in bridge regression models via Bayesian information criterion,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0561-7,NOV 2014,35,6,"We consider bridge regression models, which can produce a sparse or non-sparse model by controlling a tuning parameter in the penalty term. A crucial part of a model building strategy is the selection of the values for adjusted parameters, such as regularization and tuning parameters. Indeed, this can be viewed as a problem in selecting and evaluating the model. We propose a Bayesian selection criterion for evaluating bridge regression models. This criterion enables us to objectively select the values of the adjusted parameters. We investigate the effectiveness of our proposed modeling strategy with some numerical examples.","Bridge penalty,Model selection,Penalized maximum likelihood method,Sparse regression","NONCONCAVE PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD,VARIABLE SELECTION,LASSO,ESTIMATORS,PENALTIES","Kawano, Shuichi@Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Math Sci, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan","Kawano, Shuichi@Osaka Prefecture University",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Penalized estimation in additive varying coefficient models using grouped regularization+Antoniadis, A.; Gijbels, I.; Lambert-Lacroix, S.+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2014::Penalized likelihood regression for generalized linear models with non-quadratic penalties+Antoniadis, Anestis; Gijbels, Irene; Nikolova, Mila+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+JUN 2011::Variational bridge regression+Armagan, A.+P 12 INT C ART INT S+2009::Statistics for High-Dimensional Data: Methods, Theory and Applications+Buehlmann, Peter; van de Geer, Sara+STATISTICS FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA: METHODS, THEORY AND APPLICATIONS+2011::SMOOTHING NOISY DATA WITH SPLINE FUNCTIONS - ESTIMATING THE CORRECT DEGREE OF SMOOTHING BY THE METHOD OF GENERALIZED CROSS-VALIDATION+CRAVEN, P; WAHBA, G+NUMERISCHE MATHEMATIK+1979::Flexible smoothing with B-splines and penalties+Eilers, PHC; Marx, BD+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+MAY 1996::Sure independence screening for ultrahigh dimensional feature space+Fan, Jianqing; Lv, Jinchi+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+NOV 2008::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::A statistical view of some chemometrics regression tools+Frank, JE; Friedman, JH.+Technometrics+1993::Penalized regressions: The bridge versus the lasso+Fu, WJJ+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 1998::no title+Hastie, T.

Finite mixture modeling of censored regression models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0509-y,AUG 2014,33,3,A finite mixture of Tobit models is suggested for estimation of regression models with a censored response variable. A mixture of models is not primarily adapted due to a true component structure in the population; the flexibility of the mixture is suggested as a way of avoiding non-robust parametrically specified models. The new estimator has several interesting features. One is its potential to yield valid estimates in cases with a high degree of censoring. The estimator is in a Monte Carlo simulation compared with earlier suggestions of estimators based on semi-parametric censored regression models.

Spatial robust small area estimation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0517-y,AUG 2014,47,4,"The accuracy of recent applications in small area statistics in many cases highly depends on the assumed properties of the underlying models and the availability of micro information. In finite population sampling, small sample sizes may increase the sensitivity of the modeling with respect to single units. In these cases, area-specific sample sizes tend to be small such that normal assumptions, even of area means, seem to be violated. Hence, applying robust estimation methods is expected to yield more reliable results. In general, two robust small area methods are applied, the robust EBLUP and the M-quantile method. Additionally, the use of adequate auxiliary information may further increase the accuracy of the estimates. In prediction based approaches where information is needed on universe level, in general, only few variables are available which can be used for modeling. In addition to variables from the dataset, in many cases further information may be available, e.g. geographical information which could indicate spatial dependencies between neighboring areas. This spatial information can be included in the modeling using spatially correlated area effects. Within the paper the classical robust EBLUP is extended to cover spatial area effects via a simultaneous autoregressive model. The performance of the different estimators are compared in a model-based simulation study.","Small area estimation,M-quantile,Robust EBLUP,Spatial correlation","M-QUANTILE MODELS,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,PREDICTION,EBLUP,BOOTSTRAP,COMPONENTS,REGRESSION,ERROR,MSE","Schmid, Timo@Free Univ Berlin, Inst Stat & Econometr, D-14195 Berlin, Germany::Muennich, Ralf T.@Univ Trier, Econ & Social Stat Dept, D-54286 Trier, Germany","Schmid, Timo@Free University of Berlin::Muennich, Ralf T.@Universitat Trier",not exist,"Quantile smoothing in financial time series+Abberger, K+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 1997::no title+Anselin, L.+Spatial Econometrics: Method and Models+1992::no title+Banerjee, Sudipto; Carlin, Bradley P; Gelfand, Alan E.+Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data+2004::AN ERROR-COMPONENTS MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF COUNTY CROP AREAS USING SURVEY AND SATELLITE DATA+BATTESE, GE; HARTER, RM; FULLER, WA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1988::SPATIAL INTERACTION AND STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS OF LATTICE SYSTEMS+BESAG, J+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::M-QUANTILES+BRECKLING, J; CHAMBERS, R+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 1988::M-quantile models for small area estimation+Chambers, Ray; Tzavidis, Nikos+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 2006::Outlier robust small area estimation+Chambers, Ray; Chandra, Hukum; Salvati, Nicola; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+JAN 2014::A Random Effect Block Bootstrap for Clustered Data+Chambers, Raymond; Chandra, Hukum+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+JUN 2013::OUTLIER ROBUST FINITE POPULATION ESTIMATION+CHAMBERS, RL+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1986::Parametric bootstrap approximation to the distribution of EBLUP and related prediction intervals in linear mixed models+Chatterjee, Snigdhansu; Lahiri, Partha; Li, Huilin+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2008::no title+Cressie, N.+Statistics for Spatial Data+1993::The 50% breakdown point in simultaneous M-estimation of location and scale+Dasiou, D; Moyssiadis, C+STATISTICAL PAPERS+APR 2001::ROBUST ESTIMATION OF VARIANCE-COMPONENTS+FELLNER, WH+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1986::On parametric bootstrap methods for small area prediction+Hall, P; Maiti, T+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD APPROACHES TO VARIANCE COMPONENT ESTIMATION AND TO RELATED PROBLEMS+HARVILLE, DA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::Mixed model prediction and small area estimation+Jiang, JM; Lahiri, P+TEST+JUN 2006::REGRESSION QUANTILES+KOENKER, R; BASSETT, G+ECONOMETRICA+1978::Quantile regression+Koenker, R; Hallock, KF+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES+FAL 2001::no title+Koenker, R.+Quantile Regression+2005::Measuring firm performance by using linear and non-parametric quantile regressions+Landajo, Manuel; de Andres, Javier; Lorca, Pedro+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+2008::Bootstrap for estimating the MSE of the Spatial EBLUP+Molina, Isabel; Salvati, Nicola; Pratesi, Monica+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+AUG 2009::Some Remarks on the Registerbased Census 2010/2011 in Germany+Munnich, R; Gabler, S.; Ganninger, M.+P WORKSH INN METH CE+2007::Synthetic and composite estimation under a superpopulation model+Niemiro, Wojciech; Wesolowski, Jacek+STATISTICAL PAPERS+SEP 2010::Geographic Information in Small Area Estimation: Small Area Models and Spatially Correlated Random Area Effects+Petrucci, A.; Pratesi, M.; Salvati, N.+Statistics in Transition+2005::THE ESTIMATION OF THE MEAN SQUARED ERROR OF SMALL-AREA ESTIMATORS+PRASAD, NGN; RAO, JNK+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1990::Small area estimation: the EBLUP estimator based on spatially correlated random area effects+Pratesi, Monica; Salvati, Nicola+STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS+2008::no title+Rao, J.

Compared with the CE model, the PH model provides more flexibility in fitting step-stress testing data and has the attractive mathematical properties of being desirable in the Bayesian framework.

Penalized estimation in additive varying coefficient models using grouped regularization,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0522-1,AUG 2014,47,10,"Additive varying coefficient models are a natural extension of multiple linear regression models, allowing the regression coefficients to be functions of other variables. Therefore these models are more flexible to model more complex dependencies in data structures. In this paper we consider the problem of selecting in an automatic way the significant variables among a large set of variables, when the interest is on a given response variable. In recent years several grouped regularization methods have been proposed and in this paper we present these under one unified framework in this varying coefficient model context. For each of the discussed grouped regularization methods we investigate the optimization problem to be solved, possible algorithms for doing so, and the variable and estimation consistency of the methods. We investigate the finite-sample performance of these methods, in a comparative study, and illustrate them on real data examples.","Grouped Lasso regularization,Multiple linear regression models,Variables selection,Varying coefficient models","VARIABLE SELECTION,LONGITUDINAL DATA,GROUP LASSO,P-SPLINES,REGRESSION,LIKELIHOOD,SHRINKAGE","Antoniadis, A.@Univ Grenoble 1, Tour IRMA, Dept Stat, Lab Jean Kuntzmann, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France::Gijbels, I.@Leuven Stat Res Ctr LStat, Dept Math, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium::Lambert-Lacroix, S.@Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UPMF, TIMC IMAG,UMR 5525, F-38041 Grenoble, France","Antoniadis, A.@Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble@Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes@Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Inria@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@Universite Bretagne Loire (ComUE)::Gijbels, I.@Unknow::Lambert-Lacroix, S.@Universite de Lyon (ComUE)@CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS)@Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble@Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes@Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA)@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)@Universite Clermont Auvergne & Associes@Universite Cote d'Azur (ComUE)@VetAgro Sup","Lambert-Lacroix, Sophie@M-6795-2014","Variable Selection in Varying-Coefficient Models Using P-Splines+Antoniadis, Anestis; Gijbels, Irene; Verhasselt, Anneleen+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+SEP 2012::Variable Selection in Additive Models Using P-Splines+Antoniadis, Anestis; Gijbels, Irene; Verhasselt, Anneleen+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 2012::Regularization methods for additive models+Avalos, M; Grandvalet, Y; Ambroise, C+ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS V+2003::Consistency of the group Lasso and multiple kernel learning+Bach, Francis R.+JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH+JUN 2008::The calculation of integrals involving B-splines by means of recursion relations+Bhatti, M; Bracken, P+APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION+JAN 1 2006::SIMULTANEOUS ANALYSIS OF LASSO AND DANTZIG SELECTOR+Bickel, Peter J.; Ritov, Ya'acov; Tsybakov, Alexandre B.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2009::Nonmonotone spectral projected gradient methods on convex sets+Birgin, EG; Martinez, JM; Raydan, M+SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION+JUN 18 2000::Coordinate descent algorithms for nonconvex penalized regression, with appli- cations to biological feature selection+Breheny, P; Huang, J.+Ann Appl Stat+2011::Penalized methods for bi-level variable selection+Breheny, Patrick; Huang, Jian+STATISTICS AND ITS INTERFACE+2009::Smoothing spline models for the analysis of nested and crossed samples of curves+Brumback, BA; Rice, JA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1998::FUNCTIONAL-COEFFICIENT AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS+CHEN, R; TSAY, RS+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1993::Adapting to unknown smoothness via wavelet shrinkage+Donoho, DL; Johnstone, IM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1995::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::Nonconcave penalized likelihood with a diverging number of parameters+Fan, JQ; Peng, H+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 2004::Generalized likelihood ratio statistics and Wilks phenomenon+Fan, JQ; Zhang, CM; Zhang, J+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2001::Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties+Fan, JQ; Li, RZ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2001::Two-step estimation of functional linear models with applications to longitudinal data+Fan, JQ; Zhang, JT+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2000::Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction: Application to Compressed Sensing and Other Inverse Problems+Figueiredo, Mario A.

Bayes estimators have been developed under symmetric (squared error) and asymmetric (LINEX) loss functions using the conjugate and non informative prior distributions. The approximation forms of Lindley (Trabajos de Estadistica 3:281-288, 1980) and Tierney and Kadane (J Am Stat Assoc 81:82-86, 1986) are used for the Bayesian cases.

The model can be viewed under a more natural perspective, as a Bayesian semiparametric regression model on the log-scale; hence, in the original scale, the error is a mixture of Weibull densities mixed on both parameters by a normalized generalized gamma random measure, encompassing the Dirichlet process. As an estimate of the posterior distribution of the clustering of the random-effects parameters, we consider the partition minimizing the posterior expectation of a suitable class of loss functions. As a merely illustrative application of our model we consider a Kevlar fibre lifetime dataset (with censoring). We implement an MCMC scheme, obtaining posterior credibility intervals for the predictive distributions and for the quantiles of the failure times under different stress levels. Compared to a previous parametric Bayesian analysis, we obtain narrower credibility intervals and a better fit to the data. We found that there are three main clusters among the random-effects parameters, in accordance with previous frequentist analysis.","Bayesian nonparametrics,Clustering,Hierarchical models,Mixture models,Nonparametric models,Generalized linear mixed models",MIXTURE,"Argiento, Raffaele@CNR, IMATI, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Guglielmi, Alessandra@Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Matemat, I-20133 Milan, Italy::Pievatolo, Antonio@CNR, IMATI, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Argiento, Raffaele@Istituto di Matematica Applicata e Tecnologie Informatiche ""Enrico Magenes"" (IMATI-CNR)@Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)::Guglielmi, Alessandra@Polytechnic University of Milan::Pievatolo, Antonio@Istituto di Matematica Applicata e Tecnologie Informatiche ""Enrico Magenes"" (IMATI-CNR)@Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)","Argiento, Raffaele@H-3158-2017@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8416-1642","A semiparametric Bayesian generalized linear mixed model for the reliability of Kevlar fibers+Argiento, R; Guglielmi, A; Soriano, J.+Appl Stoch Models Bus Ind+2012::Nonparametric Bayesian mixture modelling for failure time data+Argiento, R; Guglielmi, A; Pievatolo, A.+Technical report no. 08.3-MI+2008::Mixed-effects modelling of Kevlar fibre failure times through Bayesian non-parametrics+Argiento, Raffaele; Guglielmi, Alessandra; Pievatolo, Antonio+COMPLEX DATA MODELING AND COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE STATISTICAL METHODS+2010::Bayesian density estimation and model selection using nonparametric hierarchical mixtures+Argiento, Raffaele; Guglielmi, Alessandra; Pievatolo, Antonio+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+APR 1 2010::APPROXIMATIONS TO BAYESIAN CLUSTERING RULES+BINDER, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1981::BAYESIAN CLUSTER-ANALYSIS+BINDER, DA+BIOMETRIKA+1978::no title+Crowder, MJ; Kimber, AC; Smith, RL.+Statistical analysis of reliability data+1991::Bayesian Nonparametric Nonproportional Hazards Survival Modeling+De Iorio, Maria; Johnson, Wesley O.; Mueller, Peter; et al.+BIOMETRICS+SEP 2009::Improved Criteria for Clustering Based on the Posterior Similarity Matrix+Fritsch, Arno; Ickstadt, Katja+BAYESIAN ANALYSIS+2009::BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE - ASYMPTOTICS AND EXACT CALCULATIONS+GELFAND, AE; DEY, DK+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1994::Prediction of long-term failure in Kevlar 49 composites+Gerstle Jr, FP; Kunz, SC.+Long-term behavior of composites+1983::Semiparametric accelerated failure time models for censored data+Ghosh, S.

Simulation results indicate that the proposed AEL-based confidence intervals perform better compared with normality-based or EL-based confidence intervals specifically for small sample size within the right-censoring setting.

Principal points for an allometric extension model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0532-z,AUG 2014,50,3,"A set of -principal points of a -dimensional distribution is an optimal -point-approximation of the distribution in terms of a squared error loss. It is in general difficult to derive an explicit expression of principal points. Hence, we may have to search the whole space for -principal points. Many efforts have been devoted to establish results that specify a linear subspace in which principal points lie. However, the previous studies focused on elliptically symmetric distributions and location mixtures of spherically symmetric distributions, which may not be suitable to many practical situations. In this paper, we deal with a mixture of elliptically symmetric distributions that form an allometric extension model, which has been widely used in the context of principal component analysis. We give conditions under which principal points lie in the linear subspace spanned by the first several principal components.","Allometric extension model,Elliptically symmetric distribution,Multivariate mixture distribution,Principal components,Principal points,Principal subspace theorem","SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC DISTRIBUTIONS,OPTIMAL BINNING STRATEGIES,SELF-CONSISTENT POINTS,UNIVARIATE CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS,NORMAL MIXTURE MODEL,K-MEANS ALGORITHM,ELLIPTIC DISTRIBUTIONS,LOCATION MIXTURES,PLACEBO RESPONDERS,FUNCTIONAL DATA","Matsuura, Shun@Keio Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Kohoku Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan::Kurata, Hiroshi@Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan","Matsuura, Shun@Keio University::Kurata, Hiroshi@University of Tokyo",not exist,"Allometric extension+Bartoletti, S;

Order selection in finite mixtures of linear regressions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0534-x,AUG 2014,73,5,"Finite mixture models can adequately model population heterogeneity when this heterogeneity arises from a finite number of relatively homogeneous clusters. An example of such a situation is market segmentation. Order selection in mixture models, i.e. selecting the correct number of components, however, is a problem which has not been satisfactorily resolved. Existing simulation results in the literature do not completely agree with each other. Moreover, it appears that the performance of different selection methods is affected by the type of model and the parameter values. Furthermore, most existing results are based on simulations where the true generating model is identical to one of the models in the candidate set. In order to partly fill this gap we carried out a (relatively) large simulation study for finite mixture models of normal linear regressions. We included several types of model (mis)specification to study the robustness of 18 order selection methods. Furthermore, we compared the performance of these selection methods based on unpenalized and penalized estimates of the model parameters. The results indicate that order selection based on penalized estimates greatly improves the success rates of all order selection methods. The most successful methods were , , , -, , , and but not one method was consistently good or best for all types of model (mis)specification.","Finite mixture,Regression,Penalized likelihood,Order selection","LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS,KULLBACKS SYMMETRIC DIVERGENCE,AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION,LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS,MODEL-SELECTION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,EM ALGORITHM,SWITCHING REGRESSIONS,AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL,NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS","Depraetere, Nicolas@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium::Vandebroek, Martina@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium@Leuven Stat Res Ctr, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium","Depraetere, Nicolas@KU Leuven::Vandebroek, Martina@KU Leuven","Vandebroek, Martina@J-9103-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0317-1986","Analysis of stopping criteria for the EM algorithm in the context of patient grouping according to length of stay+Abbi, R; El-Darzi, E; Vasilakis, C<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Millard, P</span>.+4 INT IEEE C INT SYS+2008::NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::Retention of latent segments in regression-based marketing models+Andrews, RL; Currim, IS+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING+DEC 2003::A comparison of segment retention criteria for finite mixture logit models+Andrews, RL; Currim, IS+JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH+MAY 2003::Latent variable regression for multiple discrete outcomes+Bandeen-Roche, K; Miglioretti, DL; Zeger, SL; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1997::MODEL-BASED GAUSSIAN AND NON-GAUSSIAN CLUSTERING+BANFIELD, JD; RAFTERY, AE+BIOMETRICS+SEP 1993::SOME PROPERTIES OF ORDER OF AN AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL SELECTED BY A GENERALIZATION OF AKAIKES EPF CRITERION+BHANSALI, RJ; DOWNHAM, DY+BIOMETRIKA+1977::Using the classification likelihood to choose the number of clusters+Biernacki, C; Govaert, G.+Comput Sci Stat+1997::Choosing starting values for the EM algorithm for getting the highest likelihood in multivariate Gaussian mixture models+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+JUL 2000::An improvement of the NEC criterion for assessing the number of clusters in a mixture model+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS+MAR 1999::Assessing a mixture model for cluster with the integrated classification likelihood+Biernacki, C.; Celeux, G.; Govaert, G.+Tech.

The asymptotic properties of unrestricted as well as restricted estimators are studied without imposing any distributional assumption on any random component of the model.

Understanding their meaning is not a simple task. The aim of this paper is to expand the usefulness of the reversed hazard function by relating it to other well-known concepts broadly used in economics: (linear or cumulative) rates of increase and elasticity. This will make it possible (i) to improve our understanding of the consequences of using a particular distribution and, in certain cases, (ii) to introduce our hypotheses and knowledge about the random process in a more meaningful and intuitive way, thus providing a means to achieving distributions that would otherwise be hardly imaginable or justifiable.","Elasticity function,Hazard function,Probability distribution,Rate of increase,Reversed hazard function,Statistical characterization",REGRESSION-MODELS,"Veres-Ferrer, Ernesto J.@Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain::Pavia, Jose M.@Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain","Veres-Ferrer, Ernesto J.@University of Valencia::Pavia, Jose M.@University of Valencia","Pavia, Jose M.@H-8678-2017","On the Reversed Hazard Rate and Mean Inactivity Time of Mixtures+Badia, F.

Then, we show that the general form of this type of test statistics is invariant for the choice of weights. This fact is important since in practice many such test statistics are constructed with more complicated forms which usually require calculating generalized inverse matrices. Based on our results, we can simplify the construction of the test statistics. More importantly, properties such as anti-conservativeness of this type of test statistics can be drawn from Cochran test statistic. Furthermore, one can improve the performance of the tests by using some modified statistics with correction for small sample size situations.","Asymptotic distribution,Chi-squaredistribution,DeSimonian-Laird test,Invariant","F-TEST,HETEROGENEITY","Chen, Zhongxue@Indiana Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA::Ng, Hon Keung Tony@So Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA::Nadarajah, Saralees@Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Chen, Zhongxue@Indiana University Bloomington@Indiana University System::Ng, Hon Keung Tony@Southern Methodist University::Nadarajah, Saralees@University of Manchester",", Zhongxue@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2537-7843","COPING WITH VARIANCE HETEROGENEITY+ASIRIBO, O; GURLAND, J+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1990::The exact distribution of Cochran's heterogeneity statistic in one-way random effects meta-analysis+Biggerstaff, Brad J.; Jackson, Dan+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+DEC 20 2008::A K-SAMPLE MEDIAN TEST FOR CENSORED-DATA+BROOKMEYER, R; CROWLEY, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1982::Problems arising in the analysis of a series of similar experiments.+COCHRAN, W.

A generalized skew two-piece skew-elliptical distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0485-7,MAY 2014,14,2,"We present a new generalized family of skew two-piece skew-elliptical (GSTPSE) models and derive some its statistical properties. It is shown that the new family of distribution may be written as a mixture of generalized skew elliptical distributions. Also, a new representation theorem for a special case of GSTPSE-distribution is given. Next, we will focus on t kernel density and prove that it is a scale mixture of the generalized skew two-piece skew normal distributions. An explicit expression for the central moments as well as a recurrence relations for its cumulative distribution function and density are obtained. Since, this special case is a uni-/bimodal distribution, a sufficient condition for each cases is given. A real data set on heights of Australian females athletes is analysed.

Local influence for functional comparative calibration models with replicated data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0489-3,MAY 2014,42,4,"We investigate local influence analysis in functional comparative calibration models with replicated data. A method for selecting appropriate perturbation schemes based on the expected Fisher information matrix with respect to the perturbation vector is proposed. It is shown that arbitrarily perturbing these models may result in misleading inference about the influential subjects. First-order influence measures for identifying the correct influential subjects and replicates on corrected score estimators are defined. We introduce different perturbation schemes including perturbation of subjects and replicates on the corrected likelihood function and obtain the density of the perturbed model from which the methodology is based. Particularly, three perturbation of variances schemes could be a better way to handle badly modeled subjects or replicates. Two real data sets are analyzed to illustrate the use of our local influence measures.","Local influence,Comparative calibration,Replicate measurement,Corrected score,Appropriate perturbation","MEASUREMENT ERROR MODELS,LINEAR STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIPS,INFLUENCE DIAGNOSTICS,ANALYTICAL BIAS,IN-VARIABLES,REGRESSION,AGREEMENT,ACCURACY","Gimenez, Patricia@Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, FCEYN, Dept Matemat, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina::Laura Patat, Maria@Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, FCEYN, Dept Matemat, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Gimenez, Patricia@National University of Mar del Plata::Laura Patat, Maria@National University of Mar del Plata",not exist,"SIMULTANEOUS PAIRWISE LINEAR STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIPS+BARNETT, VD+BIOMETRICS+1969::DIAGNOSTICS FOR MIXED-MODEL ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE+BECKMAN, RJ; NACHTSHEIM, CJ; COOK, RD+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::Measuring agreement in method comparison studies+Bland, JM; Altman, DG+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+JUN 1999::no title+Carstensen, B; Gurrin, L; Ekstrom, C.+Meth-Comp: functions for analysis of method comparison studies.

Non nested model selection for spatial count regression models with application to health insurance,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0491-9,MAY 2014,27,4,"In this paper we consider spatial regression models for count data. We examine not only the Poisson distribution but also the generalized Poisson capable of modeling over-dispersion, the negative Binomial as well as the zero-inflated Poisson distribution which allows for excess zeros as possible response distribution. We add random spatial effects for modeling spatial dependency and develop and implement MCMC algorithms in for Bayesian estimation. The corresponding R library 'spatcounts' is available on CRAN. In an application the presented models are used to analyze the number of benefits received per patient in a German private health insurance company. Since the deviance information criterion is only appropriate for exponential family models, we use in addition the Vuong and Clarke test with a Schwarz correction to compare possibly non nested models.

The particular case leads us to the discrete half-normal distribution which is different from the discrete half-normal distribution proposed previously in the statistical literature. This distribution is unimodal, overdispersed (the responses show a mean sample greater than the variance) and with an increasing failure rate. We revise its properties and the question of parameter estimation.

Testing the null hypothesis of zero serial correlation in short panel time series: a comparison of tail probabilities,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0495-5,MAY 2014,15,0,"It is known that the analysis of short panel time series data is very important in many practical problems. This paper calculates the exact moments up to order 4 under the null hypothesis of no serial correlation when there are many independent replications of size 3. We further calculate the tail probabilities under the null hypothesis using the Edgeworth approximation for and when the structure of the pdf (probability density function) of the test statistic is in essence different. Finally, we compare the three types of tail probabilities, namely, the Edgeworth approximation, the normal approximation and the exact probabilities through a large scale simulation study.","Small samples,Serial correlation,Estimation,Repeated measurements,Panel data,Edgeworth expansion,Tail probability,Autoregression,Cumulants,Moments,Time series,Inference","SMALL SAMPLES,APPROXIMATIONS","Peiris, Shelton@Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Peiris, Shelton@University of Sydney",not exist,"Unbalanced panel data: A survey+Baltagi, Badi H.; Song, Seuck Heun+STATISTICAL PAPERS+OCT 2006::ON TESTING FOR SERIAL-CORRELATION IN LARGE NUMBERS OF SMALL SAMPLES+COX, DR; SOLOMON, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1988::State space mixed models for longitudinal observations with binary and binomial responses+Czado, Claudia; Song, Peter X. -K.+STATISTICAL PAPERS+OCT 2008::Modelling panels of intercorrelated autoregressive time series+Hjellvik, V; Tjostheim, D.+Biometrika+1999::SOME THEOREMS ON TIME SERIES .2.

A popular approach to model their dependence is the use of copula functions. Our contribution is to derive expressions for the observed and expected information for several bivariate copula families, in particular for the Student's -copula. Further likelihood derivatives which are required for numerical implementations are computed and a numerically stable implementation is provided in the R-package VineCopula. Using a real world data set of stock returns, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach for the routinely calculation of standard errors. In particular, we illustrate how this prevents overestimating the time-variation of dependence parameters in a rolling window analysis.","Copula,Expected information,Observed information,Derivatives","DEPENDENT RANDOM-VARIABLES,LIKELIHOOD INFERENCE,ARCHIMEDEAN COPULAS,MODEL,DISTRIBUTIONS,CONSTRUCTIONS,VINES","Schepsmeier, Ulf@Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Math Stat, D-85748 Garching, Germany::Stoeber, Jakob@Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Math Stat, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Schepsmeier, Ulf@Technical University of Munich::Stoeber, Jakob@Technical University of Munich",not exist,"Pair-copula constructions of multiple dependence+Aas, Kjersti; Czado, Claudia; Frigessi, Arnoldo; et al.+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+APR 2009::no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.A.+HDB MATH FUNCTIONS F+1992::Beyond simplified pair-copula constructions+Acar, Elif F.; Genest, Christian; Neslehova, Johanna+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+SEP 2012::Probability density decomposition for conditionally dependent random variables modeled by vines+Bedford, T; Cooke, RM+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE+2001::Vines - A new graphical model for dependent random variables+Bedford, T; Cooke, RM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2002::no title+Bedford, T; Daneshkhah, A.+Approximating multivariate distributions with vines+2010::Objective priors for the bivariate normal model+Berger, James O.; Sun, Dongchu+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2008::AN ADAPTIVE ALGORITHM FOR THE APPROXIMATE CALCULATION OF MULTIPLE INTEGRALS+BERNTSEN, J; ESPELID, TO; GENZ, A+ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE+DEC 1991::no title+BICKEL PJ+MATH STAT BASIC IDEA+2007::Derivatives of the incomplete beta function+Boik, RJ; Robison-Cox, JF.+Journal of Statistical Software+1998::STATISTICAL INFERENCE FOR MULTIVARIATE RESIDUAL COPULA OF GARCH MODELS+Chan, Ngai-Hang; Chen, Jian; Chen, Xiaohong; et al.+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2009::A mixed copula model for insurance claims and claim sizes+Czado, Claudia; Kastenmeier, Rainer; Brechmann, Eike Christian; et al.+SCANDINAVIAN ACTUARIAL JOURNAL+DEC 1 2012::The t copula and related copulas+Demarta, S; McNeil, AJ+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 2005::COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH CONFIDENCE-REGIONS AND CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS FOR NONLINEAR LEAST-SQUARES+DONALDSON, JR; SCHNABEL, RB+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1987::ASSESSING ACCURACY OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR - OBSERVED VERSUS EXPECTED FISHER INFORMATION+EFRON, B; HINKLEY, DV+BIOMETRIKA+1978::Correlation and dependency risk management: properties and pitfalls+Embrechts, P.; McNeil, A.; Straumann, D.+Risk Management: Value at Risk and Beyond+2002::no title+Genz, A.

Local expectations of the population spectral distribution of a high-dimensional covariance matrix,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-013-0501-6,MAY 2014,14,0,"This paper discusses the relationship between the population spectral distribution and the limit of the empirical spectral distribution in high-dimensional situations. When the support of the limiting spectral distribution is split into several intervals, the population one gains a meaningful division, and general functional expectations of each part from the division, referred as local expectations, can be formulated as contour integrals around these intervals. Basing on these knowledge we present consistent estimators of the local expectations and prove a central limit theorem for them. The results are then used to analyze an estimator of the population spectral distribution in recent literature.","High,dimensional covariance matrix,Limiting spectral distribution,Local expectation,Population spectral distribution,Stieltjes transform",EIGENVALUE,"Li, Weiming@Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Sci, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China","Li, Weiming@Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications",not exist,"CLT for linear spectral statistics of large-dimensional sample covariance matrices+Bai, ZD; Silverstein, JW+ANNALS OF PROBABILITY+JAN 2004::no title+Bai, ZD; Silverstein, JW.+Spectral Analysis of Large Dimensional Random Matrices+2010::ON ESTIMATION OF THE POPULATION SPECTRAL DISTRIBUTION FROM A HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SAMPLE COVARIANCE MATRIX+Bai, Zhidong; Chen, Jiaqi; Yao, Jianfeng+AUSTRALIAN &amp; NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 2010::SPECTRUM ESTIMATION FOR LARGE DIMENSIONAL COVARIANCE MATRICES USING RANDOM MATRIX THEORY+El Karoui, Noureddine+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2008::A COMPLEX ROLLES THEOREM+EVARD, JC; JAFARI, F+AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL MONTHLY+NOV 1992::On the distribution of the largest eigenvalue in principal components analysis+Johnstone, IM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2001::Estimation of the population spectral distribution from a large dimensional sample covariance matrix+Li, WM; Chen, JQ; Qin, YL<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Yao, JF; Bai, ZD</span>.+ArXiv:1302.0355+2013::A local moment estimation of the spectrum of a large dimensional covariance matrix+Li, WM; Yao, JF.+ArXiv:1302.0356+2013::Distribution of eigenvalues for some sets of random matrices+Marcenko, V.

Over time, it has increasingly been recognized that the safest and most feasible approach to exposing outliers starts by computing a highly robust estimator of location and scatter that can withstand a large proportion of contamination. Many such estimators have been proposed in recent years. We will compare the worst-case bias of several prominent robust multivariate estimators by means of simulation. We also propose a new tool to compare robust estimators on real data sets, and illustrate it.","Outlier identification,Multivariate estimation,Robust estimation","FAST ALGORITHM,REGRESSION,LOCATION","Hubert, M.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, BE-3001 Louvain, Belgium::Rousseeuw, P.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, BE-3001 Louvain, Belgium::Vakili, K.@Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, BE-3001 Louvain, Belgium","Hubert, M.@KU Leuven::Rousseeuw, P.@KU Leuven::Vakili, K.@KU Leuven","Hubert, Mia@B-7434-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6398-4850","no title+[Anonymous].+Google Flu Trends+2012::BACON: blocked adaptive computationally efficient outlier nominators+Billor, N; Hadi, AS; Velleman, PF+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 28 2000::Stability of principal component analysis studied by bootstrap method+Daudin, J.

The procedure is nonparametric; it uses q-dimensional depth plots and a very efficient algorithm for discrimination analysis in the depth space [0,1] (q) . Specifically, the depth is the zonoid depth, and the algorithm is the alpha-procedure. In case of more than two classes several binary classifications are performed and a majority rule is applied. Special treatments are discussed for 'outsiders', that is, data having zero depth vector. The D D alpha-classifier is applied to simulated as well as real data, and the results are compared with those of similar procedures that have been recently proposed. In most cases the new procedure has comparable error rates, but is much faster than other classification approaches, including the support vector machine.","Alpha-procedure,Zonoid depth,DD-plot,Pattern recognition,Supervised learning,Misclassification rate,Support vector machine","DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,REGRESSION DEPTH,INFERENCE","Lange, Tatjana@Hsch Merseburg, D-06217 Merseburg, Germany::Mosler, Karl@Univ Cologne, D-50923 Cologne, Germany::Mozharovskyi, Pavlo@Univ Cologne, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Lange, Tatjana@Unknow::Mosler, Karl@University of Cologne::Mozharovskyi, Pavlo@University of Cologne",not exist,"no title+Asuncion, Arthur; Newman, David.+Uci machine learning repository+2007::Data depth: Multivariate statistics and geometry+Cascos, I.+New Perspectives in Stochastic Geometry+2009::Comparison between various regression depth methods and the support vector machine to approximate the minimum number of misclassifications+Christmann, A; Fischer, P; Joachims, T+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+2002::The random Tukey depth+Cuesta-Albertos, J.

"Analysis of crack growth with robust, distribution-free estimators and tests for non-stationary autoregressive processes",STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0479-5,FEB 2014,20,2,"This article investigates the application of depth estimators to crack growth models in construction engineering. Many crack growth models are based on the Paris-Erdogan equation which describes crack growth by a deterministic differential equation. By introducing a stochastic error term, crack growth can be modeled by a non-stationary autoregressive process with L,vy-type errors. A regression depth approach is presented to estimate the drift parameter of the process. We then prove the consistency of the estimator under quite general assumptions on the error distribution. By an extension of the depth notion to simplical depth it is possible to use a degenerated U-statistic and to establish tests for general hypotheses about the drift parameter. Since the statistic asymptotically has a transformed distribution, simple confidence intervals for the drift parameter can be obtained. In the second part, simulations of AR(1) processes with different error distributions are used to examine the quality of the constructed test. Finally we apply the presented method to crack growth experiments. We compare two datasets from independent experiments under different conditions but with the same material. We show that the parameter estimates differ significantly in this case.","Crack growth,Stochastic differential equation,Autoregressive process,Data depth,Robustness,Maximum depth estimator,Simplical depth,Tests","STOCHASTIC DIFFERENCE-EQUATIONS,SIMPLICIAL DEPTH,REGRESSION,NOTION","Kustosz, Christoph P.@TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Stat, Dortmund, Germany::Mueller, Christine H.@TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Stat, Dortmund, Germany","Kustosz, Christoph P.@Dortmund University of Technology::Mueller, Christine H.@Dortmund University of Technology","Kustosz, Christoph@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3869-0636","ON ASYMPTOTIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF ESTIMATES OF PARAMETERS OF STOCHASTIC DIFFERENCE-EQUATIONS+ANDERSON, TW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1959::BOOTSTRAPPING EXPLOSIVE AUTOREGRESSIVE PROCESSES+BASAWA, IV; MALLIK, AK; MCCORMICK, WP; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 1989::The sign test for stochastic processes+Huggins, R.+Aust.

On robustifying some second order blind source separation methods for nonstationary time series,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-012-0487-5,FEB 2014,29,7,"Blind source separation (BSS) is an important analysis tool in various signal processing applications like image, speech or medical signal analysis. The most popular BSS solutions have been developed for independent component analysis (ICA) with identically and independently distributed (iid) observation vectors. In many BSS applications the assumption on iid observations is not realistic, however, as the data are often an observed time series with temporal correlation and even nonstationarity. In this paper, some BSS methods for time series with nonstationary variances are discussed. We also suggest ways to robustify these methods and illustrate their performance in a simulation study.","Blind source separation,Joint diagonalisation,Nonstationarity,Robustness,Time series","MIXTURES,SIGNALS","Nordhausen, Klaus@Univ Tampere, Sch Informat Sci, Tampere 33014, Finland@Univ Tampere, Sch Hlth Sci, Tampere 33014, Finland","Nordhausen, Klaus@University of Tampere","Nordhausen, Klaus@A-8644-2008@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3758-8501","no title+[Anonymous].+R:A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2011::A blind source separation technique using second-order statistics+Belouchrani, A; AbedMeraim, K; Cardoso, JF; et al.+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING+FEB 1997::BLIND BEAMFORMING FOR NON-GAUSSIAN SIGNALS+CARDOSO, JF; SOULOUMIAC, A+IEE PROCEEDINGS-F RADAR AND SIGNAL PROCESSING+DEC 1993::Sources separation using higher moments+Cardoso, JF.+P 2000 IEEE INT C AC+1989::Blind separation of nonstationary sources in noisy mixtures+Choi, S; Cichocki, A+ELECTRONICS LETTERS+APR 27 2000::Blind separation of second-order nonstationary and temporally colored sources+Choi, S.; Cichocki, A.; Belouchrani, A.+P 11 IEEE SIGN PROC+2001::Blind separation of nonstationary and temporally correlated sources from noisy mixtures+Choi, S.; Cichocki, A.+P 10 IEEE WORKSH NEU+2000::no title+Cichocki, A.; Amari, S.+Adaptive Blind Signal and Image Processing: Learning Algorithms and Applications+2002::Handbook of Blind Source Separation: Independent Component Analysis and Applications+no author+HANDBOOK OF BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION: INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS+2010::A practical affine equivariant multivariate median+Hettmansperger, TP; Randles, RH+BIOMETRIKA+DEC 2002::no title+Hyvarinen, A.; Karhunen, J.; Oja, E.+Independent Component Analysis+2001::A New Performance Index for ICA: Properties, Computation and Asymptotic Analysis+Ilmonen, Pauliina; Nordhausen, Klaus; Oja, Hannu; et al.+LATENT VARIABLE ANALYSIS AND SIGNAL SEPARATION+2010::no title+Maronna, RA; Martin, RD; Yohai, VJ.+Robust statistics.

Control charts for the coefficient of variation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0797-0,SEP 2018,22,0,"The coefficient of variation (CV) has received an extensive attention in quality control. The existing control charts for monitoring the two-sided changes in the CV do not consider the average run length (ARL) unbiased criterion. In practice, the practitioners prefer the ARL-unbiased control charts. This paper proposes an ARL-unbiased Shewhart-type control chart to monitor the two-sided shifts in the CV. Then an ARL-unbiased synthetic chart in which the conforming run length sub-chart only needs a lower control limit is proposed to improve the performance of the ARL-unbiased Shewhart-type chart. The comparison results show that the proposed synthetic chart outperforms the proposed ARL-unbiased control chart in terms of the ARL. The effects of the parameter estimation on the proposed charts are also studied. Finally, a real example is used to illustrate the proposed control charts.","Coefficient of variation,Average run length,Unbiased control chart,Parameter estimation","ASYMMETRIC CONTROL LIMITS,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,(X)OVER-BAR","Guo, Baocai@Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Stat, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China::Wang, Bing Xing@Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Stat, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Guo, Baocai@Zhejiang Gongshang University::Wang, Bing Xing@Zhejiang Gongshang University",not exist,"DETECTING A SHIFT IN FRACTION NONCONFORMING USING RUN-LENGTH CONTROL CHARTS WITH 100-PERCENT INSPECTION+BOURKE, PD+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 1991::A synthetic control chart for the coefficient of variation+Calzada, Maria E.; Scariano, Stephen M.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+MAY 1 2013::Monitoring the Coefficient of Variation Using EWMA Charts+Castagliola, Philippe; Celano, Giovanni; Psarakis, Stelios+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+JUL 2011::Monitoring the Coefficient of Variation Using a Variable Sampling Interval Control Chart+Castagliola, Philippe; Achouri, Ali; Taleb, Hassen; et al.+QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL+DEC 2013::Monitoring the Coefficient of Variation Using Control Charts with Run Rules+Castagliola, Philippe; Achouri, Au; Taleb, Hassen; et al.+QUALITY TECHNOLOGY AND QUANTITATIVE MANAGEMENT+MAR 2013::Comparisons of the symmetric and asymmetric control limits for (X)over-bar and R charts+Chen, Huifen; Kuo, Wei-Lun+COMPUTERS &amp; INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING+NOV 2010::Effects of parameter estimation on control chart properties: A literature review+Jensen, Willis A.; Jones-Farmer, L.

Two step estimations for a single-index varying-coefficient model with longitudinal data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0798-z,SEP 2018,40,0,"In this paper, we propose a two step estimation procedure to improve estimation efficiency of the index coefficients and unknown functions. Specifically, in the first step, we obtain the initial estimators by ignoring the possible correlations between repeated measures. Based on the modified Cholesky decomposition, we apply the least squares technique to estimate the autoregressive coefficients and innovation variance, and then obtain the estimated within-subject covariance matrix. In the second step, we construct the centralized generalized estimating equations to obtain more efficient estimators of index coefficients. Based on the estimated index coefficients, we can obtain more efficient estimators of unknown functions by employing the weighted least squares approach. Simulation studies and progesterone data have proved that the two step estimators are more efficient in practice.","Efficiency,Generalized estimating equations,Local linear regression,Longitudinal data,Modified Cholesky decomposition,Single-index varying-coefficient model","QUADRATIC INFERENCE FUNCTIONS,COVARIANCE REGRESSION-ANALYSIS,EFFICIENT ESTIMATION METHOD,VARIABLE SELECTION,ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION,SPLINE ESTIMATION,ROBUST","Guo, Chaohui@Chongqing Univ, Coll Math & Stat, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China@Chongqing Normal Univ, Coll Math Sci, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China::Yang, Hu@Chongqing Univ, Coll Math & Stat, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China::Lv, Jing@Southwest Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China","Guo, Chaohui@Chongqing Normal University@Chongqing University::Yang, Hu@Chongqing University::Lv, Jing@Southwest University - China","Yang, Hu@A-8108-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6589-8534","Penalized estimation in additive varying coefficient models using grouped regularization+Antoniadis, A.;

A flexible shrinkage operator for fussy grouped variable selection,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0799-y,SEP 2018,22,0,"Existing grouped variable selection methods rely heavily on prior group information, thus they may not be reliable if an incorrect group assignment is used. In this paper, we propose a family of shrinkage variable selection operators by controlling the k-th largest norm (KAN). The proposed KAN method exhibits some flexible group-wise variable selection naturally even though no correct prior group information is available. We also construct a group KAN shrinkage operator using a composite of KAN constraints. Neither ignoring nor relying completely on prior group information, the group KAN method has the flexibility of controlling within group strength and therefore can reduce the effect caused by incorrect group information. Finally, we investigate an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom for (group) KAN estimates in the framework of Stein's unbiased risk estimation. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis are performed to demonstrate the advantage of KAN and group KAN over the LASSO and group LASSO, respectively.","Degrees of freedom,Group shrinkage,k-th largest norm,Shrinkage estimator,Variable selection","MODEL SELECTION,REGRESSION,LASSO,ASYMPTOTICS,ESTIMATORS","Gao, Xiaoli@106 Petty Bldg,1400 Spring Garden St, Greensboro, NC USA","Gao, Xiaoli@Unknow",not exist,"MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD IDENTIFICATION OF GAUSSIAN AUTOREGRESSIVE MOVING AVERAGE MODELS+AKAIKE, H+BIOMETRIKA+1973::COX REGRESSION-MODEL FOR COUNTING-PROCESSES - A LARGE SAMPLE STUDY+ANDERSEN, PK; GILL, RD+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1982::SLOPE-ADAPTIVE VARIABLE SELECTION VIA CONVEX OPTIMIZATION+Bogdan, Malgorzata; van den Berg, Ewout; Sabatti, Chiara; et al.+Annals of Applied Statistics+SEP 2015::Extended Bayesian information criteria for model selection with large model spaces+Chen, Jiahua; Chen, Zehua+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 2008::Homozygosity mapping with SNP arrays identifies TRIM32 an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a Bardet-Biedl syndrome gene (BBS11)+Chiang, AP; Beck, JS; Yen, HJ; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+APR 18 2006::Least angle regression+Efron, B; Hastie, T; Johnstone, I; et al.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+APR 2004::A STATISTICAL VIEW OF SOME CHEMOMETRICS REGRESSION TOOLS+FRANK, IE; FRIEDMAN, JH+TECHNOMETRICS+MAY 1993::ADAPTIVE LASSO FOR SPARSE HIGH-DIMENSIONAL REGRESSION MODELS+Huang, Jian; Ma, Shuangge; Zhang, Cun-Hui+STATISTICA SINICA+OCT 2008::KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes+Kanehisa, M; Goto, S+NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH+JAN 1 2000::On the degrees of freedom in shrinkage estimation+Kato, Kengo+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+AUG 2009::no title+Kaufman, L.; Rousseeuw, P.+Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis+1990::Blockwise sparse regression+Kim, Y; Kim, J; Kim, Y+STATISTICA SINICA+APR 2006::Asymptotics for Lasso-type estimators+Knight, K; Fu, WJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 2000::ASYMPTOTICS FOR LEAST ABSOLUTE DEVIATION REGRESSION-ESTIMATORS+POLLARD, D+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 1991::Regulation of gene expression in the mammalian eye and its relevance to eye disease+Scheetz, Todd E.; Kim, Kwang-Youn A.; Swiderski, Ruth E.; et al.+PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA+SEP 26 2006::ESTIMATING DIMENSION OF A MODEL+SCHWARZ, G+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::Regression shrinkage and selection via the Lasso+Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Convergence and sparsity of Lasso and group Lasso in high-dimensional generalized linear models+Wang, Lichun; You, Yuan; Lian, Heng+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2015::On measuring and correcting the effects of data mining and model selection+Ye, JM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1998::Model selection and estimation in regression with grouped variables+Yuan, M; Lin, Y+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::THE COMPOSITE ABSOLUTE PENALTIES FAMILY FOR GROUPED AND HIERARCHICAL VARIABLE SELECTION+Zhao, Peng; Rocha, Guilherme; Yu, Bin+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+DEC 2009::The F-infinity-norm support vector machine+Zou, Hui; Yuan, Ming+STATISTICA SINICA+JAN 2008"

The impact of estimation uncertainty on covariate effects in nonlinear models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0802-7,SEP 2018,11,0,"Covariate effects are a key consideration in model evaluation, forecasting, and policy analysis, yet their dependence on estimation uncertainty has been largely overlooked in previous work. We discuss several approaches to covariate effect evaluation in nonlinear models, examine computational and reporting issues, and illustrate the practical implications of ignoring estimation uncertainty in a simulation study and applications to educational attainment and crime. The evidence reveals that failing to consider estimation variability and relying solely on parameter point estimates may lead to nontrivial biases in covariate effects that can be exacerbated in certain settings, underscoring the pivotal role that estimation uncertainty can play in this context.","Covariate effect,Discrete data,Marginal effect,Nonlinear model,Partial effect",,"Jeliazkov, Ivan@Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA::Vossmeyer, Angela@Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, 500 E Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA","Jeliazkov, Ivan@University of California System@University of California Irvine::Vossmeyer, Angela@Claremont Graduate School@Claremont McKenna College",not exist,"no title+Brownstone, D.+Discrete choice modeling for transportation.

Chernoff distance for conditionally specified models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0804-5,SEP 2018,37,1,"Recently, Nair et al. (Stat Pap 52:893-909, 2011) studied Chernoff distance for truncated distributions in univariate setup. The present paper addresses the question of extending the concept of Chernoff distance to bivariate setup with focus on residual as well as past lifetimes. This measure is extended to conditionally specified models of two components having possibly different ages or failed at different time instants. We provide some bounds using likelihood ratio order and investigate several properties of conditional Chernoff distance. The effect of monotone transformation on this conditional measure has also been examined. Moreover, we study conditional Chernoff distance in context of weighted model.","Chernoff distance,Conditionally specified model,Conditional proportional (reversed) hazard rate model,Likelihood ratio order,Weighted model","FAILURE TIME DATA,DIVERGENCE MEASURES,INFORMATION,DISTRIBUTIONS,ENTROPY,LIFETIMES","Ghosh, Amit@Rajiv Gandhi Inst Petr Technol, Dept Math, Rae Bareli 229316, India::Kundu, Chanchal@Rajiv Gandhi Inst Petr Technol, Dept Math, Rae Bareli 229316, India","Ghosh, Amit@Unknow::Kundu, Chanchal@Unknow",not exist,"Distance, discrimination et rsum exhaustif+Adhikari, BP; Joshi, DD.+Pubis Inst Starist Unie Paris+1956::ON DYNAMIC MUTUAL INFORMATION FOR BIVARIATE LIFETIMES+Ahmadi, Jafar; Di Crescenzo, Antonio; Longobardi, Maria+ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY+DEC 2015::A GENERAL CLASS OF COEFFICIENTS OF DIVERGENCE OF 1 DISTRIBUTION FROM ANOTHER+ALI, SM; SILVEY, SD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1966::no title+Arnold, B.

Classical and Bayesian estimation of reliability in a multicomponent stress-strength model based on a general class of inverse exponentiated distributions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0810-7,SEP 2018,35,0,"A s-out-of-k : G system consists of k components functions if and only if at least s components functions. In this paper, we consider the s-out-of-k : G system when this system is exposed a common random stress and the underlying distributions belong to the family of inverse exponentiated distributions. The estimates of this sytem reliability are investigated by using classical and Bayesian approaches. The uniformly minimum variance unbiased and exact Bayes estimates of the reliability of system are obtained analytically when the common second parameter is known. The Bayes estimates for the reliability of system have been developed by using Lindley's approximation and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method due to the lack of explicit forms when the all parameters are unknown. The asymptotic confidence interval and coverage probabilities are derived based on the Fisher's information matrix. The highest probability density credible interval is constructed by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The comparison of the derived estimates are carried out by using Monte Carlo simulations. Real data set is also analysed for an illustration of the findings.","s-out-of-k,G system,Stress-strength model,Multicomponent,reliability,General class of inverse exponentiated distributions,Bayes estimation",RAYLEIGH DISTRIBUTION,"Kizilaslan, Fatih@Marmara Univ, Dept Stat, Istanbul, Turkey","Kizilaslan, Fatih@Marmara University",not exist,"Statistical inferences for stress-strength in the proportional hazard models based on progressive Type-II censored samples+Basirat, M.; Baratpour, S.; Ahmadi, Jafar+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+FEB 11 2015::ESTIMATION OF RELIABILITY IN A MULTICOMPONENT STRESS-STRENGTH MODEL+BHATTACHARYYA, GK; JOHNSON, RA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1974::A DISTRIBUTION-FREE UPPER CONFIDENCE BOUND FOR PR (Y LESS-THAN X), BASED ON INDEPENDENT SAMPLES OF X AND Y+BIRNBAUM, ZW; MCCARTY, RC+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1958::On a use of Mann-Whitney statistics+Birnbaum, ZW.+P 3 BERK S MATH STAT+1956::Monte Carlo estimation of Bayesian credible and HPD intervals+Chen, MH; Shao, QM+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS+MAR 1999::On progressively censored generalized inverted exponential distribution+Dey, Sanku; Dey, Tanujit+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+2014::Multivariate stress-strength reliability model and its evaluation for coherent structures+Eryilmaz, Serkan+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 2008::On system reliability in stress-strength setup+Eryilmaz, Serkan+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+MAY 1 2010::no title+Gelman, A; Carlin, JB; Stern, HS.+Bayesian data analysis+2003::Likelihood estimation for a general class of inverse exponentiated distributions based on complete and progressively censored data+Ghitany, M.

Towards a better understanding of the dual representation of phi divergences,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0812-5,SEP 2018,44,1,"The aim of this paper is to study different estimation procedures based on phi-divergences. The dual representation of phi-divergences based on the Fenchel-Legendre duality provides a way to estimate phi-divergences by a simple plug-in of the empirical distribution without any smoothing technique. Resulting estimators are thoroughly studied theoretically and with simulations showing that the so called minimum phi-divergence estimator is generally non robust and behaves similarly to the maximum likelihood estimator. We give some arguments supporting the non robustness property, and give insights on how to modify the classical approach. An alternative class of robust estimators based on the dual representation of phi-divergences is introduced. We study consistency and robustness properties from an influence function point of view of the new estimator. In a second part, we invoke the Basu-Lindsay approach for approximating phi-divergences and provide a comparison between these approaches. The so called dual phi-divergence is also discussed and compared to our new estimator. A full simulation study of all these approaches is given in order to compare efficiency and robustness of all mentioned estimators against the so-called minimum density power divergence, showing encouraging results in favor of our new class of minimum dual phi-divergences.","Robust estimator,Fenchel duality,phi-divergence,Kernel density estimation,Mixture model","MINIMUM HELLINGER DISTANCE,NONPARAMETRIC DENSITY-ESTIMATION,MULTIVARIATE BOUNDED DATA,EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES,DISPARITY ESTIMATION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,ESTIMATORS,ROBUSTNESS,EFFICIENCY,DERIVATIVES","Al Mohamad, Diaa@Lab Stat Theor & Appl, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France","Al Mohamad, Diaa@Sorbonne Universite",not exist,"Towards a better understanding of the dual representation of phi divergences+Al Mohamad, D.+arxiv: 1506. 02166+2015::A GENERAL CLASS OF COEFFICIENTS OF DIVERGENCE OF 1 DISTRIBUTION FROM ANOTHER+ALI, SM; SILVEY, SD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1966::APPROXIMATION OF DENSITY-FUNCTIONS BY SEQUENCES OF EXPONENTIAL-FAMILIES+BARRON, AR; SHEU, CH+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1991::MINIMUM DISPARITY ESTIMATION FOR CONTINUOUS MODELS - EFFICIENCY, DISTRIBUTIONS AND ROBUSTNESS+BASU, A; LINDSAY, BG+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+DEC 1994::Robust and efficient estimation by minimising a density power divergence+Basu, A; Harris, IR; Hjort, NL; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ROBUSTNESS AND EFFICIENCY AND THE EFFECT OF MODEL SMOOTHING IN MINIMUM DISPARITY INFERENCE+BASU, A; SARKAR, S+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+1994::MINIMUM HELLINGER DISTANCE ESTIMATES FOR PARAMETRIC MODELS+BERAN, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1977::Semiparametric Two-Component Mixture Model with a Known Component: an Asymptotically Normal Estimator+Bordes, L.; Vandekerkhove, P.+MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF STATISTICS+MAR 2010::Consistency of asymmetric kernel density estimators and smoothed histograms with application to income data+Bouezmarni, T; Scaillet, O+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+APR 2005::Nonparametric density estimation for multivariate bounded data+Bouezmarni, Taoufik; Rombouts, Jeroen V.

Incoherent dose-escalation in phase I trials using the escalation with overdose control approach,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0790-7,JUN 2018,22,0,"A desirable property of any dose-escalation strategy for phase I oncology trials is coherence: if the previous patient experienced a toxicity, a higher dose is not recommended for the next patient; similarly, if the previous patient did not experience a toxicity, a lower dose is not recommended for the next patient. The escalation with overdose control (EWOC) approach is a model-based design that has been applied in practice, under which the dose assigned to the next patient is the one that, given all available data, has a posterior probability of exceeding the maximum tolerated dose equal to a pre-specified value known as the feasibility bound. Several methodological and applied publications have considered the EWOC approach with both feasibility bounds fixed and increasing throughout the trial. Whilst the EWOC approach with fixed feasibility bound has been proven to be coherent, some proposed methods of increasing the feasibility bound regardless of toxicity outcomes of patients can lead to incoherent dose-escalation. This paper formalises a proof that incoherent dose-escalation can occur if the feasibility bound is increased without consideration of preceding toxicity outcomes, and shows via simulation studies that only small increases in the feasibility bound are required for incoherent dose-escalations to occur.","Bayesian statistics,Dose-escalation,Adaptive designs,Maximum tolerated dose,Phase I trials,Coherence","CANCER CLINICAL-TRIALS,DESIGNS,EWOC","Wheeler, Graham M.@Cambridge Inst Publ Hlth, MRC Biostat Unit Hub Trials Methodol Res, Cambridge CB2 0SR, England@UCL, Canc Res UK, 90 Tottenham Court Rd, London W1T 4TJ, England@UCL, Canc Trials Ctr, 90 Tottenham Court Rd, London W1T 4TJ, England","Wheeler, Graham M.@University of London@Cancer Research UK@MRC Biostatistics Unit@University College London@University of Cambridge",not exist,"Cancer phase I clinical trials: Efficient dose escalation with overdose control+Babb, J; Rogatko, A; Zacks, S+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+MAY 30 1998::Patient specific dosing in a cancer phase I clinical trial+Babb, JS; Rogatko, A+STATISTICS IN MEDICINE+JUL 30 2001::Bayesian methods for phase I cancer clinical trials+Babb, JS; Rogatko, A.+ADV CLIN TRIAL BIOST+2004::Incorporating Individual and Collective Ethics into Phase I Cancer Trial Designs+Bartroff, Jay; Lai, Tze Leung+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2011::Study design principles for the clinical evaluation of new drugs as developed by the chemotherapy programme of the National Cancer Institute+Carter, S.

Statistical inference for heteroscedastic semi-varying coefficient EV models under restricted condition,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0773-8,JUN 2018,17,0,"This paper studies the estimation and testing problems for a class of heteroscedastic semi-varying coefficient errors-in-variables models under additional restricted condition. Initial restricted estimates for the regression coefficients and varying coefficients are first constructed based on the profile least squares procedure without considering the heteroscedasticity, then a bias-corrected kernel type restricted estimate for the variance function is proposed, which in turn is used to construct re-weighted bias-corrected restricted estimates of the regression coefficients and the varying coefficients. The large sample properties including the consistency and asymptotic normality are thoroughly investigated. To test hypotheses on the parametric component, we propose a test statistic based on the profile Lagrange multiplier, and show that its asymptotic null distribution is standard chi-squared distribution. Some simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.","Semi-varying coefficient EV model,Heteroscedasticity,Restricted estimator,Corrected profile Lagrange multiplier test statistic","IN-VARIABLES MODELS,PARTIALLY LINEAR-MODELS,EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD,ERRORS","Shi, Jianhong@Shanxi Normal Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Linfen 041000, Peoples R China::Zhao, Fanrong@Shanxi Normal Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Linfen 041000, Peoples R China","Shi, Jianhong@Shanxi Normal University::Zhao, Fanrong@Shanxi Normal University",not exist,"no title+Cheng, C.; Van Ness, J.W.+Statistical Regression with Measurement Error+1999::Empirical likelihood confidence region for parameters in semi-linear errors-in-variables models+Cui, HJ; Kong, EF+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+MAR 2006::Profile likelihood inferences on semiparametric varying-coefficient partially linear models+Fan, JQ; Huang, T+BERNOULLI+DEC 2005::no title+Fuller, W.

Distribution under elliptical symmetry of a distance-based multivariate coefficient of variation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0777-4,JUN 2018,24,1,"In the univariate setting, the coefficient of variation is widely used to measure the relative dispersion of a random variable with respect to its mean. Several extensions of the univariate coefficient of variation to the multivariate setting have been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we focus on a distance-based multivariate coefficient of variation. First, some real examples are discussed to motivate the use of the considered multivariate dispersion measure. Then, the asymptotic distribution of several estimators is analyzed under elliptical symmetry and used to construct approximate parametric confidence intervals that are compared with non-parametric intervals in a simulation study. Under normality, the exact distribution of the classical estimator is derived. As this natural estimator is biased, some bias corrections are proposed and compared by means of simulations.","Multivariate coefficient of variation,Bias reduction,Decentralized F-distribution,Elliptical symmetry,Sharpe Ratio","T-DISTRIBUTION,TESTS","Aerts, S.@Univ Liege ULg, HEC ULg, N1,Rue Louvrex 14, B-4000 Liege, Belgium::Haesbroeck, G.@Univ Liege ULg, Dept Math, Zone Polytech 1,Allee Decouverte 12, B-4000 Liege, Belgium::Ruwet, C.@Haute Ecole Prov Liege, Serv Math, 6 Quai Gloesner, B-4020 Liege, Belgium","Aerts, S.@University of Liege::Haesbroeck, G.@University of Liege::Ruwet, C.@Unknow",not exist,"Multivariate coefficients of variation: Comparison and influence functions+Aerts, S.; Haesbroeck, G.; Ruwet, C.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+DEC 2015::A novel definition of the multivariate coefficient of variation+Albert, Adelin; Zhang, Lixin+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+OCT 2010::Trial-to-trial variance in choice reaction time as a measure of the effect of stimulants during sleep deprivation+Babkoff, H; Kelly, TL; Naitoh, P+MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY+2001::On multivariate coefficients of variation+Bennett, BM.+Stat Papers+1977::Monitoring the Coefficient of Variation Using Control Charts with Run Rules+Castagliola, Philippe; Achouri, Au; Taleb, Hassen; et al.+QUALITY TECHNOLOGY AND QUANTITATIVE MANAGEMENT+MAR 2013::no title+Efron, B.; Tibshirani, R.; Tibshirani, R.

Prediction of future generalized order statistics based on exponential distribution with random sample size,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0779-2,JUN 2018,34,0,"In this paper we develop two pivotal quantities to construct prediction intervals for future two-parameter exponential lifetimes based on a random number of generalized order statistics (gOs) under a general set-up including progressive type II censored order statistics (pOs) with general scheme. Moreover, the expected value as well as the mean square error for the upper limit of predictive confidence interval (PCI) are obtained. Furthermore, a maximum likelihood predictor (MLP) for future exponential lifetimes is derived when the sample size is deterministic or random. Finally, a simulation study and an application to real data illustrate and corroborate the theoretical results.","Generalized order statistics,Random sample size,Predictive interval,Probability coverage,Predictive maximum likelihood function,Mean square error,Monte Carlo simulation",INTERVALS,"Barakat, H.

Sparse factor regression via penalized maximum likelihood estimation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0781-8,JUN 2018,36,0,"In factor regression model, the maximum likelihood estimation suffers from three disadvantages: (i) the maximum likelihood estimates are unavailable when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations, (ii) the rotation technique based on maximum likelihood estimates produces an insufficiently sparse loading matrix, and (iii) multicollinearity can occur when the estimates of unique variances (specific variances) are small because the regression coefficients are sensitive to the inverse of unique variances. To handle these problems, we propose a penalized maximum likelihood procedure. Specifically, we impose a lasso-type penalty on the factor loadings to improve the sparseness of the solution. We also introduce a penalty on unique variances, which (given the factor scores) corresponds to the ridge penalty on the regression coefficient. Theoretical properties from a prediction viewpoint of our procedure are discussed. The effectiveness of the procedure is investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. The utility of our procedure is demonstrated on real data collected by an online questionnaire.","Coordinate descent algorithm,Lasso,Multicollinearity,Penalized maximum likelihood estimation,Rotation technique","PREDICTION ERROR PROPERTY,VARIABLE SELECTION,COORDINATE DESCENT,IMPROPER SOLUTIONS,LASSO ESTIMATOR,REGULARIZATION,ALGORITHMS,DIMENSION,ROTATION,MODELS","Hirose, Kei@Kyushu Univ, Inst Math Ind, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan::Imada, Miyuki@NTT Network Innovat Labs, 3-9-11 Midori Cho, Musashino, Tokyo 1808585, Japan","Hirose, Kei@Kyushu University::Imada, Miyuki@Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation",not exist,"FACTOR-ANALYSIS AND AIC+AKAIKE, H+PSYCHOMETRIKA+SEP 1987::THE EFFECT OF SAMPLING ERROR ON CONVERGENCE, IMPROPER SOLUTIONS, AND GOODNESS-OF-FIT INDEXES FOR MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS+ANDERSON, JC; GERBING, DW+PSYCHOMETRIKA+1984::Statistical inference in factor analysis+Anderson, T.W.; Rubin, H.+P 3 BERK S MATH STAT+1956::STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF FACTOR MODELS OF HIGH DIMENSION+Bai, Jushan; Li, Kunpeng+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+FEB 2012::SIMULTANEOUS ANALYSIS OF LASSO AND DANTZIG SELECTOR+Bickel, Peter J.; Ritov, Ya'acov; Tsybakov, Alexandre B.+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2009::no title+Bishop, CM.+Pattern recognition and machine learning+2006::COORDINATE DESCENT ALGORITHMS FOR NONCONVEX PENALIZED REGRESSION, WITH APPLICATIONS TO BIOLOGICAL FEATURE SELECTION+Breheny, Patrick; Huang, Jian+ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS+MAR 2011::High-Dimensional Sparse Factor Modeling: Applications in Gene Expression Genomics+Carvalho, Carlos M.; Chang, Jeffrey; Lucas, Joseph E.; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2008::A penalized maximum likelihood approach to sparse factor analysis+Choi, Jang; Zou, Hui; Oehlert, Gary+STATISTICS AND ITS INTERFACE+2010::Sparse partial least squares regression for simultaneous dimension reduction and variable selection+Chun, Hyonho; Keles, Suenduez+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2010::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent+Friedman, Jerome; Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Rob+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+FEB 2010::PROMAX - A QUICK METHOD FOR ROTATION TO OBLIQUE SIMPLE STRUCTURE+HENDRICKSON, AE; WHITE, PO+BRITISH JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY+1964::Bayesian information criterion and selection of the number of factors in factor analysis models+Hirose, K.; Kawano, S.; Konishi, S.<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Ichikawa, M</span>.+J.

Under suitable assumptions, we investigate the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators and prove the EL ratio statistics has a standard chi-squared limiting distribution.

Estimation of parameters of Weibull-Gamma distribution based on progressively censored data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0787-2,JUN 2018,35,0,"In this paper, the estimation of parameters of a three-parameter Weibull-Gamma distribution based on progressively type-II right censored sample is studied. The maximum likelihood, Bayes, and parametric bootstrap methods are used for estimating the unknown parameters as well as some lifetime parameters reliability function, hazard function and coefficient of variation. Approximate confidence intervals for the unknown parameters as well as reliability function, hazard function and coefficient of variation are constructed based on the s-normal approximation to the asymptotic distribution of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs), and log-transformed MLEs. In addition, two bootstrap CIs are also proposed. Bayes estimates of the unknown parameters and the corresponding credible intervals are obtained by using the Gibbs within Metropolis-Hasting samplers procedure. Furthermore, the results of Bayes method are obtained under both the balanced squared error loss and balanced linear-exponential loss. Analysis of a simulated data set has also been presented for illustrative purposes. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to investigate the precision of the Bayes estimates with MLEs and two bootstrap estimates, also to compare the performance of different corresponding CIs considered.","Weibull-Gamma distribution,Progressive type-II censoring,Maximum likelihood estimators,Bootstrap methods,Markov chain Monte Carlo technique","BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION,GENERAL-CLASS,MODEL,SAMPLES,SIMULATION,INFERENCE,INTERVALS,TESTS","EL-Sagheer, Rashad M.@Al Azhar Univ, Fac Sci, Math Dept, Cairo 11884, Egypt","EL-Sagheer, Rashad M.@Al Azhar University",not exist,"Some properties of progressive censored order statistics from arbitrary and uniform distributions with applications to inference and simulation+Aggarwala, R; Balakrishnan, N+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 1998::Bayes estimation based on k-record data from a general class of distributions under balanced type loss functions+Ahmadi, Jafar; Jozani, Mohammad Jafari; Marchand, Eric; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAR 1 2009::Point and interval estimation for a generalized logistic distribution under progressive Type II censoring+Asgharzadeh, A.+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2006::A SIMPLE SIMULATIONAL ALGORITHM FOR GENERATING PROGRESSIVE TYPE-II CENSORED SAMPLES+BALAKRISHNAN, N; SANDHU, RA+AMERICAN STATISTICIAN+MAY 1995::On the distribution of a test for exponentiality based on progressively Type-II right censored spacings+Balakrishnan, N; Lin, CT+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+APR 2003::no title+Balakrishnan, N; Aggarwala, R.+Progressive Censoring: Theory, Methods, and Applications+2000::Progressive censoring methodology: an appraisal+Balakrishnan, N.+TEST+AUG 2007::Estimation for the three-parameter lognormal distribution based on progressively censored data+Basak, Prasanta; Basak, Indrani; Balakrishnan, N.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+AUG 1 2009::BAYESIAN-APPROACH TO LIFE TESTING AND RELIABILITY ESTIMATION USING ASYMMETRIC LOSS FUNCTION+BASU, AP; EBRAHIMI, N+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+SEP-OCT 1991::Weibull-gamma composite distribution: alternative multipath/shadowing fading model+Bithas, P.

Distribution-free comparisons of residual lifetimes of coherent systems based on copula properties,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0789-0,JUN 2018,24,5,"In this paper a general procedure is proposed to get stochastic comparisons of residual lifetimes of coherent systems. The comparison results obtained are based on the structure of the system and on properties of the copula used to describe the dependence between the component lifetimes. They are distribution-free with respect to the component lifetime distributions. We consider two system residual lifetimes at a given time t > 0. In the first one, we just assume that the system is working at time t while, in the second one, we assume that all the components are working at time t. We study the main stochastic orderings: hazard rate, stochastic, mean residual life and likelihood ratio orders. Specific results are obtained in the particular case of independent components and in the case of identically distributed components. Some illustrative examples are included. They prove that, in some cases, these system residual lifetimes are not ordered. Even more, surprisingly, sometimes the first residual lifetime is greater (in some stochastic sense) than the second one under a given dependence model.","Reliability,Coherent systems,Residual lifetimes,Stochastic orderings,Copula","STOCHASTIC COMPARISONS,PARALLEL SYSTEMS,LIFE FUNCTIONS,COMPONENTS,REPRESENTATIONS,RELIABILITY","Navarro, Jorge@Univ Murcia, Fac Matemat, E-30100 Murcia, Spain","Navarro, Jorge@University of Murcia",not exist,"The mean residual life function of a k-out-of-n structure at the system level+Asadi, M; Bayramoglu, I+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+JUN 2006::Statistical Theory of Reliability and Lite Testing+Barlow, R.E.; Proschan, F.+INT SERIES DECISION+1975::no title+Durante, F.; Sempi, C.+Principles of Copula Theory+2015::On residual lifetime of coherent systems after the rth failure+Eryilmaz, Serkan+STATISTICAL PAPERS+FEB 2013::Stochastic comparisons of residual lifetimes and inactivity times of coherent systems with dependent identically distributed components+Gupta, Nitin; Misra, Neeraj; Kumar, Somesh+EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH+JAN 16 2015::Parallel and k-out-of-n: G systems with nonidentical components and their mean residual life functions+Gurler, Selma; Bairamov, Ismihan+APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING+FEB 2009::Continuous Multivariate Distributions+Kotz, S.; Balakrishnan, N.; Johnson, N.L.+Models and Applications+2000::On used systems and systems with used components+Li, X.; Pellerey, F.; You, Y.+Stochastic orders in Reliability and Risk, In Honor of Professor Moshe Shaked+2013::Stochastic comparisons on residual life and inactivity time of series and parallel systems+Li, XH; Lu, JY+PROBABILITY IN THE ENGINEERING AND INFORMATIONAL SCIENCES+2003::Comparisons in the mean residual life order of coherent systems with identically distributed components+Navarro, Jorge; Gomis, M.

A simulation study is conducted to access the performance of the proposed estimators and recommendations are made on the basis of simulation results. A real data set is also analyzed in detail for an illustration purpose. Finally, by making use of expected Fisher information matrix various inspection times and optimal censoring schemes are obtained.","Bayes estimate,EM algorithm,Fisher information matrix,Inspection time,Optimal censoring,Probability plot","GENERALIZED EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION,PLANNING LIFE TESTS,LOGNORMAL-DISTRIBUTION,BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION,MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,RANDOM REMOVALS,INFERENCE,PREDICTION,FAILURE,PLANS","Singh, Sukhdev@Indian Inst Technol Patna, Dept Math, Patna, Bihar, India::Tripathi, Yogesh Mani@Indian Inst Technol Patna, Dept Math, Patna, Bihar, India","Singh, Sukhdev@Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System)@Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Patna::Tripathi, Yogesh Mani@Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System)@Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Patna","Singh, Sukhdev@G-5919-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6282-4281","On optimum aggregation of income distribution data+Aggarwal, V.+Sankhya: Indian J Stat Ser B+1984::Progressive interval censoring: Some mathematical results with applications to inference+Aggarwala, R+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2001::Statistical analysis of exponentiated Weibull family under type I progressive interval with random removals+Ashour, S.

SYMARMA: a new dynamic model for temporal data on conditional symmetric distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0753-z,MAR 2018,22,0,"Gaussian models of time series, ARMA, have been widely used in the literature. Benjamin et al. (J Am Stat Assoc 98:214-223, 2003) extended these models to the exponential family distributions. Also in that direction, Rocha and Cribari-Neto (Test 18:529-545, 2009) proposed a time series model for the class of beta distributions. In this paper, we develop an autoregressive and moving average symmetric model, named SYMARMA, which is a dynamic model for random variables belonging to the class of symmetric distributions including also a set of regressors. We discuss methods for parameter estimation, hypothesis testing and forecasting. In particular, we provide closed-form expressions for the score function and Fisher information matrix. Robust study is presented based on influence function. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate the consistency and asymptotic normality of the conditional maximum likelihood estimator for the model parameters. An application with real data is presented and discussed.","Conditional maximum likelihood,Outlier,Symmetric distributions,Time series","LINEAR-REGRESSION MODELS,MOVING AVERAGE MODELS,TIME-SERIES MODELS","Maior, Vinicius Q.

Given a sample set of independent identically distributed variables, we want to estimate H(.) from this sample set. The present work has two goals. The first one is to propose an estimator of a cdf based on an orthogonal trigonometric series and to give its statistical and asymptotic proprieties (bias, variance, mean square error, mean integrated squared error, convergence of the bias, convergence of variance, convergence of the mean squared error, convergence of the mean integrated squared error, uniform convergence in probability and the rate of convergence of the mean integrated squared error). The second is to introduce a new method for the selection of a ""smoothing parameter"". The comparison by simulation between this method and Kronmal-Tarter's method, shows that the new method is more performant in the sense of the mean integrated square error.","Cumulative distribution and density,Trigonometric series,Orthogonal series,Kronmal and Tarter","DENSITY-ESTIMATION,TRIGONOMETRIC SERIES,PROBABILITY DENSITY,DISTRIBUTIONS,POLYNOMIALS,EXPANSIONS","Saadi, Nora@Univ Bejaia, LAMOS Lab, Bejaia, Algeria::Adjabi, Smail@Univ Bejaia, LAMOS Lab, Bejaia, Algeria::Gannoun, Ali@Univ Montpellier 2, Math & Modelling Inst Montpellier, Montpellier, France","Saadi, Nora@Universite de Bejaia::Adjabi, Smail@Universite de Bejaia::Gannoun, Ali@Universite de Montpellier@Languedoc-Roussillon Universites (ComUE)",not exist,"BANDWIDTH SELECTION FOR KERNEL DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION ESTIMATION+ALTMAN, N; LEGER, C+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+AUG 1 1995::Application of Bernstein Polynomials for smooth estimation of a distribution and density function+Babu, GJ; Canty, AJ; Chaubey, YP+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUL 1 2002::Estimation of distribution using orthogonal expansions+Bradford, R.+Ann Math Stat+1974::FITTING DENSITY-FUNCTIONS WITH POLYNOMIALS+BUCKLAND, ST+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS+1992::DISCRIMINATION WITH POLYCHOTOMOUS PREDICTOR VARIABLES USING ORTHOGONAL FUNCTIONS+BUTLER, WJ; KRONMAL, RA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1985::Evaluation of an unknown distribution density from observations+Cencov, N.+Dokl Soviet Math+1962::On smooth estimation of survival and density functions+Chaubey, Y.

Selected statistical methods of data analysis for multivariate functional data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0757-8,MAR 2018,41,1,"Data in the form of a continuous vector function on a given interval are referred to as multivariate functional data. These data are treated as realizations of multivariate random processes. The paper is devoted to three statistical dimension reduction techniques for multivariate data. For the first one, principal components analysis, the authors present a review of a recent paper (Jacques and Preda in, Comput Stat Data Anal, 71:92-106, 2014). For two others one, canonical variables and discriminant coordinates, the authors extend existing works for univariate functional data to multivariate. These methods for multivariate functional data are presented, illustrated and discussed in the context of analyzing real data sets. Each of these techniques is applied on real data set.","Multivariate functional data,Functional data analysis,Principal component analysis,Discriminant coordinates,Canonical correlation analysis","PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS,CLASSIFICATION,VARIABLES,CURVES","Gorecki, Tomasz@Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Umultowska 87, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland::Krzysko, Miroslaw@Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Umultowska 87, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland::Waszak, Lukasz@Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Umultowska 87, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland::Wolynski, Waldemar@Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Umultowska 87, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland","Gorecki, Tomasz@Adam Mickiewicz University::Krzysko, Miroslaw@Adam Mickiewicz University::Waszak, Lukasz@Adam Mickiewicz University::Wolynski, Waldemar@Adam Mickiewicz University","Gorecki, Tomasz@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9969-5257","Variable selection in infinite-dimensional problems+Aneiros, German; Vieu, Philippe+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+NOV 2014::Statistical Learning as a Regression Problem+Berk, Richard A.+STATISTICAL LEARNING FROM A REGRESSION PERSPECTIVE+2008::Principal components for multivariate functional data+Berrendero, J.

On stochastic comparisons for population age and remaining lifetime,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0759-6,MAR 2018,17,4,"First, we consider items that are incepted into operation having already a random (initial) age and define the corresponding remaining lifetime. We show that these random variables are identically distributed when the age distribution is equal to the equilibrium distribution of the renewal theory. Then we consider real populations of items that were incepted into operation (were born) at different instants of time and obtain some useful inequalities between the population age and the remaining lifetime using reasoning similar to that employed in population studies. We also discuss the aging properties of populations using different stochastic orders.","Equilibrium distribution,Random initial age,Stable population,Stationary population,Stochastic ordering",DISTRIBUTIONS,"Cha, Ji Hwan@Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 120750, South Korea::Finkelstein, Maxim@Univ Free State, Dept Math Stat, POB 339, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa@ITMO Univ, 49 Kronverkskiy Pr, St Petersburg 197101, Russia","Cha, Ji Hwan@Ewha Womans University::Finkelstein, Maxim@University of the Free State@ITMO University","Finkelstein, Maxim@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3018-8353","SOME GENERAL RELATIONSHIPS IN POPULATION-DYNAMICS+ARTHUR, WB; VAUPEL, JW+POPULATION INDEX+1984::On random age and remaining lifetime for populations of items+Finkelstein, Maxim; Vaupel, James+APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY+SEP-OCT 2015::Failure Rate Modelling for Reliability and Risk Introduction+Finkelstein, Maxim+FAILURE RATE MODELLING FOR RELIABILITY AND RISK+2008::On some comparisons of lifetimes for reliability analysis+Finkelstein, Maxim+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+NOV 2013::BATHTUB AND RELATED FAILURE RATE CHARACTERIZATIONS+GLASER, RE+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1980::On generalized orderings and aging properties with their implications+Hu, T; Kundu, A; Nanda, AK.+System and bayesian reliability+2001::STATISTICAL-INFERENCE IN THE LEXIS DIAGRAM+KEIDING, N+PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES+SEP 15 1990::Applied Mathematical Demography+Keyfitz, N; Caswell, H+APPLIED MATHEMATICAL DEMOGRAPHY+2005::Reversed hazard rate order of equilibrium distributions and a related aging notion+Li, Xiaohu; Xu, Maochao+STATISTICAL PAPERS+OCT 2008::Life Distributions: Structure of Nonparametric, Semiparametric, and Parametric Families+no author+LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS: STRUCTURE OF NONPARAMETRIC, SEMIPARAMETRIC, AND PARAMETRIC FAMILIES+2007::no title+Preston, S.

Bias-corrected quantile regression estimation of censored regression models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0761-z,MAR 2018,37,0,"In this paper, an extension of the indirect inference methodology to semiparametric estimation is explored in the context of censored regression. Motivated by weak small-sample performance of the censored regression quantile estimator proposed by Powell (J Econom 32:143-155, 1986a), two- and three-step estimation methods were introduced for estimation of the censored regression model under conditional quantile restriction. While those stepwise estimators have been proven to be consistent and asymptotically normal, their finite sample performance greatly depends on the specification of an initial estimator that selects the subsample to be used in subsequent steps. In this paper, an alternative semiparametric estimator is introduced that does not involve a selection procedure in the first step. The proposed estimator is based on the indirect inference principle and is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal under appropriate regularity conditions. Its performance is demonstrated and compared to existing methods by means of Monte Carlo simulations.","Asymptotic normality,Censored regression,Indirect inference,Quantile regression","LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATION,NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION","Cizek, P.@Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & OR, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands::Sadikoglu, S.@Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & OR, Tilburg, Netherlands","Cizek, P.@Tilburg University::Sadikoglu, S.@Tilburg University",not exist,"Quantile regression under misspecification, with an application to the US wage structure+Angrist, J; Chernozhukov, V; Fernandez-Val, I+ECONOMETRICA+MAR 2006::AN INVESTIGATION OF THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE TOBIT ESTIMATOR TO NON-NORMALITY+ARABMAZAR, A; SCHMIDT, P+ECONOMETRICA+1982::An alternative estimator for the censored quantile regression model+Buchinsky, M; Hahn, JY+ECONOMETRICA+MAY 1998::MEDIAN UNBIASEDNESS OF ESTIMATORS OF PANEL-DATA CENSORED REGRESSION-MODELS+CAMPBELL, JR; HONORE, BE+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+SEP 1993::Three-step censored quantile regression and extramarital affairs+Chernozhukov, V; Hong, H+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 2002::Bias-corrected quantile regression estimation of censored regression models+Cizek, P; Sadikoglu, S.+CentER Discussion Paper 60/ 2014+2014::Least trimmed squares in nonlinear regression under dependence+Cizek, Pavel+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 1 2006::Loafing or learning? - the demand for informal education+Fahr, R+EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW+JAN 2005::Computational aspects of censored quantile regression+Fitzenberger, B+L(1)-STATISTICAL PROCEDURES AND RELATED TOPICS+1997::A guide to censored quantile regressions+Fitzenberger, B.+HANDB STAT+1997::Improving the computation of censored quantile regressions+Fitzenberger, Bernd; Winker, Peter+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+SEP 15 2007::Calibration by simulation for small sample bias correction+Gouridroux, C.; Renault, E.; Touzi, N.+Simulation-based Inference in Econometrics: Methods and Applications+2000::INDIRECT INFERENCE+GOURIEROUX, C; MONFORT, A; RENAULT, E+JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS+DEC 1993::Indirect inference for dynamic panel models+Gourieroux, Christian; Phillips, Peter C.

Linear mixed model with Laplace distribution (LLMM),STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0763-x,MAR 2018,45,0,"Linear mixed modeling (LMM) is a comprehensive technique used for clustered, panel and longitudinal data. The main assumption of classical LMM is having normally distributed random effects and error terms. However, there are several situations for that we need to use heavier tails distributions than the (multivariate) normal to handle outliers and/or heavy tailness in data. In this study, we focus on LMM using the multivariate Laplace distribution which is known as the heavy tailed alternative to the normal distribution. The parameter estimators of interest are generated with EM algorithm for the proposed model. A simulation study is provided to illustrate the performance of the Laplace distribution over the normal distribution for LMM. Also, a real data example is used to explore the behavior of the proposed estimators over the counterparts.","Laplace,Mixed models,Robust distributions,EM,Orthodont","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,LONGITUDINAL DATA,T-DISTRIBUTION,EM ALGORITHM,REGRESSION","Yavuz, Fulya Gokalp@Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Stat, TR-34220 Istanbul, Turkey::Arslan, Olcay@Ankara Univ, Dept Stat, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey","Yavuz, Fulya Gokalp@Yildiz Technical University::Arslan, Olcay@Ankara University","Arslan, Olcay@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7067-4997","Skew-normal linear mixed models.+Arellano-Valle, R.

Randomized response techniques for a multi-level attribute using a single sensitive question,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0764-9,MAR 2018,32,0,"Collecting reliable responses to sensitive survey questions is challenging, since respondents may be more likely to refuse to respond or to provide biased responses. To address these challenges, Warner (J Am Stat Assoc 60:63-69, 1965) pioneered the randomized response (RR) technique to estimate proportions of individuals in a population with either of two possible attributes. The RR technique can overcome non-response and underreporting biases because it doesn't reveal the respondent's attribute, and a generalization of the random component of the response by Christofides (Metrika 57:195-200, 2003) improves estimation properties. In this study, we develop a new RR model to estimate proportions of individuals with each of multiple categories of an attribute using a single sensitive question by means of only one randomization device based on Christofides's (Metrika 57:195-200, 2003) model. Under the proposed model, a respondent reports the absolute difference between an integer associated with his or her attribute and a random integer. In a part of this research, we conduct a simulation study of the relative efficiency of the proposed methods. The technique is illustrated using data from the 2012 Family and Gender Module of the Taiwan Social Change Survey to estimate the proportions of individuals of different sexual orientations, and the results are compared with the results of direct inquiry from the same survey.","Multiple categories,Randomized response technique,Christofides model,Taiwan social change survey,sexual orientation","CATEGORICAL-DATA,EXTENSION,DESIGNS,MODEL","Hsieh, Shu-Hui@Acad Sinica, Survey Res Ctr, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei, Taiwan::Lee, Shen-Ming@Feng Chia Univ, Dept Stat, Taichung, Taiwan::Tu, Su-Hao@Acad Sinica, Survey Res Ctr, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei, Taiwan","Hsieh, Shu-Hui@Academia Sinica - Taiwan::Lee, Shen-Ming@Feng Chia University::Tu, Su-Hao@Academia Sinica - Taiwan",not exist,"A MULTI-PROPORTIONS RANDOMIZED RESPONSE MODEL+ABULELA, ALA; GREENBER.BG; HORVITZ, DG+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1967::A randomized response procedure for multiple-sensitive questions+Barabesi, Lucio; Franceschi, Sara; Marcheselli, Marzia+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2012::RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE MULTIVARIATE DESIGNS FOR CATEGORICAL-DATA+BOURKE, PD+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1982::ESTIMATING A DISTRIBUTION FOR EACH CATEGORY OF A SENSITIVE VARIATE+BOURKE, PD+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1990::ON THE ANALYSIS OF SOME MULTIVARIATE RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE DESIGNS FOR CATEGORICAL-DATA+BOURKE, PD+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+1981::Multi-proportions randomized response using the unrelated question+Bourke, PD.+Report No. 74 of the Errors in Survey Research Project+1974::A two-stage unrelated randomized response procedure+Chang, H.J.; Liang, D.H.+Australian Journal of Statistics+1996::The Franklin's randomized response model for two sensitive attributes+Chen, CC; Singh, S.+Sect Surv Res Methods+2009::Randomized response technique for two sensitive characteristics at the same time+Christofides, TC+METRIKA+SEP 2005::A generalized randomized response technique+Christofides, TC+METRIKA+2003::THEORY OF RANDOMIZED RESPONSES TO 2 SENSITIVE QUESTIONS+DRANE, W+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1976::UNIQUE CONSISTENT SOLUTION TO LIKELIHOOD EQUATIONS+FOUTZ, RV+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1977::A COMPARISON OF ESTIMATORS FOR RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE SAMPLING WITH CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS FROM A DICHOTOMOUS POPULATION+FRANKLIN, LA+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1989::A new randomized response model+Gjestvang, CR; Singh, S+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2006::UNRELATED QUESTION RANDOMIZED RESPONSE MODEL - THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK+GREENBERG, BG; ABULELA, ALA; SIMMONS, WR; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::The unrelated question randomized response model+Horvitz, D.G; Shah, B.V.; Simmons, W.R.+P SOC STAT SECT AM S+1967::An additive randomized response model+Kim, JI; Flueck, JA.+P SURVEY RES SECTION+1978::ASKING SENSITIVE QUESTIONS INDIRECTLY+KUK, AYC+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1990::Estimating at least seven measures of qualitative variables from a single sample using randomized response technique+Lee, Cheon-Sig; Sedory, Stephen A.; Singh, Sarjinder+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JAN 2013::Meta-analysis of randomized response research thirty-five years of validation+Lensvelt-Mulders, GJLM; Hox, JJ; van der Heuden, PGM; et al.+SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS &amp; RESEARCH+FEB 2005::AN ALTERNATIVE RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE PROCEDURE+MANGAT, NS; SINGH, R+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1990::AN IMPROVED RANDOMIZED-RESPONSE STRATEGY+MANGAT, NS+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1994::Reducing Socially Desirable Responses in Epidemiologic Surveys An Extension of the Randomized-response Technique+Moshagen, Morten; Musch, Jochen; Ostapczuk, Martin; et al.+EPIDEMIOLOGY+MAY 2010::Surveying Multiple Sensitive Attributes using an Extension of the Randomized-Response Technique+Moshagen, Morten; Musch, Jochen+INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH+WIN 2012::Inference on confidential characters from survey data+Mukherjee, R.+CALCUTTA STAT ASS B+1981::On the estimation of some confidential characters from survey+Mukhopadhyay, P.+Calcutta Stat Assoc Bull+1980::Sexual Orientation, Adult Connectedness, Substance Use, and Mental Health Outcomes Among Adolescents: Findings From the 2009 New York City Youth Risk Behavior Survey+Seil, Kacie S.; Desai, Mayur M.; Smith, Megan V.+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH+OCT 2014::On the generalized randomized response model with polychotomous variables+Silva, L.

Estimation of reliability in a multicomponent stress-strength model based on a bivariate Kumaraswamy distribution,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0765-8,MAR 2018,51,0,"In this paper, we consider a system which has k statistically independent and identically distributed strength components and each component is constructed by a pair of statistically dependent elements. These elements follow a bivariate Kumaraswamy distribution and each element is exposed to a common random stress T which follows a Kumaraswamy distribution. The system is regarded as operating only if at least s out of k strength variables exceed the random stress. The multicomponent reliability of the system is given by at least s of the exceed T) where , . We estimate by using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The Bayes estimates of have been developed by using Lindley's approximation and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods due to the lack of explicit forms. The uniformly minimum variance unbiased and exact Bayes estimates of are obtained analytically when the common second shape parameter is known. The asymptotic confidence interval and the highest probability density credible interval are constructed for . The reliability estimators are compared by using the estimated risks through Monte Carlo simulations.

"Global sensitivity analysis: a generalized, unbiased and optimal estimator of total-effect variance",STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0768-5,MAR 2018,56,0,"Variance-based sensitivity analysis and multivariate sensitivity analysis aim to apportion the variability of the model output(s) into input factors and their interactions. Sobol's total index, which accounts for the effects of interactions, serves as a practical tool to deal with the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we address the problem of the efficient estimation of Sobol's total index. First, we provide a generalized and optimal estimator of the variance of the total effect function, including Jansen's estimator, its rate of convergence, and its asymptotic distribution; second, we derive the asymptotic distribution of total indices; and third, we investigate the applicability of these results to allow for improving the estimation of the total indices for some specific degrees of the kernel.","Multivariate sensitivity analysis,Total sensitivity indices,U-statistics,Variance-based sensitivity analysis","GAUSSIAN QUADRATURE-RULES,POLYNOMIAL CHAOS,SOBOL INDEXES,MODEL OUTPUT,LINK","Lamboni, Matieyendou@Univ Guyane, Dept DFRST, Cayenne 97346, French Guiana@228 UMR Espace Dev, 275 Route Montabo, Cayenne 97323, French Guiana@EC Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21027 Ispra, Italy","Lamboni, Matieyendou@European Commission Joint Research Centre@EC JRC ISPRA Site",not exist,"no title+Abramowitz, M.; Stegun, I.+NBS APPL MATH SERIES+1965::Contribution to the sample mean plot for graphical and numerical sensitivity analysis+Bolado-Lavin, R.; Castaings, W.; Tarantola, S.+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+JUN 2009::Transformations and invariance in the sensitivity analysis of computer experiments+Borgonovo, E.; Tarantola, S.; Plischke, E.; et al.+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+NOV 2014::Global sensitivity analysis using sparse grid interpolation and polynomial chaos+Buzzard, Gregery T.+RELIABILITY ENGINEERING &amp; SYSTEM SAFETY+NOV 2012::Valuation of mortgage-backed securities using Brownian bridges to reduce effective dimension+Caflisch, R.E.; Morokoff, W.; Owen, A.B.+J.

Monitoring the ratio of population means of a bivariate normal distribution using CUSUM type control charts,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0769-4,MAR 2018,35,5,"Continuous surveillance of the ratio of population means of bivariate normal distributions is a quality control issue worth of consideration in several manufacturing and service-oriented companies. For this reason, some recent studies have investigated traditional and advanced Shewhart control charts to perform on-line monitoring of this kind of ratio. Anyway, Shewhart control charts are known to be insensitive to small and moderate shift sizes. Up to now, CUSUM control charts have not yet been considered for this quality control problem. In this paper, we propose and investigate the statistical properties of two Phase II one-sided CUSUM control charts for monitoring the ratio of population means of a bivariate normal distribution. Several figures and tables are provided to show the sensitivity of the two CUSUM charts to different deterministic shift sizes and their performance for the random shift size condition. In most cases, the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CUSUM control charts are very sensitive to shifts in the ratio. An illustrative example comments the use of these charts in a simulated quality control problem from the food industry.","Ratio distribution,Markov chain,CUSUM","2 NORMAL VARIABLES,RUN-LENGTH,SHIFT SIZES,EWMA,PERFORMANCE,PARAMETERS,VARIANCE,DESIGN","Kim Phuc Tran@Univ Nantes, LUNAM Univ, Nantes, France@CNRS, IRCCyN, UMR 6597, Nantes, France::Castagliola, Philippe@Univ Nantes, LUNAM Univ, Nantes, France@CNRS, IRCCyN, UMR 6597, Nantes, France::Celano, Giovanni@Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Catania, Italy","Kim Phuc Tran@Universite de Nantes@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Castagliola, Philippe@Universite de Nantes@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)::Celano, Giovanni@University of Catania","Celano, Giovanni@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7871-7499","A generalized multivariate beta distribution: control charting when the measurements are from an exponential distribution+Adamski, K.; Human, S.

Robust variable selection in high-dimensional varying coefficient models based on weighted composite quantile regression,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0736-5,DEC 2017,38,0,"In this paper, a new variable selection procedure based on weighted composite quantile regression is proposed for varying coefficient models with a diverging number of parameters. The proposed method is based on basis function approximation and the group SCAD penalty. The new estimation method can achieve both robustness and efficiency.

Finally, the finite sample behavior of the estimator is evaluated by simulation studies.

Bayesian analysis of penalized quantile regression for longitudinal data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0737-4,DEC 2017,19,2,This paper considers penalized quantile regression model for random effects longitudinal data from a Bayesian perspective. The introduction of a large number of individual random effects can significantly inflate the variability of estimates of other covariate effects. To modify this inflation effect a hierarchical Bayesian model is introduced to shrink the individual effects toward the common population values by using the Lasso and adaptive Lasso penalties in the quantile regression check function. A Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed to simulate the parameters from the posterior distributions. The simulation studies and real data analysis indicate that the proposed methods generally perform better in comparison to the other approaches.,"Asymmetric Laplace distribution,Bayesian quantile regression,Hierarchical models,Longitudinal data,Penalty methods,Random effects","ADAPTIVE LASSO,MODELS,SELECTION","Aghamohammadi, A.@Univ Zanjan, Dept Stat, Zanjan, Iran::Mohammadi, S.@Univ Zanjan, Dept Stat, Zanjan, Iran","Aghamohammadi, A.@Unknow::Mohammadi, S.@Unknow",not exist,"Bayesian adaptive Lasso quantile regression+Alhamzawi, Rahim; Yu, Keming; Benoit, Dries F.+STATISTICAL MODELLING+JUN 2012::SCALE MIXTURES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+ANDREWS, DF; MALLOWS, CL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1974::no title+[Anonymous].+R:A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing+2011::SOME TESTS OF SPECIFICATION FOR PANEL DATA - MONTE-CARLO EVIDENCE AND AN APPLICATION TO EMPLOYMENT EQUATIONS+ARELLANO, M; BOND, S+REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES+APR 1991::Non-Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-based models and some of their uses in financial economics+Barndorff-Nielsen, OE; Shephard, N+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+2001::Quantile regression for longitudinal data using the asymmetric Laplace distribution+Geraci, Marco; Bottai, Matteo+BIOSTATISTICS+JAN 2007::Quantile regression for longitudinal data+Koenker, R+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 2004::Goodness of fit and related inference processes for quantile regression+Koenker, R; Machado, JAF+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1999::no title+Koenker, R.+Quantile Regression+2005::Gibbs sampling methods for Bayesian quantile regression+Kozumi, Hideo; Kobayashi, Genya+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2011::Bayesian Lasso quantile regression for panel data models+Li, H; Luo, Y; Tian, M.+J Quant Tech Econ+2013::Study on adaptive Lasso quantile regression for panel data models+Li, Z; Tian, M; Luo, Y.+Stat Inform Forum+2014::Bayesian quantile regression for longitudinal data models+Luo, Youxi; Lian, Heng; Tian, Maozai+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION+2012::Regression shrinkage and selection via the Lasso+Tibshirani, R+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1996::Adaptive Lasso Variable Selection for the Accelerated Failure Models+Wang, Xiaoguang; Song, Lixin+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2011::Penalized weighted composite quantile estimators with missing covariates+Yang, Hu; Liu, Huilan+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAR 2016::Bayesian analysis of a Tobit quantile regression model+Yu, Keming; Stander, Julian+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR 2007::Bayesian quantile regression+Yu, KM; Moyeed, RA+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+OCT 15 2001::The adaptive lasso and its oracle properties+Zou, Hui+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 2006"
Fast DD-classification of functional data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0738-3,DEC 2017,48,3,"A fast nonparametric procedure for classifying functional data is introduced. It consists of a two-step transformation of the original data plus a classifier operating on a low-dimensional space. The functional data are first mapped into a finite-dimensional location-slope space and then transformed by a multivariate depth function into the DD-plot, which is a subset of the unit square. This transformation yields a new notion of depth for functional data. Three alternative depth functions are employed for this, as well as two rules for the final classification in . The resulting classifier has to be cross-validated over a small range of parameters only, which is restricted by a Vapnik-Chervonenkis bound. The entire methodology does not involve smoothing techniques, is completely nonparametric and allows to achieve Bayes optimality under standard distributional settings. It is robust, efficiently computable, and has been implemented in an R environment. Applicability of the new approach is demonstrated by simulations as well as by a benchmark study.","Functional depth,Supervised learning,Central regions,Location-slope depth,DD-plot,Alpha-procedure","GENE-EXPRESSION DATA,DATA DEPTH,DISCRIMINATION,NOTIONS,CURVES,SPACES","Mosler, Karl@Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany::Mozharovskyi, Pavlo@Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Mosler, Karl@University of Cologne::Mozharovskyi, Pavlo@University of Cologne",not exist,"Supervised functional classification: a theoretical remark and some comparisons+Baillo, A; Cuevas, A.+arXiv:0806.2831v1 [stat.

Semiparametric Bayesian inference on generalized linear measurement error models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0739-x,DEC 2017,32,0,"The classical assumption in generalized linear measurement error models (GLMEMs) is that measurement errors (MEs) for covariates are distributed as a fully parametric distribution such as the multivariate normal distribution. This paper uses a centered Dirichlet process mixture model to relax the fully parametric distributional assumption of MEs, and develops a semiparametric Bayesian approach to simultaneously obtain Bayesian estimations of parameters and covariates subject to MEs by combining the stick-breaking prior and the Gibbs sampler together with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Two Bayesian case-deletion diagnostics are proposed to identify influential observations in GLMEMs via the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Cook's distance. Computationally feasible formulae for evaluating Bayesian case-deletion diagnostics are presented. Several simulation studies and a real example are used to illustrate our proposed methodologies.","Cook's distance,Dirichlet process prior,Generalized linear models,Kullback-Leibler divergence,Measurement error models","STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS,MIXED MODELS,DISTRIBUTIONS","Tang, Nian-Sheng@Yunnan Univ, Dept Stat, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China::Li, De-Wang@Yunnan Univ, Dept Stat, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China::Tang, An-Min@Yunnan Univ, Dept Stat, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Tang, Nian-Sheng@Yunnan University::Li, De-Wang@Yunnan University::Tang, An-Min@Yunnan University",not exist,"A general maximum likelihood analysis of measurement error in generalized linear models+Aitkin, M; Rocci, R+STATISTICS AND COMPUTING+APR 2002::Laplace approximation in measurement error models+Battauz, Michela+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+MAY 2011::STRUCTURAL MODELING OF MEASUREMENT ERROR IN GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS WITH RASCH MEASURES AS COVARIATES+Battauz, Michela; Bellio, Ruggero+PSYCHOMETRIKA+JAN 2011::Instrumental variable estimation in generalized linear measurement error models+Buzas, JS; Stefanski, LA+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1996::A nonlinear regression model with skew-normal errors+Cancho, Vicente G.; Lachos, Victor H.; Ortega, Edwin M.

Efficiency comparisons for partially rank-ordered set sampling,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0742-2,DEC 2017,25,0,"Partially rank-ordered set sampling (PROSS) is a generalization of ranked-set sampling (RSS) in which the ranker is not required to give a full ranking in each set. In this paper, we study the efficiency of the PROSS sample mean under perfect rankings for various PROSS schemes. We obtain conditions under which one PROSS scheme is always more efficient than another, and we also obtain conditions under which how the efficiencies of two PROSS schemes compare depends on the particular distribution. We completely determine how PROSS schemes compare in the two-subset case, and we also prove a conjecture of Ozturk (Environ Ecol Stat 18:757-779, 2011) about how the efficiency of the PROSS sample mean compares to that of the RSS sample mean.","Majorization,Order statistics,Perfect rankings,Ranked-set sampling","STATISTICS,ESTIMATOR,INFERENCE","Frey, Jesse@Villanova Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Villanova, PA 19085 USA::Feeman, Timothy G.@Villanova Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Frey, Jesse@Villanova University::Feeman, Timothy G.@Villanova University",not exist,"Estimation of the shape and scale parameters of Pareto distribution using ranked set sampling+Abu-Dayyeh, Walid; Assrhani, Aissa; Ibrahim, Kamarulzaman+STATISTICAL PAPERS+FEB 2013::Modified inference about the mean of the exponential distribution using moving extreme ranked set sampling+Abu-Dayyeh, Walid; Al Sawi, Esam+STATISTICAL PAPERS+MAR 2009::Majorization: Here, there and everywhere+Arnold, Barry C.+STATISTICAL SCIENCE+AUG 2007::no title+David, H.

We first define the measures of reflection asymmetry using a weighting function and then extend this approach to construct measures of permutation asymmetry for bivariate data. We define the corresponding statistical tests based on these measures and find that the proposed tests have higher statistical power comparing to some other tests for permutation and reflection symmetry studied in the literature. In addition, the measures can be used to summarize dependence structure of a multivariate data set in a few numbers and to select a more appropriate copula in the model.","Measure of asymmetry,Reflection asymmetry,Permutation asymmetry,Copula,Empirical process","BIVARIATE COPULAS,TAIL DEPENDENCE,SYMMETRY,EXTREMES,MODELS","Krupskii, Pavel@Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Krupskii, Pavel@University of British Columbia",not exist,"Pair-copula constructions of multiple dependence+Aas, Kjersti; Czado, Claudia; Frigessi, Arnoldo; et al.+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+APR 2009::Test of symmetry based on copula function+Bouzebda, Salim; Cherfi, Mohamed+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+MAY 2012::Truncated regular vines in high dimensions with application to financial data+Brechmann, E.

Wild bootstrap tests for autocorrelation in vector autoregressive models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0744-0,DEC 2017,60,0,Tests for error autocorrelation (AC) are derived under the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors. The tests are not asymptotically valid if the errors are conditionally heteroskedastic. In this article we propose wild bootstrap (WB) Lagrange multiplier tests for error AC in vector autoregressive (VAR) models. We show that the WB tests are asymptotically valid under conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form. WB tests based on a version of the heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimator are found to have the smallest error in rejection probability under the null and high power under the alternative. We apply the tests to VAR models for credit default swap prices and Euribor interest rates. An important result that we find is that the WB tests lead to parsimonious models while the asymptotic tests suggest that a long lag length is required to get white noise residuals.,"Autocorrelation,Conditional heteroskedasticity,Heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimator,Lagrange multiplier test,Vector autoregressive model,Wild bootstrap","IMPULSE-RESPONSE FUNCTIONS,FINITE-SAMPLE PROPERTIES,CORRELATION GARCH MODEL,COINTEGRATION RANK,CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY,CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS,SERIAL-CORRELATION,REGRESSION-MODELS,GENERALIZED ARCH,LINEAR-MODELS","Ahlgren, Niklas@Hanken Sch Econ, POB 479,Arkadiagatan 22, Helsinki 00101, Finland::Catani, Paul@Hanken Sch Econ, POB 479,Arkadiagatan 22, Helsinki 00101, Finland","Ahlgren, Niklas@Unknow::Catani, Paul@Unknow",not exist,"Bootstrap and fast double bootstrap tests of cointegration rank with financial time series+Ahlgren, N.; Antell, J.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 15 2008::Tests of cointegration rank with strong persistence in volatility: an application to the pricing of risk in the long run+Ahlgren, N; Catani, P.+Contributions to mathematics, statistics, econometrics, and finance: essays in honour of Professor Seppo Pynnonen.

Regression discontinuity: review with extensions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0745-z,DEC 2017,79,2,"In treatment effect analysis, often the treatment takes a particular structure: 'on' if an underlying continuous variable crosses a threshold, and 'off' otherwise. Such a treatment occurs in various institutional settings such as a test score crossing a threshold to graduate, or income falling below a threshold to qualify for an aid. In this kind of cases, the study design is called 'regression discontinuity (RD)', which is popular in analyzing observational data, as long as the treatment takes the required form. This paper reviews RD to convey its essentials, and provides some extensions. First, the main RD idea based on local randomization due to an institutional/legal break is introduced. Second, treatment effects identified by RD are explored. Third, popular RD estimators are reviewed. Fourth, main specification tests are examined. Fifth, special RD topics are reviewed. Also, an empirical illustration is provided.","Regression discontinuity,Instrumental variable estimator,Nonparametrics","MEDICAL-CARE,UNEMPLOYMENT DURATION,STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT,COLLEGE ENROLLMENT,MARGINAL RETURNS,PROPENSITY SCORE,CLASS-SIZE,DESIGN,INFERENCE,ECONOMICS","Choi, Jin-young@Goethe Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Frankfurt, Germany::Lee, Myoung-jae@Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 02841, South Korea","Choi, Jin-young@Goethe University Frankfurt::Lee, Myoung-jae@Korea University",not exist,"Bootstrap tests for distributional treatment effects in instrumental variable models+Abadie, A+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 2002::The Role of Hospital Heterogeneity in Measuring Marginal Returns to Medical Care: A Reply to Barreca, Guldi, Lindo, and Waddell+Almond, Douglas; Doyle, Joseph J., Jr.; Kowalski, Amanda E.; et al.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+NOV 2011::ESTIMATING MARGINAL RETURNS TO MEDICAL CARE: EVIDENCE FROM AT-RISK NEWBORNS+Almond, Douglas; Doyle, Joseph J., Jr.; Kowalski, Amanda E.; et al.+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 2010::Using Maimonides' rule to estimate the effect of class size on scholastic achievement+Angrist, JD; Lavy, V+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+MAY 1999::Wanna Get Away?

A comparison of the minimum distance estimator and the EM-algorithm when fitting -component univariate normal mixtures,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-016-0747-x,DEC 2017,37,0,"The method of maximum likelihood using the EM-algorithm for fitting finite mixtures of normal distributions is the accepted method of estimation ever since it has been shown to be superior to the method of moments. Recent books testify to this. There has however been criticism of the method of maximum likelihood for this problem, the main criticism being when the variances of component distributions are unequal the likelihood is in fact unbounded and there can be multiple local maxima. Another major criticism is that the maximum likelihood estimator is not robust. Several alternative minimum distance estimators have since been proposed as a way of dealing with the first problem. This paper deals with one of these estimators which is not only superior due to its robustness, but in fact can have an advantage in numerical studies even at the model distribution. Importantly, robust alternatives of the EM-algorithm, ostensibly fitting t distributions when in fact the data are mixtures of normals, are also not competitive at the normal mixture model when compared to the chosen minimum distance estimator. It is argued for instance that natural processes should lead to mixtures whose component distributions are normal as a result of the Central Limit Theorem. On the other hand data can be contaminated because of extraneous sources as are typically assumed in robustness studies. This calls for a robust estimator.","EM algorithm,Minimum distance estimation,Robust estimation,Monte Carlo simulation","MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION,NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS,SWITCHING REGRESSIONS,MODELS,TESTS,CONVERGENCE,PROPORTION,PARAMETERS,DENSITIES","Clarke, Brenton R.@Murdoch Univ, Math & Stat, Sch Engn & IT, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia::Davidson, Thomas@Australian Bur Stat, Perth, WA 6000, Australia::Hammarstrand, Robert@Murdoch Univ, Math & Stat, Sch Engn & IT, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia","Clarke, Brenton R.@Murdoch University::Davidson, Thomas@Unknow::Hammarstrand, Robert@Murdoch University","Clarke, Brenton R@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1419-0768","no title+Amemiya,, T.+Advanced Econometrics+1985::Standard errors of fitted component means of normal mixtures+Basford, KE; Greenway, DR; McLachlan, GJ; et al.+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS+1997::mixtools: An R Package for Analyzing Finite Mixture Models+Benaglia, Tatiana; Chauveau, Didier; Hunter, David R.; et al.+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE+OCT 2009::Choosing starting values for the EM algorithm for getting the highest likelihood in multivariate Gaussian mixture models+Biernacki, C; Celeux, G; Govaert, G+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JAN 28 2003::Degeneracy in the maximum likelihood estimation of univariate Gaussian mixtures with EM+Biernacki, C; Chretien, S+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 15 2003::AN ESTIMATION PROCEDURE FOR MIXTURES OF DISTRIBUTIONS+CHOI, K; BULGREN, WG+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1968::ROBUST ESTIMATION OF K-COMPONENT UNIVARIATE NORMAL MIXTURES+CLARKE, BR; HEATHCOTE, CR+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+MAR 1994::ESTIMATING MIXTURES OF NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS AND SWITCHING REGRESSIONS - COMMENT+CLARKE, BR; HEATHCOTE, CR+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1978::A review of differentiability in relation to robustness with application to seismic data analysis+Clarke, BR.+Proc Indian Natl Sci Acad+2000::AN UNBIASED MINIMUM DISTANCE ESTIMATOR OF THE PROPORTION PARAMETER IN A MIXTURE OF 2 NORMAL-DISTRIBUTIONS+CLARKE, BR+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+FEB 1989::On the convergence of Newton's method when estimating higher dimensional parameters+Clarke, Brenton R.; Futschik, Andreas+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+MAY 2007::Minimum Hellinger distance estimation for finite mixture models+Cutler, A; CorderoBrana, OI+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+DEC 1996::MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FROM INCOMPLETE DATA VIA EM ALGORITHM+DEMPSTER, AP; LAIRD, NM; RUBIN, DB+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1977::Order selection in finite mixtures of linear regressions+Depraetere, Nicolas; Vandebroek, Martina+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2014::THE ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE METHOD FOR THE RELATION BETWEEN A PART AND THE WHOLE+FISHER, RA+BIOMETRICS+1947::COMPARISON OF SOME METHODS FOR ESTIMATING MIXED NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS+FRYER, JG; ROBERTSO.CA+BIOMETRIKA+1972::nleqslv: solve systems of non linear equations+Hasselman, B.+R package version 2.0+2013::no title+HUBER, P.

The autoregressive coefficient is either a constant in or may depend on n and tend, not too quickly, to 1 as n tends to infinity. Under the null hypothesis, the innovations are i.i.d. mean zero random variables, while under the alternative there is some unknown interval of time, whose length depends on n, during which their expectation is shifted by some common value . Since innovations are not observed, we build weighted scan statistics based on the least square residuals of the process.

Characterizations based on higher order and partial moments of inactivity time,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0714-y,SEP 2017,21,1,"Due to the important role in theory of reliability, forensic science, study of risk analysis, actuarial science, survival analysis, and many other areas of applied probability, the study of inactivity time and its higher order and partial moments has received considerable attention from many authors. In the present paper we give some further insight on the subject. We provide characterization of some continuous distributions based on higher order moments of inactivity time. It is shown that the distribution function can be obtained uniquely through the higher order moments of inactivity time.

Dynamic tail dependence clustering of financial time series,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0718-7,SEP 2017,20,4,"In this paper we propose a dynamic clustering procedure for time series returns, aimed at providing a criterion for portfolio selection during financial crisis periods focusing attention on the lower tails of the returns distributions. In particular, for each pair of returns a time-varying distribution function is estimated using a copula function; as a result, the coefficient measuring the lower tail dependence is also time-varying with dynamics based on past market volatility. In this way we model the possible contagion between stocks when volatility increases. Accordingly, the clustering procedure based on the lower tail dependence coefficients provides different aggregations ad each time t. The clustering solutions are used to build optimal minimum Conditional Value-at-Risk portfolios able to outperform classical strategies.","Time series clustering,Time-varying copula functions,Tail dependence,Conditional Value-at-Risk",CRITERIA,"De Luca, Giovanni@Univ Naples Parthenope, Via G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy::Zuccolotto, Paola@Univ Brescia, C da S Chiara 50, I-25122 Brescia, Italy","De Luca, Giovanni@Parthenope University Naples::Zuccolotto, Paola@University of Brescia","ZUCCOLOTTO, Paola@C-2539-2011@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4399-7018","no title+Cherubini, U.; Luciano, E.; Vecchiato, W.+Copula Methods in Finance+2004::CLUSTER SEPARATION MEASURE+DAVIES, DL; BOULDIN, DW+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE+1979::Time series clustering on lower tail dependence+De Luca, G; Zuccolotto, P.+Mathematical and statistical methods for actuarial sciences and finance+2014::A tail dependence-based dissimilarity measure for financial time series clustering+De Luca, Giovanni; Zuccolotto, Paola+ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION+DEC 2011::An examination of indexes for determining the number of clusters in binary data sets+Dimitriadou, E; Dolnicar, S; Weingessel, A+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 2002::Comparison of several cluster algorithms on artificial binary data scenarios from tourism marketing+Dolnicar, S; Leisch, F; Weingessel, A<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Buchta, C; Dimitriadou, EA</span>.+SFB adaptive information systems and modeling in economics and management science+1998::Clustering of time series via non-parametric tail dependence estimation+Durante, Fabrizio; Pappada, Roberta; Torelli, Nicola+STATISTICAL PAPERS+AUG 2015::ON SOME INVARIANT CRITERIA FOR GROUPING DATA+FRIEDMAN, HP; RUBIN, J+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1967::Multivariate analysis in vector time series+Galeano, P.; Pena, D.+Resenhas+2000::A K-means clustering algorithm+Hartigan, J.A.; Wong, M.A.+Applied Statistics+1979::no title+Joe, H.+Multivariate Models and Dependence Concepts+1997::Portfolio optimization with conditional value-at risk objective and constraints+Krokhmal, P.; Palmquist, J.; Uryasev, S.+Journal of Risk+2002::Clustering heteroskedastic time series by model-based procedures+Otranto, Edoardo+COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS &amp; DATA ANALYSIS+JUN 15 2008::Comparing Several Parametric and Nonparametric Approaches to Time Series Clustering: A Simulation Study+Pertega Diaz, Sonia; Vilar, Jose A.+JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION+NOV 2010::Non-Graphical Solutions for Cattell's Scree Test+Raiche, Gilles; Walls, Theodore A.; Magis, David; et al.+METHODOLOGY-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RESEARCH METHODS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES+2013::OBJECTIVE CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF CLUSTERING METHODS+RAND, WM+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::A criterion for determining the number of groups in a classification+Ratkowsky, D.A.; Lance, G.N.+Australian Computer Journal+Aug. 1978::Optimization of conditional value-at-risk+Rockafellar, R; Uryasev, S.+J Risk+2000::CLUSTERING METHODS BASED ON LIKELIHOOD RATIO CRITERIA+SCOTT, AJ; SYMONS, MJ+BIOMETRICS+1971::A statistical method for evaluating systematic relationships+SOKAL, ROBERT R.; MICHENER, CHARLES D.+UNIV KANSAS SCI BULL+1958"

A Legendre multiwavelets approach to copula density estimation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0720-0,SEP 2017,27,0,"In this paper, a novel method for copula density estimation using Legendre multiwavelet is proposed. In general, copula density estimation methods based on the multiwavelet benefit from some useful properties, including they are symmetric, orthogonal and have compact support. In particular, the Legendre multiwavelet as a more general and vector-valued polynomial type of wavelets would results a more flexible and accurate approximation for the given copula density. In addition to high ability and nice properties of Legendre multiwavelet in approximation, its support is defined on unit interval, [0,1], as copulas that are normalized to have the support on the unit square and uniform marginal. We further make this approximation method more accurate by using multiresolution techniques. The comparative study reveals that the approximation proposed in this paper is more accurate than a scalar wavelet bases approximation. We eventually apply presented method to approximate multivariate distribution using pair-copula as a flexible multivariate copula to model a dataset of Norwegian financial data.","Copula,Orthogonal series,Wavelets,Legendre multiwavelet","DEPENDENT RANDOM-VARIABLES,WAVELETS,VINES,BASES","Chatrabgoun, O.@Malayer Univ, Fac Math Sci & Stat, Dept Stat, Malayer, Iran::Parham, G.@Shahid Chamran Univ Ahvaz, Fac Math Sci & Comp, Dept Stat, Ahwaz, Iran::Chinipardaz, R.@Shahid Chamran Univ Ahvaz, Fac Math Sci & Comp, Dept Stat, Ahwaz, Iran","Chatrabgoun, O.@Unknow::Parham, G.@Unknow::Chinipardaz, R.@Unknow",not exist,"Pair-copula constructions of multiple dependence+Aas, Kjersti; Czado, Claudia; Frigessi, Arnoldo; et al.+INSURANCE MATHEMATICS &amp; ECONOMICS+APR 2009::Adaptive solution of partial differential equations in multiwavelet bases+Alpert, B; Beylkin, G; Gines, D; et al.+JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS+OCT 10 2002::Thresholding methods to estimate copula density+Autin, F.; Le Pennec, E.; Tribouley, K.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+JAN 2010::Probability density decomposition for conditionally dependent random variables modeled by vines+Bedford, T; Cooke, RM+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE+2001::Vines - A new graphical model for dependent random variables+Bedford, T; Cooke, RM+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+AUG 2002::Approximate uncertainty modeling with vine copulas+Bedford, T; Daneshkhah, A; Wilson, K.+Risk Anal+2015::A note on minimum distance estimation of copula densities+Biau, G; Wegkamp, M+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+JUN 15 2005::no title+Christensen, O.+An Introduction to Frames and Riesz Bases+2003::no title+Chui, C.

The generalized preliminary test estimator when different sets of stochastic restrictions are available,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0723-x,SEP 2017,33,0,"Arumairajan and Wijekoon (Commun Stat-Theor Methods, in press, 2014) proposed a generalized preliminary test stochastic restricted estimator (GPTSRE) to represent the preliminary test estimators when stochastic restrictions are available in addition to sample model. The aim of this paper is to define the GPTSRE when two different sets of competing stochastic restrictions are available. Moreover the conditions for superiority of GPTSRE based on one stochastic restriction over the other are derived with respect to mean square error (MSE) matrix criterion. Furthermore the estimator GPTSRE is theoretically compared with almost unbiased ridge estimator and almost unbiased Liu estimator in the MSE matrix sense. Finally a Monte Carlo simulation study and numerical example are done to illustrate the theoretical findings.","Stochastic restrictions,Generalized preliminary test stochastic restricted estimator,Mean square error matrix",LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL,"Arumairajan, Sivarajah@Univ Peradeniya, Postgrad Inst Sci, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka@Univ Jaffna, Fac Sci, Dept Math & Stat, Jaffna, Sri Lanka::Wijekoon, Pushpakanthie@Univ Peradeniya, Fac Sci, Dept Stat & Comp Sci, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka","Arumairajan, Sivarajah@University of Peradeniya::Wijekoon, Pushpakanthie@University of Peradeniya","Wijekoon, Pushpakanthie@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4242-1017","Mean squared error matrix comparisons of some biased estimators in linear regression+Akdeniz, F; Erol, H+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+2003::ON THE ALMOST UNBIASED GENERALIZED LIU ESTIMATOR UNBIASED ESTIMATION OF THE BIAS AND MSE+AKDENIZ, F; KACIRANLAR, S+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1995::On the distribution of shrinkage parameters of Liu-type estimators+Alheety, M.

A regression model for overdispersed data without too many zeros,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0724-9,SEP 2017,30,1,"A regression model for overdispersed count data based on the complex biparametric Pearson (CBP) distribution is developed. It is compared with the generalized Poisson regression model, the negative binomial regression model and the zero inflated Poisson regression model, which are based on the generalized Poisson (CBP), negative binomial (NB) and zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) distributions, respectively. It is shown that the CBP distribution is more adequate than the GP, NB and ZIP distributions when the overdispersion is not related to a higher frequency of 0, but to other low values greater than 0, so it may be appropriate for overdispersed cases in which there are external reasons that raise the number of low values different from 0. Firstly, we study the shape and the parameters of the CBP distribution and we compare it with the Poisson, GP, NB and ZIP distributions by means of the probability of 0, the skewness and curtosis coefficients and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we present an application example where the aforementioned performance is shown by the number of public educational facilities by municipality in Andalusia (Spain). Secondly, we describe two regression models based on the CBP distribution and the estimation method for their parameters. Thirdly, we carry out a simulation study that reveals the performance of the regression models proposed. Finally, one application in the field of sport illustrates that these models can provide more accurate fits than those provided by other usual regression models for count data.","CBP distribution,Overdispersion,Regression models for count data","NEGATIVE BINOMIAL REGRESSION,COUNT DATA,POISSON REGRESSION,COMPLEX PARAMETERS,MIXTURE","Rodriguez-Avi, Jose@Univ Jaen, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Jaen, Spain::Jose Olmo-Jimenez, Maria@Univ Jaen, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Jaen, Spain","Rodriguez-Avi, Jose@Universidad de Jaen::Jose Olmo-Jimenez, Maria@Universidad de Jaen","Rodriguez-Avi, Jose@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1673-9876::, Olmo-Jimenez, M.J.@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3527-3239","Modelling count response variables in informetric studies: Comparison among count, linear, and lognormal regression models+Ajiferuke, Isola; Famoye, Felix+JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS+JUL 2015::Statistical Modeling for Mortality Data Using Local Generalized Poisson Regression Model+Astuti, Erni Tri; Budiantara, I.

On the Simes test under dependence,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0725-8,SEP 2017,21,0,"In 1986, R. J. Simes proposed a modified Bonferroni test procedure for testing an overall null hypothesis in multiple testing problems, nowadays referred to as the Simes test. The paper of Simes may be considered as a basic step in the development of many new test procedures and new error rate criteria as for example control of the false discovery rate. A key issue is the validity of the Simes test and the underlying Simes inequality under dependence. Although it has been proved that the Simes inequality is valid under suitable assumptions on dependence structures, important cases are not covered yet. In this note we investigate p-values based on exchangeable test statistics in order to explore reasons for the validity or failure of the Simes inequality. We provide sufficient conditions for the asymptotic validity of the Simes inequality and its possible strictness. We also show by means of an easy-to-compute counterexample that exchangeability by itself is not sufficient for the validity of the Simes inequality.","Exchangeable random variables,Multivariate total positivity of order 2,Positive regression dependence,Simes inequality","FALSE DISCOVERY RATE,BONFERRONI PROCEDURE,TEST STATISTICS,MULTIPLE TESTS,INEQUALITIES,DISTRIBUTIONS,VARIABLES","Finner, H.@Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Leibniz Inst Diabet Res, Inst Biometr & Epidemiol, Dusseldorf, Germany::Roters, M.@Univ Trier, Fachbereich Math 6, Trier, Germany::Strassburger, K.@Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Leibniz Inst Diabet Res, Inst Biometr & Epidemiol, Dusseldorf, Germany","Finner, H.@Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf::Roters, M.@Universitat Trier::Strassburger, K.@Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf",not exist,"no title+Barlow, R.

Regression modeling of one-inflated positive count data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0726-7,SEP 2017,23,0,"This paper extends regression modeling of positive count data to deal with excessive proportion of one counts. In particular, we propose one-inflated positive (OIP) regression models and present some of their properties. Also, the stochastic hierarchical representation of one-inflated positive poisson and negative binomial regression models are achieved. It is illustrated that the standard OIP model may be inadequate in the presence of one inflation and the lack of independence. Thus, to take into account the inherent correlation of responses, a class of two-level OIP regression models with subjects heterogeneity effects is introduced. A simulation study is conducted to highlight theoretical aspects. Results show that when one-inflation or over-dispersion in the data generating process is ignored, parameter estimates are inefficient and statistically reliable findings are missed.

D-optimal designs for full and reduced Fourier regression models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0727-6,SEP 2017,18,0,"The optimal designs for Fourier regression models under the D-optimality criterion are discussed in this article. First, we investigate the D-optimal designs for estimating two coefficients corresponding to either sine or cosine terms in a full Fourier regression model. In many biological applications, estimating such specific pairs of coefficients is of interest. As a result of this article, the D-optimal designs for estimating these ""coefficient pairs"" can be constructed either explicitly or numerically for Fourier regression models with any order. Our resulting designs are provided for Fourier regression models with order less than 6. Secondly, we discuss the sensitivity of our resulting optimal designs for a full Fourier regression model when the true model is actually a reduced version of the assumed one. Lastly, we provide the algorithm for obtaining the D-optimal designs for a reduced Fourier regression model and the D-optimal designs for a useful reduced Fourier model are constructed. The comparison study shows that the constructed designs incorporating the reduced model are efficient.","Fourier regression,Least squares estimation,Regression design,Sawtooth wave,Symmetric design","COEFFICIENTS,DESCRIPTORS,SHAPE","Xu, Xiaojian@Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON, Canada::Shang, Xiaoli@Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON, Canada","Xu, Xiaojian@Brock University::Shang, Xiaoli@Brock University",not exist,"no title+Bracewell, R.

Asymptotic inference for maximum likelihood estimators under the special exponential family with double-truncation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0730-y,SEP 2017,33,0,"Biased sampling affects the inference for population parameters of interest if the sampling mechanism is not appropriately handled. This paper considers doubly-truncated data arising in lifetime data analysis in which samples are subject to both left- and right-truncations. To correct for the sampling bias with doubly-truncated data, maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has been proposed under a parametric family called the special exponential family (Efron and Petrosian, in J Am Stat Assoc 94:824-834, 1999). However, there is still a lack of justifying the fundamental properties for the MLE, including consistency and asymptotic normality. In this paper, we point out that the classical asymptotic theory for the independent and identically distributed data is not suitable for studying the MLE under double-truncation due to the non-identical truncation intervals. Alternatively, we formalize the asymptotic results under independent but not identically distributed data that suitably takes into account for the between-sample heterogeneity of truncation intervals. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the MLE under a reasonably simple set of regularity conditions. Then, we give asymptotically valid techniques to estimate standard errors and to construct confidence intervals. Simulations are conducted to verify the suggested techniques, and childhood cancer data are used for illustration.","Asymptotic normality,Central limit theorem,Consistency,Maximum likelihood estimation,Survival analysis,Truncated data","SURVIVAL,MODELS","Emura, Takeshi@Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Stat, Taoyuan, Taiwan::Hu, Ya-Hsuan@Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Stat, Taoyuan, Taiwan::Konno, Yoshihiko@Japan Womens Univ, Dept Math & Phys Sci, Tokyo, Japan","Emura, Takeshi@National Central University::Hu, Ya-Hsuan@National Central University::Konno, Yoshihiko@Japan Womens University",not exist,"Multi-state models for event history analysis+Andersen, PK; Keiding, N+STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH+APR 2002::Computationally simple estimation and improved efficiency for special cases of double truncation+Austin, Matthew D.; Simon, David K.; Betensky, Rebecca A.+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+JUL 2014::ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF ML ESTIMATORS WHEN SAMPLING FROM ASSOCIATED POPULATIONS+BRADLEY, RA; GART, JJ+BIOMETRIKA+1962::no title+CASTILLO J+ANN I STAT MATH+1994::no title+Cohen, A.

The minimum S-divergence estimator under continuous models: the Basu-Lindsay approach,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0701-3,JUN 2017,46,3,"Robust inference based on the minimization of statistical divergences has proved to be a useful alternative to the classical maximum likelihood based techniques. Recently Ghosh et al. (A Generalized Divergence for Statistical Inference, 2013a) proposed a general class of divergence measures for robust statistical inference, named the S-divergence family. Ghosh (Sankhya A, doi:, 2014) discussed its asymptotic properties for the discrete model of densities. In the present paper, we develop the asymptotic properties of the minimum S-divergence estimators under continuous models. Here we use the Basu-Lindsay approach (Ann Inst Stat Math 46:683-705, 1994) of smoothing the model densities that, unlike previous approaches, avoids much of the complications of the kernel bandwidth selection. Illustrations are presented to support the performance of the resulting estimators both in terms of efficiency and robustness through extensive simulation studies and real data examples.","Minimum S-divergence estimator,Robustness,Continuous model,Basu-Lindsay approach","DENSITY POWER DIVERGENCE,HELLINGER DISTANCE ESTIMATION,REGRESSION-MODELS,ROBUSTNESS,EFFICIENCY,CRITERION,TESTS","Ghosh, Abhik@Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata, India::Basu, Ayanendranath@Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata, India","Ghosh, Abhik@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute::Basu, Ayanendranath@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute","Ghosh, Abhik@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3688-4584","Cross- validation, the bootstrap, and related methods for tuning parameter selection+Altman, T; Leger, C.+Technical Report+1994::MINIMUM DISPARITY ESTIMATION FOR CONTINUOUS MODELS - EFFICIENCY, DISTRIBUTIONS AND ROBUSTNESS+BASU, A; LINDSAY, BG+ANNALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF STATISTICAL MATHEMATICS+DEC 1994::Robust and efficient estimation by minimising a density power divergence+Basu, A; Harris, IR; Hjort, NL; et al.+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1998::no title+Basu, A.; Shioya, H.; Park, C.+Statistical Inference: The Minimum Distance Approach+2011::MINIMUM HELLINGER DISTANCE ESTIMATES FOR PARAMETRIC MODELS+BERAN, R+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1977::Some recent developments in robust statistics+Bickel, PJ.+4 AUSTR STAT C+1978::no title+Bregman, L.+USSR Comput.

The Spearman rank correlation and Kendall's tau of an anti-symmetric family of copulas are necessarily odd functions of the parameter. Extending the parameter range of the FGM copula to the whole real line and truncated it from above and below using the Hoeffding-Fr,chet bounds generates a comprehensive anti-symmetric extension of the FGM copula. The detailed analytical representation of the extended FGM copula, the absolutely continuous and singular components, as well as the Spearman rank correlation and Kendall's tau dependence functions are derived.

Modeling time series of counts with a new class of INAR(1) model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0704-0,JUN 2017,32,3,"This paper presents a new model for a stationary non-negative first order of integer-valued random variables based on the Pegram and thinning operators. Some fundamental and regression properties of the proposed model are discussed. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) by the EM algorithm is applied to estimate the parameters. Numerical studies to compare the proposed model with the thinning and Pegram models and the breakdown point of MLE for the proposed model have been conducted. Finally, a real life count data set has been used to illustrate its application. Comparison with existing models by AIC showed that the proposed model is much better and illustrates its potential usefulness in empirical modeling.","Pegram operator,Thinning operator,Mixture,EM algorithm,Robustness,Additive and innovative outliers","MIXTURES,DISTRIBUTIONS","Khoo, Wooi Chen@Univ Malaya, Inst Math Sci, Fac Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia::Ong, Seng Huat@Univ Malaya, Inst Math Sci, Fac Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia::Biswas, Atanu@Indian Stat Inst, Appl Stat Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India","Khoo, Wooi Chen@Universiti Malaya::Ong, Seng Huat@Universiti Malaya::Biswas, Atanu@Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata@Indian Statistical Institute","ONG, Seng Huat@B-9454-2010@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4288-7637","First order integer valued autoregressive (INAR(l)) process+Al-Osh, M.

The test statistics are shown to have asymptotic normal or chi-squared distributions under the null hypothesis that the model errors belong to white noise series. By applying R, Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the test statistics. Simulation results indicate that the test statistics perform satisfactorily in both estimated sizes and powers.","White noise,Semi-parametric additive partial linear models,Empirical likelihood","TESTING SERIAL-CORRELATION,IN-VARIABLES MODELS,EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD,REGRESSION,ERRORS","Zhang, Tianyong@Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Chongqing, Peoples R China::Yuan, Demei@Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Chongqing, Peoples R China::Ma, Jiali@Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Chongqing, Peoples R China::Hu, Xuemei@Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Chongqing, Peoples R China@Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhang, Tianyong@Chongqing Technology & Business University::Yuan, Demei@Chongqing Technology & Business University::Ma, Jiali@Chongqing Technology & Business University::Hu, Xuemei@Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS@Chinese Academy of Sciences@Chongqing Technology & Business University",not exist,"TESTING FOR AUTOCORRELATION IN DYNAMIC LINEAR-MODELS+BREUSCH, TS+AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS+1978::no title+Brockwell, P.

On a mixed model analysis of multi-environment variety trials: a reconsideration of the one-stage and the two-stage models and analyses,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0706-y,JUN 2017,35,0,"Of interest is the analysis of results of a series of experiments conducted at several environments with the same set of plant varieties (called multi-environment variety trials). The most common practice is first to analyze individual trials and then to perform a kind of ""synthesis"" of the results obtained. This is considered as a two-stage approach to the analysis of the trial data. More recently a combined analysis of the raw plot data from all trials taken simultaneously has been advocated, as a one-stage approach to the analysis. The purpose of this article is to reconsider these two approaches with regard to the underlying models and the analyses based on them. The indicated differences between them are illustrated by a thorough analysis of a set of data from a series of trials with rye varieties. The required computations have been accomplished with the use of R.","Analysis of variance,Estimation,Hypothesis testing,Mixed effects model,Series of experiments,Stage-wise analysis","ORTHOGONAL BLOCK STRUCTURE,VARIANCE,GENOTYPE,DATABASE,DESIGNS","Calinski, T.@Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Math & Stat Methods, Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland::Czajka, S.@Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Math & Stat Methods, Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland::Kaczmarek, Z.@Polish Acad Sci, Inst Plant Genet, Strzeszynska 34, PL-60479 Poznan, Poland::Krajewski, P.@Polish Acad Sci, Inst Plant Genet, Strzeszynska 34, PL-60479 Poznan, Poland::Pilarczyk, W.@Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Math & Stat Methods, Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland::Siatkowski, I.@Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Math & Stat Methods, Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland::Siatkowski, M.@Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr Engn, Wojska Polskiego 50, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland","Calinski, T.@Poznan University of Life Sciences::Czajka, S.@Poznan University of Life Sciences::Kaczmarek, Z.@Polish Academy of Sciences::Krajewski, P.@Polish Academy of Sciences::Pilarczyk, W.@Poznan University of Life Sciences::Siatkowski, I.@Poznan University of Life Sciences::Siatkowski, M.@Poznan University of Life Sciences",not exist,"Analyzing multi-environment variety trials using randomization-derived mixed models+Calinski, T; Czajka, S; Kaczmarek, Z; et al.+BIOMETRICS+JUN 2005::A model for the analysis of a series of experiments repeated at several places over a period of years.

Some equalities and inequalities for covariance matrices of estimators under linear model,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0707-x,JUN 2017,21,6,"Best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) of unknown parameters under linear models have minimum covariance matrices in the Lowner partial ordering among all linear unbiased estimators of the unknown parameters. Hence, BLUEs' covariance matrices are usually used as a criterion to compare optimality with other types of estimator. During this work, people often need to establish certain equalities and inequalities for BLUEs' covariance matrices, and use them in statistical inference of regression models. This paper aims at establishing some analytical formulas for calculating ranks and inertias of BLUEs' covariance matrices under general linear model, and using these formulas in the comparison of covariance matrices of BLUEs with other types of estimator. This is in fact a mathematical work, and some new tools in matrix analysis are essentially utilized.","General linear model,BLUE,Covariance matrix,Rank,Inertia,Lowner partial ordering","BLUES,OLSE","Tian, Y.@Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China","Tian, Y.@Central University of Finance & Economics",not exist,"CHARACTERIZATIONS OF ESTIMABILITY IN THE GENERAL LINEAR-MODEL+ALALOUF, IS; STYAN, GPH+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1979::On relations between BLUEs under two transformed linear models+Dong, Baomin; Guo, Wenxing; Tian, Yongge+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+OCT 2014::no title+Drygas, H.+The coordinate-free approach to Gauss-Markov estimation+1970::GENERAL THEORY AND METHODS FOR MATRIC FACTORING+Guttman, Louis+PSYCHOMETRIKA+MAR 1944::The BLUE's covariance matrix revisited: A review+Isotalo, Jarkko; Puntanen, Simo; Styan, George P.

A conditional count model for repeated count data and its application to GEE approach,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-015-0708-9,JUN 2017,33,0,"In this article, a conditional model is proposed for modeling longitudinal count data. The joint density is disintegrated into the marginal and conditional densities according to the multiplication rule. It allows both positive and negative correlation among variables, which most multivariate count models do not possess. To show the efficiency of the proposed model for count data, we have applied to the generalized estimating equations and the inverse Fisher information matrix is compared with the covariance matrix from estimating equations. A simulation experiment is displayed and an application of the model to divorce data is presented. In addition, a comparison of conditional model and bivariate Poisson model proposed by Kocherlakota and Kocherlakota has shown using simulated data.","Count data,Generalized estimating equations,Conditional probability","COMPOUND POISSON-DISTRIBUTION,GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS,GAUSSIAN COPULA,REGRESSION","Dey, Rajib@Hajee Mohammad Danesh Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Stat, Dinajpur, Bangladesh::Islam, M.

The effects of different choices of order for autoregressive approximation on the Gaussian likelihood estimates for ARMA models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-002-0135-6,JAN 2003,30,3,"This paper investigates, by means of Monte Carlo simulation, the effects of different choices of order for autoregressive approximation on the fully efficient parameter estimates for autoregressive moving average models. Four order selection criteria, AIC, BIC, HQ and PKK, were compared and different model structures with varying sample sizes were used to contrast the performance of the criteria. Some asymptotic results which provide a useful guide for assessing the performance of these criteria are presented. The results of this comparison show that there are marked differences in the accuracy implied using these alternative criteria in small sample situations and that it is preferable to apply BIC criterion, which leads to greater precision of Gaussian likelihood estimates, in such cases. Implications of the findings of this study for the estimation of time series models are highlighted.","autoregressive approximation,autoregressive moving average model,Burg's algorithm,Gaussian likelihood estimates,order selection criteria,simulation","RECURSIVE ESTIMATION,TIME DOMAIN,PREDICTION,SERIES","Salau, MO@Nigerian Educ Res & Dev Council, Dept Stat, Garki, Abuja, Nigeria","Salau, MO@Unknow",not exist,"NEW LOOK AT STATISTICAL-MODEL IDENTIFICATION+AKAIKE, H+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL+1974::CALCULATION OF FILTER COEFFICIENTS FOR MAXIMUM ENTROPY SPECTRAL ANALYSIS+ANDERSEN, N+GEOPHYSICS+1974::CONSISTENT AUTOREGRESSIVE SPECTRAL ESTIMATES+BERK, KN+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1974::LINEAR PREDICTION BY AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL FITTING IN TIME DOMAIN+BHANSALI, RJ+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1978::no title+BOX G+TIME SERIES ANAL+1994::Maximum entropy spectral analysis+Burg, J.

Forecasting a class of doubly stochastic Poisson processes,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-002-0120-0,OCT 2002,5,5,"This paper deals with the doubly stochastic Poisson process (DSPP) with mean a truncated Gaussian distribution at any instant of time. The expression of its probability mass function is derived in this paper and it is also proved that the value of the process with maximum probability can be found in a known bounded interval. Furthermore, this paper also presents two methods to forecast the evolution of this kind of DSPP. The first one consists in modelling the mean process and then the probability mass function of the DSPP. The second method uses Multivariate Principal Component Regression to forecast the sample mean in the future instant and then the mass function. Both methods are applied to the real process of number of unpaid bank bills in Spain, forecasting the mass function of this process in 1997 and also its mode.","doubly stochastic Poisson process,truncated normal distribution,multivariate principal component regression models,bank bill",,"Bouzas, PR@Univ Granada, Fac Pharm, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-18071 Granada, Spain::Aguilera, AM@Univ Granada, Fac Pharm, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-18071 Granada, Spain::Valderrama, MJ@Univ Granada, Fac Pharm, Dept Stat & Operat Res, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Bouzas, PR@University of Granada::Aguilera, AM@University of Granada::Valderrama, MJ@University of Granada","Aguilera, Ana@H-5140-2015@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2425-6716","Forecasting time series by functional PCA.

These prediction intervals axe particularly useful if one has sampled the performance of several products and wishes to simultaneously predict the differences between future sample mean performance of these products and a standard with a predetermined joint probability.

Indirect estimation of (latent) linear models with ordinal regressors - A Monte Carlo study and some empirical illustrations,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-002-0111-1,JUL 2002,30,5,"This paper investigates the effects of ordinal regressors in linear regression models and in limited dependent variable models. Each ordered categorical variable is interpreted as a rough measurement of an underlying continuous variable as it is often done in microeconometrics for the dependent variable. It is shown that using ordinal indicators only leads to correct answers in a few special cases. In most situations, the usual estimators are biased. In order to estimate the parameters of the model consistently, the indirect estimation procedure suggested by Gourieroux et al. (1993) is applied. To demonstrate this method, first a simulation study is performed and then in a second step, two real data sets are used. In the latter case, continuous regressors are transformed into categorical variables to study the behavior of the estimation procedure. The method is extended to the case of limited dependent variable models. In general, the indirect estimators lead to adequate results.","micro econometrics,exogenous variables with ordinal scale,latent variables,indirect estimation","CONSISTENT ESTIMATION,VARIABLE MODELS,LEAST-SQUARES,PROBIT MODELS","Kukuk, M@Univ Tubingen, Wirtschaftswissensch Fak, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany","Kukuk, M@Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen",not exist,"no title+BERENSON ML+BASIC BUSINESS STAT+1992::no title+BRILLINGER DR+FESTSCHRIFT EL LEHMA+1982::no title+BROWNE MW+HDB STAT MODELLING S+1994::no title+Fang, K.; Kotz, S.; Ng, K.+Symmetric Multivariate and Related Distributions+1990::Which moments to match?+Gallant, AR; Tauchen, G+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+OCT 1996::Indirect inference+GOURIEROUX, C.; MONFORT, A.; RENAULT, E.+J.

Nonparametric monitoring of financial time series by jump-preserving control charts,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-002-0112-0,JUL 2002,32,4,"Since structural changes in a possibly transformed financial time series may contain important information for investors and analysts, we consider the following problem of sequential econometrics. For a given time series we aim at detecting the first change-point where a jump of size a occurs, i.e., the mean changes from, say, m(0) to m(0) + a and returns to m(0) after a possibly short period s. To address this problem, we study a Shewhart-type control chart based on a sequential version of the sigma filter, which extends kernel smoothers by employing stochastic weights depending on the process history to detect jumps in the data more accurately than classical approaches. We study both theoretical properties and performance issues. Concerning the statistical properties, it is important to know whether the normed delay time of the considered control chart is bounded, at least asymptotically. Extending known results for linear statistics employing deterministic weighting schemes, we establish an upper bound which holds if the memory of the chart tends to infinity. The performance of the proposed control charts is studied by simulations. We confine ourselves to some special models which try to mimic important features of real time series. Our empirical results provide some evidence that jump-preserving weights are preferable under certain circumstances.","digital image processing,EWMA control chart,financial econometrics,nonparametric smoothing,structural changes","CONTROL SCHEMES,ESTIMATORS","Steland, A@Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fak Math, D-44780 Bochum, Germany","Steland, A@Ruhr University Bochum",not exist,"Nonparametric methods in change-point problems+Brodsky, BE; Darkhovsky, BS.+Mathematics and its Applications+1993::no title+CHIU CK+J AM STAT ASSOC+1998::Nonparametric tests for nonstandard change-point problems+Ferger, D+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+OCT 1995::CHANGE-POINT ESTIMATORS IN CASE OF SMALL DISORDERS+FERGER, D+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 1994::On the Power of Nonparametric Changepoint-Tests+Ferger, D.+Metrika+1994::OUTLIERS IN TIME SERIES+FOX, AJ+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1972::Comparison of statistical methods in MR imaging+Godtliebsen, F.; Spjotvoll, E.+International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology+Spring 1991::NOISE-REDUCTION USING MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS+GODTLIEBSEN, F+JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE+MAR 1991::EDGE-PRESERVING AND PEAK-PRESERVING SMOOTHING+HALL, P; TITTERINGTON, DM+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1992::no title+Hardle, W.+Applied Nonparametric Regression+1990::no title+KRAMER HG+RISK MEASUREMENTS EC+1998::DIGITAL IMAGE SMOOTHING AND THE SIGMA FILTER+LEE, JS+COMPUTER VISION GRAPHICS AND IMAGE PROCESSING+1983::DETECTING CHANGE POINTS BY FOURIER-ANALYSIS+LOMBARD, F+TECHNOMETRICS+AUG 1988::EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CONTROL SCHEMES - PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS+LUCAS, JM; SACCUCCI, MS+TECHNOMETRICS+FEB 1990::CHANGE-POINTS IN NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION-ANALYSIS+MULLER, HG+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+JUN 1992::no title+MUTH JF+J AM STAT ASSOC+1960::Optimal change-point estimation in inverse problems+Neumann, MH+SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS+DEC 1997::no title+OGDEN RT+THESIS TEXAS AM U+1994::CONTINUOUS INSPECTION SCHEMES+PAGE, ES+BIOMETRIKA+1954::no title+PAWLAK M+VERTICALLY WEIGHTED+1999::no title+PETROV VV+SUMS INDEPENDENT RAM+1975::no title+RAFAJLOWICZ E+5696 POL WROCL+1996::Control Chart Tests Based on Geometric Moving Averages+Roberts, S.W.+Technometrics+1959::The Federal income tax consequences of terminations and mergers of partnerships+Schmalz, JG; Brumbaugh, MB; Pillow, RF+JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE TAXATION+FAL 1997::On EWMA charts for time series+Schmid, W.+Frontiers of Statistical Quality Control+1997::no title+SCHMID W+SEQUENTIAL CONTROL N+1999::CUSUM control schemes for Gaussian processes+Schmid, W+STATISTICAL PAPERS+JUN 1997::no title+Siegmund, D.+Sequential analysis+1985::no title+WAND MP+KERNEL SMOOTHING+1990::JUMP AND SHARP CUSP DETECTION BY WAVELETS+WANG, YZ+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1995::KERNEL-TYPE ESTIMATORS OF JUMP POINTS AND VALUES OF A REGRESSION FUNCTION+WU, JS; CHU, CK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+SEP 1993::A less sensitive linear detector for the change point based on kernel smoothing method+Wu, YH+METRIKA+1996"

Small sample properties of tests on homogeneity in one-way Anova and meta-analysis,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-002-0097-8,APR 2002,23,20,"In the present Monte Carlo study, the empirical Type I error properties and power of several statistics for testing the homogeneity hypothesis in a one-way classification are examined in the case of small sample sizes. We compared these tests under several scenarios: normal populations under heterogeneous variances, nonnormal populations under homogeneous variances, nonnormal populations under heterogeneous variances, balanced and unbalanced sample sizes, and increasing number of populations. Overall, none of the tests considered is uniformly dominating the others. Under normality and variance heterogeneity, the Brown-Forsythe and the Welch test perform well over a wide range of parameter configurations, the modified Brown-Forsythe test by Mehrotra keeps generally the level, but other tests may also perform well, depending on the constellation of the parameters under study. The Welch test becomes liberal when the sample sizes are small and the number of populations is large. We propose a modified version of Welch's test that keeps the nominal level in these cases. With the understanding that methods are unacceptable if they have Type I error rates that are too high, only the testing procedure associated with the modified Brown-Forsythe test can be recommended both for normal and nonnormal data. Under normality, the modified Welch test can also be recommended.","meta-analysis,balanced and unbalanced sample sizes,homogeneous and heterogeneous variances,nonnormality","NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS,RANK TRANSFORMATIONS,METAANALYSIS,BRIDGE,EQUALITY,BROWN","Hartung, J@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Argac, D@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Makambi, KH@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","Hartung, J@Dortmund University of Technology::Argac, D@Dortmund University of Technology::Makambi, KH@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"COPING WITH VARIANCE HETEROGENEITY+ASIRIBO, O; GURLAND, J+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1990::Some corrections of the significance level in meta-analysis+Bockenhoff, A; Hartung, J+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1998::SOME THEOREMS ON QUADRATIC FORMS APPLIED IN THE STUDY OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE PROBLEMS .1.

In the present paper, the Locally most powerful (LMP) tests are constructed for no contamination in normal mixture model through testing the parameter of mixture of distributions and the mixing proportion. The expected performance of LMP tests are compared using Efron's Statistical Curvature on the lines of Sen Gupta and Pal (1991). The Locally most powerful similar (LMPS) tests for the equality of control and treatment populations in the presence of nuisance parameters are also constructed.

Suppose a subset of the given k populations is selected using the subset selection procedure according to which the population pi(i) is selected iff Y-i greater than or equal to Y-(1) - d, where Y-(1) is the largest of the Y-i's and d is some suitable constant. The estimation of the location parameters associated with the selected populations is considered for the squared error loss. It is observed that the natural estimator dominates the unbiased estimator. It is also shown that the natural estimator itself is inadmissible and a class of improved estimators that dominate the natural estimator is obtained. The improved estimators are consistent and their risks are shown to be O(kn(-2)).

Expected utility within a generalized concept of probability - a comprehensive framework for decision making under ambiguity,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s00362-001-0083-6,JAN 2002,32,19,"It had often been complained that the standard framework of decision theory is insufficient. In most applications, neither the maximin paradigm (relying on complete ignorance on the states of nature) nor the classical Bayesian paradigm (assuming perfect probabilistic information on the states of nature) reflect the situation under consideration adequately. Typically one possesses some, but incomplete, knowledge on the stochastic behaviour of the states of nature.

In this paper first steps towards a comprehensive framework for decision making under such complex uncertainty will be provided. Common expected utility theory will be extended to interval probability, a generalized probabilistic setting which has the power to express incomplete stochastic knowledge and to take the extent of ambiguity (non-stochastic uncertainty) into account.

Since two-monotone and totally monotone capacities are special cases of general interval probability, where Choquet integral and interval-valued expectation correspond to one another, the results also show, as a welcome by-product, how to deal efficiently with Choquet Expected Utility and how to perform a neat decision analysis in the case of belief functions.","ambiguity,interval probability,decision making,expected utility,choquet expected utility,imprecise probabilities,capacities,lower and upper probabilities,non-additive measures,belief functions,choquet integral,multiple priors,linear programming,ambiguity aversion,ambiguity seeking",,"Augustin, T@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Augustin, T@University of Munich",not exist,"Optimale Tests bei Intervallwahrscheinlichkeit.

We consider this issue for Choquet Expected Utility maximizers in a simple framework, that is the problem of choosing on which event to bet. First, we find a necessary condition to prevent negative information value that we call Separative Monotonicity. This is a weaker condition than Savage Sure thing Principle and it appears that necessity and possibility measures satisfy it and that we can find conditioning rules such that the information value is always positive. In a second part, we question the way information value is usually measured and suggest that negative information values are merely resulting from an inadequate formula. Yet, we suggest to impose what appears as a weaker requirement, that is, the betting strategy should not be Statistically Dominated. We show for classical updating rules applied to belief functions that this requirement is violated. We consider a class of conditioning rules and exhibit a necessary and sufficient condition in order to satisfy the Statistical Dominance criterion in the case of belief functions.","information value,non additive measure,updating rule,statistical dominance",BELIEFS,"Vergnaud, JC@Univ Paris 01, CNRS, EUREQUA, F-75647 Paris 13, France","Vergnaud, JC@Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne@heSam Universite@Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","Vergnaud, Jean-Christophe@http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6604-4186","RISK, AMBIGUITY, AND THE SAVAGE AXIOMS+ELLSBERG, D+QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS+1961::DYNAMICALLY CONSISTENT BELIEFS MUST BE BAYESIAN+EPSTEIN, LG; LEBRETON, M+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY+OCT 1993::no title+FAGIN R+P 6 C UNC AI+1990::UPDATING AMBIGUOUS BELIEFS+GILBOA, I; SCHMEIDLER, D+JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY+FEB 1993::Decision making with belief functions: compatibility and incompatibility with the sure-thing principle+Jaffray, J.-Y.; Wakker, P.+Journal of Risk and Uncertainty+1994::BAYESIAN UPDATING AND BELIEF FUNCTIONS+JAFFRAY, JY+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS+SEP-OCT 1992::no title+MACCLENNEN E+RATIONALITY DYNAMIC+1990::Dynamic consistency and non-expected utility models of choice under uncertainty+Machina, M.+Journal of Economic Literature+1989::no title+Shafer, G.+A Mathematical Theory of Evidence+1976::no title+SMETS P+UNCERTAINTY ARTIFICI+1991::Nonexpected utility as aversion of information+Wakker, P.+Journal of Behavioral Decision Making+1988"

Out-of-sample forecast errors in misspecific perturbed long memory processes,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s003620100071,OCT 2001,15,1,In this papers we examine the relative increase in mean square forecast error from fitting a weakly stationary process to the series of interest when in fact the true model is a so-called perturbed long-memory process recently introduced by Granger and Marmol (1997). This model has the property of being unidentifiable from a white noise process on the basis of the correlogram and the usual rule-of-thumbs in the Box-Jenkins methodology. We prove that this kind of misspecification can lead to serious errors in terms of forecasting.

The performances of the estimators are compared based on the criteria of unbiasedness and mean square error in order to search for a 'best' estimator. Both analytical and graphical methods are explored. There is no superior estimator that uniformly dominates the others.

Moreover, we give three practical examples and a simulated example to illustrate the procedures. Further, simulation studies are given to show the advantages of the proposed method.

On constructing almost unbiased estimators of finite population mean using transformed auxiliary variable,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s003620100076,OCT 2001,17,0,"This paper is intended as an investigation of constructing almost unbiased estimators of finite population mean by suitably combining a set of transformed estimators. A generalization of Tracy, Singh and Singh (1999) estimator is suggested, and, to the first degree of approximation, each member of the proposed class is as efficient as the usual regression estimator. Further, it is proved that Reddy (1973) estimator is also a particular case of the proposed class. To the second degree of approximation, a new almost unbiased estimator is established. Moreover, an empirical study is carried out in order to understand better the performance of the new estimator compared to the usual unbiased (y) over bar, ratio (y) over bar (n) and Tracy et al.

Note on the bias in the estimation of the serial correlation coefficient of AR(1) processes,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s003620100077,OCT 2001,7,11,"We derive approximating formulas for the mean and the variance of an autocorrelation estimator which are of practical use over the entire range of the autocorrelation coefficient p. The least-squares estimator Sigma (n-1)(i=1) epsilon (i)epsilon (i+1) / Sigma (n-1)(i=1) epsilon (2)(i) is studied for a stationary AR(1) process with known mean. We use the second order Taylor expansion of a ratio, and employ the arithmetic-geometric series instead of replacing partial Ces xo sums. In case of the mean we derive Marriott and Pope's (1954) formula, with (n - 1)(-1) instead of (n)(-1), and an additional term oc (n - I)-'. This new formula produces the expected decline to zero negative bias as p approaches unity. In case of the variance Bartlett's (1946) formula results, with (n - 1)(-1) instead of (n)(-1). The theoretical expressions are corroborated with a simulation experiment. A comparison shows that our formula for the mean is more accurate than the higher-order approximation of White (1961), for \ rho \ > 0.88 and n greater than or equal to 20.

Precedence tests and Lehmann alternatives,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s003620100060,JUL 2001,6,14,"Precedence tests are considered in the context of four classes of one-sided Lehmann-type alternatives: G = F-k (k > 1); G = 1 - (1-F)(k) (k < 1); G = F-k (k < 1); and G = 1 - (1-F)(k) (k > 1), where F and G are two continuous cumulative distribution functions. If an optimal precedence test (one with the maximal power) is determined for one of these four classes, the optimal tests for the other classes of alternatives can be derived. Application of this is given using the results of Lin and Sukhatme (1992) who derived the best precedence test for testing the null hypothesis that the lifetimes of two types of items on test have the same distribution. The test has maximum power for fixed k in the class of alternatives G = 1 - (1-F)(k), with k < 1. Best precedence tests for the other three classes of Lehmann-type alternatives are derived using their results.

Mixed linear regression with equi-cross-correlated errors,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s003620100062,JUL 2001,10,0,"This paper investigates an one-step procedure for the General Least Squares Estimation with an estimated covariance matrix (GLSE) in the Linear Regression Model with stochastic linear restrictions on the regression coefficients. The covariance matrix of the errors is assumed to be known up to the correlations between the errors of the observations and the errors of the restrictions. It is assumed that all of these correlations are equal. After transforming the model into its canonical form we show, that the GLSE coincides with the Ordinary Least Squares Estimation (OLS) of the complete model, with OLS after deleting one appropriate observation or with the OLS after replacing two appropriate observations by their arithmetic average. Furthermore, we calculate the relative efficiencies of these estimators with respect to the BLUE using the generalized variance criterion. The resulting estimator may be better than the OLS-estimator, what depends essentially on the diagonal elements of the hat matrix. An example demonstrating this fact is given. Additionally, a new test is proposed for the independence of the disturbances.","Generalized Least Squares,parameter-dependent covariance structure,canonical correlation analysis,efficiency comparisons,tests of independence",LEAST-SQUARES,"Rodel, E@Humboldt Univ, Inst Informat, D-10099 Berlin, Germany","Rodel, E@Humboldt University of Berlin",not exist,"INEFFICIENCY OF LEAST-SQUARES+BLOOMFIELD, P; WATSON, GS+BIOMETRIKA+1975::no title+Harville, D.

The quincunx: history and mathematics,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s003620100048,APR 2001,19,4,The quincunx was invented by Sir Francis Galton in 1873 to demonstrate binomial distributions. During the last 125 years it has been used to illustrate the laws of the binomial and the normal distribution. In the first part of this paper we describe the historical background of Galtons invention and take a look at the discoveries he got from it. The second part of this paper discusses the mathematical background of the quincunx. We discuss the various limit theorems which explain the phenomena observable by this apparatus.(1).,,,"Kunert, J@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Montag, A@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany::Pohlmann, S@Univ Dortmund, Dept Stat, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany","Kunert, J@Dortmund University of Technology::Montag, A@Dortmund University of Technology::Pohlmann, S@Dortmund University of Technology",not exist,"no title+Darwin, C.+On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life+1859::no title+DAVID FN+INT ENCY STAT+1987::no title+Galton, F.+Hereditary genius+1869::no title+Galton, F.+Natural inheritance+1889::Statistics by intercomparison+Galton, F.+Philosophical Magazine+1875::Typical laws of heredity+Galton, F.+Proc.

Order statistics from non-identical right-truncated Lomax random variables with applications,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s003620100050,APR 2001,20,17,"In this paper, we derive some recurrence relations for the single and the product moments of order statistics from n independent and non-identically distributed Lomax and right-truncated Lomax random variables. These recurrence relations are simple in nature and could be used systematically in order to compute all the single and product moments of all order statistics in a simple recursive manner. The results for order statistics from the multiple-outlier model (with a slippage of p observations) are deduced as special cases. We then apply these results by examining the robustness of censored BLUE's to the presence of multiple outliers.","order statistics,outliers,robustness,single moments,product moments,recurrence relations,Lomax distribution,right-truncated Lomax distribution,permanents,censoring,bias,mean square error,BLUE",EXPONENTIAL RANDOM-VARIABLES,"Childs, A@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada@Al Azhar Univ, Dept Math, Cairo 11884, Egypt::Balakrishnan, N@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada@Al Azhar Univ, Dept Math, Cairo 11884, Egypt::Moshref, M@McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada@Al Azhar Univ, Dept Math, Cairo 11884, Egypt","Childs, A@McMaster University@Al Azhar University::Balakrishnan, N@McMaster University@Al Azhar University::Moshref, M@McMaster University@Al Azhar University",not exist,"ESTIMATING A MIXED-EXPONENTIAL RESPONSE LAW+ANSCOMBE, FJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1961::no title+Arnold, B.

Nonparametric methods in factorial designs,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s003620000039,JAN 2001,60,144,"In this paper, we summarize some recent developments in the analysis of nonparametric models where the classical models of ANOVA are generalized in such a way that not only the assumption of normality is relaxed but also the structure of the designs is introduced in a broader framework and also the concept of treatment effects is redefined. The continuity of the distribution functions is not assumed so that not only data from continuous distributions but also data with ties are included in this general setup. In designs with independent observations as well as in repeated measures designs, the hypotheses are formulated by means of the distribution functions. The main results are given in a unified form. Some applications to special designs are considered, where in simple designs, some well known statistics (such as the Kruskal-Wallis statistic and the chi (2)-statistic for dichotomous data) come out as special cases. The general framework presented here enables the nonparametric analysis of data with continuous distribution functions as well as arbitrary discrete data such as count data, ordered categorical and dichotomous data.","rank tests,factorial designs,repeated measures,unbalanced designs,ordered categorical data,count data","RANK STATISTICS,UNIFIED APPROACH,TESTS,MULTIVARIATE,MODELS,MAIN,EFFICIENCIES,HYPOTHESES,SAMPLES,TRIALS","Brunner, E@Univ Gottingen, Abt Med Stat, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany@Indiana Univ, Dept Math, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA::Puri, ML@Univ Gottingen, Abt Med Stat, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany@Indiana Univ, Dept Math, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Brunner, E@University of Gottingen@Indiana University System@Indiana University Bloomington::Puri, ML@University of Gottingen@Indiana University System@Indiana University Bloomington",not exist,"A unified approach to rank tests for mixed models+Akritas, MG; Brunner, E+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 16 1997::Nonparametric hypotheses and rank statistics for unbalanced factorial designs+Akritas, MG; Arnold, SF; Brunner, E+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+MAR 1997::FULLY NONPARAMETRIC HYPOTHESES FOR FACTORIAL-DESIGNS .1.

Estimating the locations and number of change points by the sample-splitting method,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/s003620000040,JAN 2001,24,8,"This paper derives a sequential testing and estimation method for the number of change points in structural-change models. In the first step, the parameters are estimated by a one-change model. The null hypothesis that there is no structural change against the alternative of one change is tested. If the null is rejected, then the whole sample is split into two subsamples by using the estimated change point in the previous step as a cutoff point. The same procedure is repeated until the null in each subsample is accepted. We argue that this method can consistently estimate the number, locations and magnitudes of changes. Situations in which the sample splitting method fails are also discussed.","multiple structural changes,change-point estimator,Brownian motion,Bessel process","PARAMETER INSTABILITY,STRUCTURAL-CHANGE,SHIFTS,VARIANCE,TESTS","Chong, TTL@Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Chong, TTL@Chinese University of Hong Kong",not exist,"TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY AND STRUCTURAL-CHANGE WITH UNKNOWN CHANGE-POINT+ANDREWS, DWK+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1993::PARTIAL PARAMETER CONSISTENCY IN A MISSPECIFIED STRUCTURAL-CHANGE MODEL+CHONG, TTL+ECONOMICS LETTERS+OCT 1995::no title+CHONG TTL+THESIS U ROCHESTER+1995::Nonparametric methods for changepoint problems+Csorgo, M.; Horvath, L.+Quality Control and Reliability+1988::no title+DARKHOVSKII BS+THEORY PROBABILITY I+1985::CROSSING PROBABILITIES FOR A SQUARE ROOT BOUNDARY BY A BESSEL PROCESS+DELONG, DM+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS PART A-THEORY AND METHODS+1981::ASYMPTOTIC DISTRIBUTION THEORY IN SEGMENTED REGRESSION PROBLEMS-IDENTIFIED CASE+FEDER, PI+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1975::MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION OF MULTIPLE CHANGE POINTS+FU, YX; CURNOW, RN+BIOMETRIKA+SEP 1990::LOCATING A CHANGED SEGMENT IN A SEQUENCE OF BERNOULLI VARIABLES+FU, YX; CURNOW, RN+BIOMETRIKA+JUN 1990::A MONTE-CARLO COMPARISON OF TIME-VARYING PARAMETER AND MULTIPROCESS MIXTURE-MODELS IN THE PRESENCE OF STRUCTURAL SHIFTS AND OUTLIERS+GAMBLE, JA; LESAGE, JP+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+AUG 1993::An analysis of the real interest rate under regime shifts+Garcia, R; Perron, P+REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS+FEB 1996::no title+HACCOU P+J STATIST COMPUT SIM+1988::TESTS FOR PARAMETER INSTABILITY IN REGRESSIONS WITH I(1) PROCESSES+HANSEN, BE+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1992::DETECTION OF MULTIPLE CHANGES OF VARIANCE USING POSTERIOR ODDS+INCLAN, C+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+JUL 1993::USE OF CUMULATIVE SUMS OF SQUARES FOR RETROSPECTIVE DETECTION OF CHANGES OF VARIANCE+INCLAN, C; TIAO, GC+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1994::19 review about estimation of change points+Krishnaiah, P.

The failure of meta-analytic asymptotics for the seemingly efficient estimator of the common risk difference,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02763004,OCT 2005,10,2,"We consider the,case of a multicenter trial in which the center specific sample sizes axe potentially small. Under homogeneity, the conventional procedure is to pool information using a weighted estimator where the weights used are inverse estimated center-specific variances. Whereas this procedure is efficient for conventional asymptotics (e. g. center-specific sample sizes become large, number of center fixed), it is commonly believed that the efficiency of this estimator holds true also for meta-analytic asymptotics (e. g. center-specific sample size bounded, potentially small, and number of centers large). In this. contribution we demonstrate that this estimator fails to be efficient. In fact, it shows a persistent. bias with increasing number of centers showing that it is not meta-consistent. In addition, we show that the Cochran and Mantel-Haenszel weighted estimators are meta-consistent and, in more generality, provide conditions on the weights such that the Associated weighted estimator is meta-consistent.","bias in conventional estimator,Cochran's estimator,heterogeneity in baseline risk,Mantel-Haenszel estimator,risk difference","CLINICAL-TRIAL,SPARSE","Kuhnert, R@Univ Med Berlin, Ctr Humanities & Hlth Sci, Inst Int Hlth Biometry & Epidemiol, Charite, D-14195 Berlin, Germany::Bohning, D@Univ Med Berlin, Ctr Humanities & Hlth Sci, Inst Int Hlth Biometry & Epidemiol, Charite, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Kuhnert, R@Free University of Berlin@Humboldt University of Berlin@Charite Medical University of Berlin::Bohning, D@Free University of Berlin@Humboldt University of Berlin@Charite Medical University of Berlin",not exist,"SOME METHODS FOR STRENGTHENING THE COMMON X2 TESTS+COCHRAN, WG+BIOMETRICS+1954::A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL COMPARING MELPHALAN PREDNISONE WITH OR WITHOUT INTERFERON ALFA-2B IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE-MYELOMA - A CANCER AND LEUKEMIA GROUP-B STUDY+COOPER, MR; DEAR, K; MCINTYRE, OR; et al.+JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY+JAN 1993::ESTIMATION OF A COMMON EFFECT PARAMETER FROM SPARSE FOLLOW-UP DATA+GREENLAND, S; ROBINS, JM+BIOMETRICS+1985::Number needed to treat: properties and problems+Hutton, JL+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY+2000::no title+KLEINBAUM DG+EPIDEMIOLOGIC RES+1982::AN ASSESSMENT OF CLINICALLY USEFUL MEASURES OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF TREATMENT+LAUPACIS, A; SACKETT, DL; ROBERTS, RS+NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE+JUN 30 1988::Tests for homogeneity of the risk difference when data are sparse+Lipsitz, SR; Dear, KBG; Laird, NM; et al.+BIOMETRICS+MAR 1998::STATISTICAL ASPECTS OF THE ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES OF DISEASE+MANTEL, N; HAENSZEL, W+JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE+1959::A COMPARISON OF 2 METHODS OF ESTIMATING A COMMON RISK DIFFERENCE IN A STRATIFIED ANALYSIS OF A MULTICENTER CLINICAL-TRIAL+OGORMAN, TW; WOOLSON, RF; JONES, MP+CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS+APR 1994::no title+PETITTI DM+METANALYSIS DECISION+1994"

Optimum group limits for estimation in scaled log-logistic distribution from a grouped data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02762839,JUL 2005,9,2,The well known logistic distribution is. considered. A transformation of the logistic variate in terms of exponential function results in a new distribution called log-logistic distribution suggested by Balakrishnan et al (1987). Estimation of its scale parameter from a grouped data is presented. Optimal group limits in the case of equispaced as well as unequispaced groupings so as to have a maximum asymptotic relative efficiency are worked out. The grouping correction in the case of equispaced grouped data with a mid point type estimator is also suggested.

Estimation of the intercept parameter for linear regression model with uncertain non-sample prior information,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02762840,JUL 2005,17,5,"This paper considers alternative estimators of the intercept parameter of the linear regression model with normal error when uncertain non-sample prior information about the value of the slope parameter is available. The maximum likelihood, restricted, preliminary test and shrinkage estimators are considered. Based on their quadratic biases and mean square errors the relative performances of the estimators are investigated. Both analytical and graphical comparisons are explored. None of the estimators is found to be uniformly dominating the others. However, if the non-sample prior information regarding the value of the slope is not too far from its true value, the shrinkage estimator of the intercept parameter dominates the rest of the estimators.","regression model,uncertain non-sample prior information,maximum likelihood, restricted, preliminary test and shrinkage estimators,bias, mean square error and relative efficiency",MULTIVARIATE NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION,"Khan, S@Univ So Queensland, Dept Math & Comp, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia@Carleton Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON, Canada::Hoque, Z@Univ So Queensland, Dept Math & Comp, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia@Carleton Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON, Canada::Saleh, AKME@Univ So Queensland, Dept Math & Comp, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia@Carleton Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Khan, S@University of Southern Queensland@Carleton University::Hoque, Z@University of Southern Queensland@Carleton University::Saleh, AKME@University of Southern Queensland@Carleton University",not exist,"Pooling multivariate data+Ahmed, S.

Divergence-based estimation and testing with misclassified data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02762841,JUL 2005,20,4,The well-known chi-squared goodness-of-fit test for a multinomial distribution is generally biased when the observations are subject to misclassification. In Pardo and Zografos (2000) the problem was considered using a double sampling scheme and phi-divergence test statistics. A new problem appears if the null hypothesis is not simple because it is necessary to give estimators for the unknown parameters. In this paper the minimum phi-divergence estimators are considered and some of their properties are established. The proposed phi-divergence test statistics are obtained by calculating phi-divergences between probability density functions and by replacing parameters by their minimum phi-divergence estimators in the derived expressions. Asymptotic distributions of the new test statistics are also obtained. The testing procedure is illustrated with an example.,"misclassification,double sampling,divergence estimators,goodness-of-fit tests,divergence statistics","DOUBLE SAMPLING SCHEME,OF-FIT TESTS,BINOMIAL DATA,GOODNESS","Landaburu, E@Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Stat & OR, Madrid 3, Spain@Miguel Hernandez Univ Elche, Ctr Operat Res, Elche, Spain::Morales, D@Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Stat & OR, Madrid 3, Spain@Miguel Hernandez Univ Elche, Ctr Operat Res, Elche, Spain::Pardo, L@Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Stat & OR, Madrid 3, Spain@Miguel Hernandez Univ Elche, Ctr Operat Res, Elche, Spain","Landaburu, E@Complutense University of Madrid@Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche::Morales, D@Complutense University of Madrid@Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche::Pardo, L@Complutense University of Madrid@Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche","Pardo, Leandro@http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2005-8245","A GENERAL CLASS OF COEFFICIENTS OF DIVERGENCE OF 1 DISTRIBUTION FROM ANOTHER+ALI, SM; SILVEY, SD+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY+1966::NEW PROOF OF PEARSON-FISHER THEOREM+BIRCH, MW+ANNALS OF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS+1964::Goodness of fit tests with misclassified data+Cheng, KF; Hsueh, HM; Chien, TH+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1998::MULTINOMIAL GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS+CRESSIE, N; READ, TRC+JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-METHODOLOGICAL+1984::Eine informationstheoretische Ungleichung und ihre An wendung auf den Beweis der Ergodizitat von Markoffschen Ketten+Csiszar, I.+Publ.

A method for consideration of conditional dependencies in the Fellegi and Sunter model of record linkage,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02762843,JUL 2005,10,4,"An objective of Record Linkage is to link two data files by identifying common elements. A popular model for doing the separation is the probabilistic one from Fellegi and Sunter. To estimate the parameters needed for the model usually a mixture model is constructed and the EM algorithm is applied. For simplification, the assumption of conditional independence is often made. This assumption says that if several attributes of elements in the data are compared, then the results of the comparisons regarding the several attributes are independent within the mixture classes. A mixture model constructed with this assumption has been often used. Within this article a straightforward extension of the model is introduced which allows for conditional dependencies but is heavily dependent on the choice of the starting value. Therefore also an estimation procedure for the EM algorithm starting value is proposed. The two models are compared empirically in a simulation study based on telephone book entries. Particularly the effect of different starting values and conditional dependencies on the matching results is investigated.","exact matching,probabilistic matching,mixture model,incomplete data,maximum-likelihood estimation,EM algorithm,simulation study",,"Schurle, J@Univ Tubingen, Dept Stat Economet & Operat Res, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany","Schurle, J@Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen",not exist,"no title+ARMSTRONG JB+P SECT SURV RES METH+1992::A THEORY FOR RECORD LINKAGE+FELLEGI, IP; SUNTER, AB+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1969::no title+KIRKENDALL NJ+RECORD LINKAGE TECHN+1985::Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm+Laird, N.M.; Dempster, A.P.; Rubin, D.B.+J.

Estimation in conditional first order autoregression with discrete support,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02762968,APR 2005,34,42,"We consider estimation in the class of first order conditional linear autoregressive models with discrete support that are routinely used to model time series of counts. Various groups of estimators proposed in the literature are discussed: moment-based estimators; regression-based estimators; and likelihood-based estimators. Some of these have been used previously and others not. In particular, we address the performance of new types of generalized method of moments estimators and propose an exact maximum likelihood procedure valid for a Poisson marginal model using backcasting. The small sample properties of all estimators are comprehensively analyzed using simulation. Three situations are considered using data generated with: a fixed autoregressive parameter and equidispersed Poisson innovations; negative binomial innovations; and, additionally, a random autoregressive coefficient. The first set of experiments indicates that bias correction methods, not hitherto used in this context to our knowledge, are sometimes needed and that likelihood-based estimators, as might be expected, perform well. The second two scenarios are representative of overdispersion. Methods designed specifically for the Poisson context now perform uniformly badly, but simple, bias-corrected, Yule-Walker and least squares estimators perform well in all cases.","bias correction,estimation,INAR models,overdispersion,small sample properties,time series of counts","TIME-SERIES,MODELS,IMMIGRATION,MARGINALS,COUNTS,BIAS","Jung, RC@Univ Tubingen, Wirtschafts Wissensch Fak, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany@Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia::Ronning, G@Univ Tubingen, Wirtschafts Wissensch Fak, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany@Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia::Tremayne, AR@Univ Tubingen, Wirtschafts Wissensch Fak, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany@Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Jung, RC@Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen@University of York - UK@University of Sydney::Ronning, G@Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen@University of York - UK@University of Sydney::Tremayne, AR@Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen@University of York - UK@University of Sydney",not exist,"First order integer valued autoregressive (INAR(l)) process+Al-Osh, M.

Deriving a lower bound for the proportion of perceivers in replicated difference tests by means of multiple test theory,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02762969,APR 2005,12,3,"Analyzing repeated difference tests aims in significance testing for differences as well as in estimating the mean discrimination ability of the consumers. In addition to the average success probability, the proportion of consumers that may detect the difference between two products and therefore account for any increase of this probability is of interest. While some authors address the first two goals, for the latter one only an estimator directly linked to the average probability seems to be used. However, this may lead to unreasonable results. Therefore we propose a new approach based on multiple test theory. We define a suitable set of hypotheses that is closed under intersection. From this, we derive a series of hypotheses that may be sequentially tested while the overall significance level will not be violated. By means of this procedure we may determine a minimal number of assessors that must have perceived the difference between the products at least once in a while. From this, we can find a conservative lower bound for the proportion of perceivers within the consumers. In several examples, we give some insight into the properties of this new method and show that the knowledge about this lower bound might indeed be valuable for the investigator. Finally, an adaption of this approach for similarity tests will be proposed.","replicated difference tests,perceivers,estimation,multiple tests","PREFERENCE TESTS,POWER","Meyners, M@Unknow","Meyners, M@Unknow",not exist,"The power of sensory discrimination methods used in replicated difference and preference tests+Bi, J; Ennis, DM+JOURNAL OF SENSORY STUDIES+SEP 1999::Beta-binomial tables for replicated difference and preference tests+Bi, J; Ennis, DM+JOURNAL OF SENSORY STUDIES+SEP 1999::The statistical power of replications in difference tests+Brockhoff, PB+FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE+JUL-SEP 2003::Handling replications in discrimination tests+Brockhoff, PB; Schlich, P+FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE+SEP 1998::The beta-binomial model: Accounting for inter-trial variation in replicated difference and preference tests+Ennis, DM+JOURNAL OF SENSORY STUDIES+DEC 1998::no title+HUNTER EA+ANAL DISCRIMINATION+2000::On the triangle test with replications+Kunert, J; Meyners, M+FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE+NOV 1999::CLOSED TESTING PROCEDURES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ORDERED ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE+MARCUS, R; PERITZ, E; GABRIEL, KR+BIOMETRIKA+1976::no title+MEYNERS M+ACT 7 JOURN EUR AGR+2002::The design of replicated difference tests+Meyners, M; Brockhoff, PB+JOURNAL OF SENSORY STUDIES+AUG 2003::no title+PRISO HE+J SENS STUD+1994::Risk tables for discrimination tests.+Schlich, P.+Food Quality and Preference+1993"
Bayesian decision criteria in the presence of noises under quadratic and absolute value loss functions,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02762970,APR 2005,17,3,"Misclassifications, or noises, in the sampling stage of a Bayesian scheme can seriously affect the values of decision criteria such as the Bayes Risk and the Expected Value of Sample Information. This problem does not seem to be much addressed in the existing literature. In this article, using an approach based on hypergeometric functions and numerical computation, we study the effects of these noises under the two most important loss functions: the quadratic and the absolute value. A numerical example illustrates these effects in a representative case, using both loss functions, and provides additional insights into the general problem.","noises,decision,beta distribution,square error loss,Bayes risk,expected value of sample information,hypergeometric functions,Picard's theorem","INFORMATION,ERRORS","Pham-Gia, T@Univ Moncton, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada::Turkkan, N@Univ Moncton, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada","Pham-Gia, T@University of Moncton::Turkkan, N@University of Moncton",not exist,"no title+Altman, DG.+Practical statistics for medical research+1999::no title+Exton, H.+Multiple hypergeometric functions and applications+1976::no title+French, S.; Rios-Insua, D.+Statistical Decision Theory+2000::THE IMPACT OF TESTING ERRORS ON VALUE OF INFORMATION - A QUALITY-CONTROL EXAMPLE+GABA, A; WINKLER, RL+JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY+JAN 1995::IMPLICATIONS OF ERRORS IN SURVEY DATA - A BAYESIAN MODEL+GABA, A; WINKLER, RL+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+JUL 1992::THE DETERMINANTS OF INFORMATION VALUE - SYNTHESIZING SOME GENERAL RESULTS+HILTON, RW+MANAGEMENT SCIENCE+1981::no title+JOHNSON NJ+COMMUN STAT-THEOR M+1982::The mean and median absolute deviations+Pham-Gia, T; Hung, TL+MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING+OCT 2001::INFORMATION LOSS IN A NOISY DICHOTOMOUS SAMPLING PROCESS+PHAMGIA, T; TURKKAN, N+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1992::SAMPLE-SIZE DETERMINATION IN BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS+PHAMGIA, T; TURKKAN, N+STATISTICIAN+1992::USING THE MEAN DEVIATION IN THE ELICITATION OF THE PRIOR DISTRIBUTION+PHAMGIA, T; TURKKAN, N; DUONG, QP+STATISTICS &amp; PROBABILITY LETTERS+APR 7 1992::no title+PHAMGIA T+UNPUB SCANDINAVIAN J+2002::AN APPROACH TO COMPENSATE FOR UNCERTAINTY IN KNOWLEDGE OF INSPECTOR ERROR+RAHALI, B; FOOTE, BL+JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY+1982::no title+RAHME E+APPL STAT+2000::no title+UNNIKRISHNAN NK+SANKHYA B+1999::Inference with imperfect sampling from a Bernoulli process+Winkler, R.

Fast initial response features for EWMA control charts,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02762034,JAN 2005,17,35,"The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control 49 chart became very popular during the last decade. It is characterized by simple handling and good performance. It turns out, however, that the most popular EWMA scheme with fixed-width control limits - the asymptotic control limits are taken and do not change over time - detects early changes rather slowly. For the competing CUSUM chart the so-called fast initial response (head-start) feature is developed which permits rapid response to an initial out-of-control situation. Meanwhile, in some papers similar modifications for EWMA schemes are described. We compare these approaches by using precise computation techniques, which are based on numeric quadrature rules and allow higher accuracy than earlier studies. Moreover, previous comparisons are restricted to the evaluation of the detection speed by comparing the average run lengths (ARLs), that is, the parameter of interest is constant during the whole monitoring period. Here, we consider more possible change point locations, which gives the EWMA control chart user a better insight into the scheme performance for early changes.",,"WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE,CONTROL SCHEMES,CONTROL LIMITS,RUN-LENGTH,CUSUM","Knoth, S@Europa Univ Viadrina, D-15207 Frankfurt, Germany","Knoth, S@European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder","Knoth, Sven@D-1209-2012@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9666-5554","MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF EWMA CONTROL SCHEMES WITH VARIANCE-ADJUSTED CONTROL LIMITS+CHANDRASEKARAN, S; ENGLISH, JR; DISNEY, RL+IIE TRANSACTIONS+JUN 1995::A SIMPLE METHOD FOR STUDYING RUN-LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS OF EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE CHARTS+CROWDER, SV+TECHNOMETRICS+NOV 1987::Evaluations of likelihood ratio methods for surveillance.

Optimal design in average for inference in generalized linear models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02762036,JAN 2005,14,2,"This paper considers the problem of optimal design for inference in Generalized Linear Models, when prior information about the parameters is available. The general theory of optimum design usually requires knowledge of the parameter values. These are usually unknown and optimal design can, therefore, not be used in practice. However, one way to circumvent this problem is through so-called ""optimal design in average"", or shortly, ""ave optimal"". The ave optimal design is chosen to minimize the expected value of some criterion function over a prior distribution. We focus our interest on the ave D-A-optimality, including ave D- and ave c-optimality and show the appropriate equivalence theorems for these optimality criterions, which give necessary conditions for an optimal design. Ave optimal designs are of interest when e.g. a factorial experiment with a binary or a Poisson response in to be conducted. The results are applied to factorial experiments, including a control group experiment and a 2x2 experiment.","D-A -optimality,design of experiment,design weights,factorial experiments,Generalized Linear Model,optimal design in average",,"Pettersson, H@Umea Univ, Dept Stat, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Pettersson, H@Umea University",not exist,"Optimal allocation for linear combinations of linear predictors in generalized linear models+Arnoldsson, G+JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS+OCT 1996::no title+ARNOLDSSON G+STAT STUDIES U UMEA+1996::no title+Atkinson, A.

Improved estimation of the mean in one-parameter exponential families with known coefficient of variation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02762037,JAN 2005,10,6,"The value for which the mean square error of a biased estimator 14 aT for the mean mu is less than the variance of an unbiased estimator T is derived by minimizing MSE(aT). The resulting optimal value is 1/[1+c(n)upsilon(2)], where upsilon = sigma/mu, is the coefficient of variation. When T is the UMVUE (X) over bar, then c(n) = 1/n, and the optimal value becomes 1/(n + upsilon(2)) (Searls, 1964). Whenever prior information about the size of v is available the shrinkage procedure is useful. In fact for some members of the one-parameter exponential families it is known that the variance is at most a quadratic function of the mean.

The parameters of Bernoulli arms are independent and identically distributed random variables from a generalized beta distribution G3B(a, b, lambda) with a, b > 0 and 0 < lambda < 2.

Comparing the Fisher information in record data and random observations,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02760565,OCT 2004,10,17,"We compare the Fisher information (FI) contained in the first n record values and record times with the FI in n i. i. d. observations. General results are established for exponential family and Weibull type setups, and a summary table is provided listing several common distributions. We show that the FI in record data improves notably once the record times are included, often changing from being less to being equal or greater than the FI in a random sample of the same size. The behavior in the Weibull case is surprising. There it depends on n, whether the records or the i. i. d. observations have more FI. We propose new estimators based on record data. The results may be of interest in some life testing situations.","exponential family,extreme value distribution,Fisher information,life testing,normal distribution,parameter estimation,record times,record values,sufficient statistics,Weibull distribution","ESTIMATING POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS,BREAKING OBSERVATIONS","Hofmann, G@Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile","Hofmann, G@Universidad de Concepcion",not exist,"On the Fisher information in record values+Ahmadi, J; Arghami, NR+METRIKA+2001::no title+Arnold, B.

Generalized quasi-likelihood,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02760566,OCT 2004,14,3,"The quasi-score function, as defined by Wedderburn (1974) and McCullagh (1983) and so on, is a linear function of observations. The generalized quasi-score function introduced in this paper is a linear function of some unbiased basis functions, where the unbiased basis functions may be some linear functions of the observations or not, and can be easily constructed by the meaning of the parameters such as mean and median and so on. The generalized quasi-likelihood estimate obtained by such a generalized quasi-score function is consistent and has an asymptotically normal distribution. As a result, the optimum generalized quasi-score is obtained and a method to construct the optimum unbiased basis function is introduced. In order to construct the potential function, a conservative generalized estimating function is defined. By conservative, a potential function for the projected score has many properties of a log-likelihood function. Finally, some examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.","generalized quasi-likelihood,estimating function,basis function",,"Lin, L@Shandong Univ, Sch Math & Syst Sci, Jinan 250100, Shandong Prov, Peoples R China","Lin, L@Shandong University",not exist,"ON ASYMPTOTIC OPTIMALITY OF ESTIMATING FUNCTIONS+CHEN, K; HEYDE, CC+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+NOV 1 1995::ROBUST ESTIMATION THROUGH ESTIMATING EQUATIONS+GODAMBE, VP; THOMPSON, ME+BIOMETRIKA+1984::QUASI-LIKELIHOOD AND OPTIMAL ESTIMATION+GODAMBE, VP; HEYDE, CC+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+DEC 1987::AN EXTENSION OF QUASI-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION+GODAMBE, VP; THOMPSON, ME+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+JUN 1989::no title+HEYDE CC+QUASILIKELIHOOD ITS+1997::POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS AND CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATING FUNCTIONS+LI, B; MCCULLAGH, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+MAR 1994::Quality of Children's diets at and away from home: 1994-96.+Lin BingHwan; Guthrie, J.; Frazao, E.+FoodReview+1999::Conservative estimating function in the nonlinear regression model with aggregated data+Lin, L+ACTA MATHEMATICA SCIENTIA+JUL 2000::no title+LIN L+STAT PROBABILITY LET+2001::QUASI-LIKELIHOOD FUNCTIONS+MCCULLAGH, P+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1983::no title+MCCULLAGH P+GEN LINEAR MODELS+1989::no title+SMALL CG+HILBERT SPACE METHOD+1994::QUASI-LIKELIHOOD FUNCTIONS, GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS, AND GAUSS-NEWTON METHOD+WEDDERBURN, RWM+BIOMETRIKA+1974::no title+Wei, B.+Exponential Family Nonlinear Models+1998"
Tail index estimation in small samples - Simulation results for independent and ARCH-type financial return models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02760567,OCT 2004,26,6,"Estimation of the tail index of stationary, fat-tailed return distributions is non-trivial since the well-known Hill estimator is optimal only under iid draws from an exact Pareto model. We provide a small sample simulation study of recently suggested adaptive estimators under ARCH-type dependence. The Hill estimator's performance is found to be dominated by a ratio estimator. Dependence increases estimation error which can remain substantial even in larger data sets. As small sample bias is related to the magnitude of the tail index, recent standard applications may have overestimated (underestimated) the risk of assets with low (high) degrees of fat-tailedness.","fat-tails,tail index of stationary marginal distributions,Hill estimator,minimal AMSE","DEPENDENT DATA,BOOTSTRAP,PARAMETER,FRACTION,SERIES","Wagner, N@Tech Univ Munich, Dept Econ & Business, D-80290 Munich, Germany@Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA::Marsh, TA@Tech Univ Munich, Dept Econ & Business, D-80290 Munich, Germany@Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Wagner, N@Technical University of Munich@University of California Berkeley@University of California System::Marsh, TA@Technical University of Munich@University of California Berkeley@University of California System",not exist,"COMPARISON OF STABLE AND STUDENT DISTRIBUTIONS AS STATISTICAL MODELS FOR STOCK PRICES+BLATTBERG, RC; GONEDES, NJ+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS+1974::no title+Danielsson, J.; de Vries, C.+Beyond the sample: extreme quantile and probability estimation+1997::The method of moments ratio estimator for the tail shape parameter+Danielsson, J; Jansen, DW; deVries, CG+COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS+1996::Tail index and quantile estimation with very high frequency data+Danielsson, J; de Vries, C.G.+Journal of Empirical Finance+1997::Using a bootstrap method to choose the sample fraction in tail index estimation+Danielsson, J; de Haan, L; Peng, L; et al.+JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS+FEB 2001::Comparison of tail index estimators+de Haan, L; Peng, L+STATISTICA NEERLANDICA+MAR 1998::no title+DECOROGNA MM+DISTRIBUTION EXTREMA+1995::no title+DEWACHTER H+EC NOTES MONTE DEI P+1994::How to make a Hill plot+Drees, H.; de Haan, L.; Resnick, S.

Three estimators for the Poisson regression model with measurement errors,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02777577,JUL 2004,14,8,"We consider two consistent estimators for the parameters of the linear predictor in the Poisson regression model, where the covariate is measured with errors. The measurement errors are assumed to be normally distributed with known error variance sigma(u)(2). The SQS estimator, based on a conditional mean-variance model, takes the distribution of the latent covariate into account, and this is here assumed to be a normal distribution. The CS estimator, based on a corrected score function, does not use the distribution of the latent covariate. Nevertheless, for small sigma(u)(2), both estimators have identical asymptotic covariance matrices up to the order of sigma(u)(2). We also compare the consistent estimators to the naive estimator, which is based on replacing the latent covariate with its (erroneously) measured counterpart. The naive estimator is biased, but has a smaller covariance matrix than the consistent estimators (at least up to the order of sigma(u)(2)).","Poisson regression model,measurement errors,corrected score estimator,structural quasi score estimator,naive estimator",GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS,"Kukush, A@Kiev Natl Taras Shevchenko Univ, Dept Mech & Math, UA-01033 Kiev, Ukraine@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Schneeweis, H@Kiev Natl Taras Shevchenko Univ, Dept Mech & Math, UA-01033 Kiev, Ukraine@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80799 Munich, Germany::Wolf, R@Kiev Natl Taras Shevchenko Univ, Dept Mech & Math, UA-01033 Kiev, Ukraine@Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Kukush, A@Taras Shevchenko National University Kiev@University of Munich::Schneeweis, H@Taras Shevchenko National University Kiev@University of Munich::Wolf, R@Taras Shevchenko National University Kiev@University of Munich","Kukush, Alexander@I-1313-2018","no title+EDLEFSEN LE+GAUSS VERSION 3 2 6+1995::no title+FAHRMEIR L+MULTIVARIATE STAT MO+1994::no title+Heyde, C.

On intra-class correlation coefficient estimation,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02777578,JUL 2004,14,1,"Consider the problem of estimating the intra-class correlation coefficient of a symmetric normal distribution. In a recent article (Pal and Lim (1999)) it has been shown that the three popular estimators, namely-the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), the method of moments estimator (MME) and the unique minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE), are second order admissible under the squared error loss function. In this paper we study the performance of the above mentioned estimators in terms of Pitman Nearness Criterion (PNC) as well as Stochastic Domination Criterion (SDC). We then apply the aforementioned estimators to two real life data sets with moderate to large sample sizes, and bootstrap bias as well as mean squared errors are computed to compare the estimators. In terms of overall performance the MME seems most appealing among the three estimators considered here and this is the main contribution of our paper.","symmetric normal distribution,second order admissibility,Pitman Nearness Criterion,Stochastic Domination Criterion",,"Pal, N@Univ Louisiana, Dept Math, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA@William Patterson Univ, Dept Math, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA::Lim, WK@Univ Louisiana, Dept Math, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA@William Patterson Univ, Dept Math, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA","Pal, N@University of Louisiana Lafayette@University of Louisiana System@Unknow::Lim, WK@University of Louisiana Lafayette@University of Louisiana System@Unknow",not exist,"A REVIEW OF INFERENCE PROCEDURES FOR THE INTRACLASS CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT IN THE ONE-WAY RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL+DONNER, A+INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW+APR 1986::A NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR 2ND ORDER ADMISSIBILITY WITH APPLICATIONS TO BERKSON BIOASSAY PROBLEM+GHOSH, JK; SINHA, BK+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1981::no title+HAQ MS+STAT PAP+1984::UNIVERSAL DOMINATION AND STOCHASTIC DOMINATION - ESTIMATION SIMULTANEOUSLY UNDER A BROAD CLASS OF LOSS FUNCTIONS+HWANG, JT+ANNALS OF STATISTICS+1985::no title+Johnson, R.

Conditional estimation of average on the basis of weighting data,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02777580,JUL 2004,6,0,"Let F(x, y) be a distribution function of a two dimensional random variable(X, Y). We assume that a distribution function F. (x) of the random variable X is known. The variable X will be called an auxiliary variable. Our purpose is estimation of the expected value m = E(Y) on the basis of two-dimensional simple sample denoted by: U = [(X-1, Y-1)... (X-n, Y-n)] = [X Y]. Let X = [X-1...X-n] and Y = [Y-1... Y-n]. This sample is drawn from a distribution determined by the function F(x,y). Let X-(k) be the k-th (k = 1,..., n) order statistic determined on the basis of the sample X. The sample U is truncated by means of this order statistic into two sub-samples: U-k,U-1 = [(X-(1), Y-t1)... (X(k-1), Ytk-1)] and U-k,U-2 = [(X-(k), Y-tk)... (X-(n), Y-tn)].

Let (Y) over bar (U1,k) and (Y) over bar (u2,k) be the sample means from the sub-samples U-k,U-1 and U-k,U-2, respectively. The linear combination (Y) over bar (U)(k) of these means is the conditional estimator of the expected value m. The coefficients of this linear combination depend on the distribution function of auxiliary variable in the point x((k)). We can show that this statistic is conditionally as well as unconditionally unbiased estimator of the average m. The variance of this estimator is derived.

The variance of the statistic (Y) over bar (U)(k) is compared with the variance of the order sample mean. The generalization of the conditional estimation of the mean is considered, too.","conditional estimation,auxiliary variable,order statistic,truncated probability distribution,sample quantiles,relative efficiency,conditional moments",,"Wywial, J@Univ Econ, Dept Stat, PL-40226 Katowice, Poland","Wywial, J@University of Economics in Katowice",not exist,"no title+Fisz, M.+Probability theory and mathematical statistics+1963::no title+Johnson, N.L; Kotz, S; Balakrishnan, N.+Continuous Univariate Distributions+1994::no title+Kotz, S.; Balakrishnan, N.; Johnson, N.

Plug-in bandwidth choice for estimation of nonparametric part in partial linear regression models with strong mixing errors,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02777223,APR 2004,31,1,"Consider a regression model where the regression function is the sum of a linear and a nonparametric component. Assuming that the errors of the model follow a stationary strong mixing process with mean zero, the problem of bandwidth selection for a kernel estimator of the nonparametric component is addressed here.

An important type of such an error is heaping - respondents tend to round-off or round-up the data according to some rule of thumb. For two special cases of the Weibull model we study the behaviour of the 'naive estimators', which simply ignore the measurement error due to heaping, and derive closed expressions for the asymptotic bias. These results give a formal justification of empirical evidence and simulation-based findings reported in the literature. Additionally, situations where a remarkable bias has to be expected can be identified, and an exact bias correction can be performed.","heaping,response variable error,measurement error modelling,socio-economic panel,survey design,duration models",,"Augustin, T@Univ Bielefeld, Inst Populat Res & Social Policy Res, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany@Univ Munich, Seminar Appl Econ Res, D-80539 Munich, Germany::Wolff, J@Univ Bielefeld, Inst Populat Res & Social Policy Res, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany@Univ Munich, Seminar Appl Econ Res, D-80539 Munich, Germany","Augustin, T@University of Bielefeld@University of Munich::Wolff, J@University of Bielefeld@University of Munich",not exist,"no title+BIEMER PP+MEASUREMENT ERRORS S+1991::no title+Greene, W.+Econometric Analysis+2000::Modelling heaping effects in unemployment duration models - With an application to retrospective event data in the German Socio-Economic Panel+Kraus, F; Steiner, V+JAHRBUCHER FUR NATIONALOKONOMIE UND STATISTIK+SEP 1998::no title+Lancaster, T.+The Analysis of Transition Data+1990::Weibull regression for lifetimes measured with error+Skinner, CJ; Humphreys, K+LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS+MAR 1999::MODELING INACCURACIES IN JOB-SEARCH DURATION DATA+TORELLI, N; TRIVELLATO, U+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 1993::no title+Wolff, J.+Selected topics in unemployment duration in two economies in transition: East Germany and Hungary+1998"

Simple detection of outlying short time series,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02777227,APR 2004,9,1,"Sets of relatively short time series arise in many situations. One aspect of their analysis may be the detection of outlying series. We examine the performance of standard normal outlier tests applied to the means, or to simple functions of the means, of AR(1) series, not necessarily of equal lengths. Although unequal lengths of series implies that the means have unequal variances, that are only known approximately, it is shown that nominal significance levels hold good under most circumstances, Thus a standard outlier test can usefully be applied, avoiding the complication of estimating the time series' parameters. The test's power is affected by unequal lengths, being higher when the slippage occurs in one of the longer series.","AR(1) models,short time series,normal outlier tests",,"Karioti, V@Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Math, Athens 15780, Greece::Caroni, C@Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Math, Athens 15780, Greece","Karioti, V@National Technical University of Athens::Caroni, C@National Technical University of Athens",not exist,"no title+Barnett, V.; Lewis, T.+Outliers in Statistical Data+1994::no title+Barnett, V.; Lewis, T.+Outliers in Statistical Data+1984::no title+Brockwell, P.J.; Davis, R.A.+Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting+1996::ON TESTING FOR SERIAL-CORRELATION IN LARGE NUMBERS OF SMALL SAMPLES+COX, DR; SOLOMON, PJ+BIOMETRIKA+MAR 1988::no title+Diggle, PJ; Liang, K-Y; Zeger, S.+Analysis of Longitudinal Data+1994::no title+Hawkins, D.

In 1987, Rohmel and Streitberg presented a general method to construct global level a tests based on ordered p-values when there exists no prior knowledge regarding the joint distribution of the corresponding test statistics. In the case of independent test statistics, construction of global tests is available by means of recursive formulae presented by Bicher (1989), Kornatz (1994) and Firmer and Roters (1994). Multiple test procedures can be developed by applying the closed test principle using these global tests as building blocks. Liu (1996) proposed representing closed tests by means of ""critical matrices"" which contain the critical values of the global tests. Within the framework of these theoretical concepts, well-known global tests and multiple test procedures are classified and the relationships between the different tests are characterised.","closed test procedures,cut-off tests,global tests,multiple test procedures,ordered p-values","BONFERRONI PROCEDURE,INEQUALITY,STATISTICS,HYPOTHESES","Bernhard, G@Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Dept Biostat, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland@Univ Mainz, Inst Med Biometr Epidemiol & Informat, D-55101 Mainz, Germany::Klein, M@Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Dept Biostat, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland@Univ Mainz, Inst Med Biometr Epidemiol & Informat, D-55101 Mainz, Germany::Hommel, G@Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Dept Biostat, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland@Univ Mainz, Inst Med Biometr Epidemiol & Informat, D-55101 Mainz, Germany","Bernhard, G@Novartis@Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz::Klein, M@Novartis@Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz::Hommel, G@Novartis@Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz",not exist,"SEQUENTIAL-TESTS OF HYPOTHESES IN CONSECUTIVE TRIALS+BAUER, P+BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL+1989::no title+BICHER A+THESIS U MAINZ+1989::Buying with exact confidence+Dalal, S.

Measuring robustness for weighted distributions: Bayesian perspective,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02778267,JAN 2004,13,1,"There are many situations where the usual random sample from a population of interest is not available, due to the data having unequal probabilities of entering the sample. The method of weighted distributions models this ascertainment bias by adjusting the probabilities of actual occurrence of events to arrive at a specification of the probabilities of the events as observed and recorded. We consider two different classes of contaminated or mixture of weight functions, Gamma(a) = {w(x) : w(x) = (1 - epsilon)w(0)(x) + eq(x), q is an element of Q} and Gamma(g) = {w(x) : w(x) = w(0)(1-epsilon)(x)q(epsilon)(x),q is an element of Q} where w(0)(x) is the elicited weighted function, Q is a class of positive functions and 0 less than or equal to epsilon less than or equal to 1 is a small number. Also, we study the local variation of psi-divergence over classes Gamma(a) and Gamma(g). We devote on measuring robustness using divergence measures which is based on the Bayesian approach.

Bayesian methods for contingency tables using Gibbs sampling,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02778268,JAN 2004,11,4,"(C)ell counts in contingency tables can be smoothed using log-linear models. Recently, sampling-based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) have been introduced, making it possible to sample from posterior distributions. The novelty of the approach presented here is that all conditional distributions can be specified directly, so that straightforward Gibbs sampling is possible. Thus, the model is constructed in a way that makes burn-in and checking convergence a relatively minor issue. The emphasis of this paper is on smoothing cell counts in contingency tables, and not so much on estimation of regression parameters. Therefore, the prior distribution consists of two stages. We rely on a normal nonconjugate prior at the first stage, and a vague; prior for hyperparameters at the second stage. The smoothed counts tend to compromise between the observed data and a log-linear model. The methods are demonstrated with a sparse data table taken from a multi-center clinical trial.","categorical data,MCMC simulation",,"Green, PE@Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 151, South Korea::Park, T@Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Seoul 151, South Korea","Green, PE@Seoul National University::Park, T@Seoul National University",not exist,"no title+Agresti, A.+An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis+1996::no title+Agresti, A.+Categorical data analysis+1990::Bayesian tests and model diagnostics in conditionally independent hierarchical models+Albert, J; Chib, S+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+SEP 1997::no title+Bishop, Yvonne M.

A cautionary note on the analysis of randomized block designs with a few missing values,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02778269,JAN 2004,8,0,"The randomized block design is routinely employed in the social and biopharmaceutical sciences. With no missing values, analysis of variance (AOV) can be used to analyze such experiments. However, if some data are missing, the AOV formulae are no longer applicable, and iterative methods such as restricted maximum likelihood (REML) are recommended, assuming block effects are treated as random. Despite the well-known advantages of REML, methods like AOV based on complete cases (blocks) only (CC-AOV) continue to be used by researchers, particularly in situations where routinely only a few missing values are encountered. Reasons for this appear to include a natural proclivity for non-iterative, summary-statistic-based methods, and a presumption that CC-AOV is only trivially less efficient than REML with only a few missing values (say less than or equal to 10%). The purpose of this note is two-fold. First, to caution that CC-AOV can be considerably less powerful than REML even with only a few missing values. Second, to offer a summary-statistic-based, pairwise-available-case-estimation (PACE) alternative to CC-AOV. PACE, which is identical to AOV (and REML) with no missing values, outperforms CC-AOV in terms of statistical power. However, it is recommended in lieu of REML only if software to implement the latter is unavailable, or the use of a ""transparent"" formula-based approach is deemed necessary. An example using real data is provided for illustration.","analysis of variance,linear mixed model,restricted maximum likelihood,Satterthwaite approximation",,"Mehrotra, DV@Merck Res Labs, Blue Bell, PA 19422 USA","Mehrotra, DV@Merck & Company",not exist,"SOME THEOREMS ON QUADRATIC FORMS APPLIED IN THE STUDY OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE PROBLEMS .1.

The finite-sample performance of robust unit root tests,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02926005,OCT 2003,23,3,"This paper investigates the relative small sample performance of several robust unit root tests by means of a simulation study. It is confirmed that the traditional least-squares based Dickey-Fuller test has substantially lower power than several robust alternatives if the error distribution is fat-tailed while its power gain is small at the normal model. Particularly good results are achieved by a quasi-maximum likelihood test. However, all robust tests under consideration exhibit severe size distortions if the disturbances follow a skewed distribution. Moreover, under additive outliers, robust tests fail to produce stable sizes and good power properties. Consequently, the value of using robust unit root tests depends heavily of the type of nonnormality at hand.","simulation study,nonnormality,power comparison","CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY,M-ESTIMATORS,STATISTICS,REGRESSION,INFERENCE,ERRORS","Carstensen, K@Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, D-24118 Kiel, Germany","Carstensen, K@University of Kiel",not exist,"Quantiles for t-statistics based on M-estimators of unit roots+Abadir, KM; Lucas, A+ECONOMICS LETTERS+MAY 2000::Efficient tests for an autoregressive unit root+Elliott, G; Rothenberg, TJ; Stock, JH+ECONOMETRICA+JUL 1996::THE EFFECTS OF ADDITIVE OUTLIERS ON TESTS FOR UNIT ROOTS AND COINTEGRATION+FRANSES, PH; HALDRUP, N+JOURNAL OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMIC STATISTICS+OCT 1994::On the distributions of Augmented Dickey-Fuller statistics in processes with moving average components+Galbraith, JW; Zinde-Walsh, V+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+NOV 1999::no title+Hampel, FR; Ronchetti, EM; Rousseeuw, PJ<span class=""fcr-data-normal"">; et al</span><span class=""fcr-data-additional"" style=""display: none;"">; Stahel, WA</span>.+Robust Statistics+1986::Asymptotic theory of LAD estimation in a unit root process with finite variance errors+Herce, MA+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+MAR 1996::CLASSICAL AND BAYESIAN ASPECTS OF ROBUST UNIT-ROOT INFERENCE+HOEK, H; LUCAS, A; VANDIJK, HK+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+SEP 1995::no title+Huber, PJ.+Robust statistics+1981::UNIT-ROOT TESTS WITH CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY+KIM, KW; SCHMIDT, P+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+OCT 1993::UNIT-ROOT TESTS BASED ON M-ESTIMATORS+LUCAS, A+ECONOMETRIC THEORY+JUN 1995::AN OUTLIER ROBUST UNIT-ROOT TEST WITH AN APPLICATION TO THE EXTENDED NELSON-PLOSSER DATA+LUCAS, A+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+MAR-APR 1995::no title+Maddala, G.

The estimator of mean obtained from proposed technique remains better than the estimators obtained from ratio or mean methods of imputation. The mean squared error of the resultant estimator is less than that of the estimator obtained on the basis of ratio method of imputation for the optimum choice of parameters. An estimator for estimating a parameter involved in the process of new method of imputation has been discussed. The MSE expressions for the proposed estimators have been derived analytically and compared empirically. Product method of imputation for negatively correlated variables has also been introduced.

On dependency in double-hurdle models,STATISTICAL PAPERS,10.1007/BF02926011,OCT 2003,20,16,"In microeconometrics, consumption data is typically zero-inflated due to many individuals recording, for one reason or another, no consumption. A mixture model can be appropriate for statistical analysis of such data, with the Dependent Double-Hurdle model (DDH hereafter) one specification that is frequently adopted in econometric practice. Essentially, the DDH model is designed to explain individual demand through a simultaneous two-step process: a market participation decision (first hurdle), and a consumption level decision (second hurdle) - a non-zero correlation/covariance parameter allows for dependency between the hurdles. A significant feature of the majority of empirical DDH studies has been the lack of support for the existence of dependency. This empirical phenomenon is studied from a theoretical perspective using examples based on the bivariate normal, bivariate logistic, and bivariate Poisson distributions. The Fisher Information matrix for the parameters of the model is considered, especially the component corresponding to the dependency parameter. The main finding is that the DDH model contains too little statistical information to support estimation of dependency, even when dependency is truly present. Consequently, the paper calls for the elimination of attempts to estimate dependency using the DDH framework. The advantage of this strategy is that it permits flexible modelling: some possibilities are proposed.","dependency,weak identification,Fisher's information","CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION,DEMAND,CHEESE","Smith, MD@Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Smith, MD@University of Sydney","Smith, Murray@http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5363-4184","Modelling heterogeneity in survival analysis by the compound Poisson distribution+Aalen, OO.+Ann Appl Probab+1992::UNITED-STATES CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION - THE CASE OF LOW-INCOME WOMEN+BLAYLOCK, JR; BLISARD, WN+AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+AUG 1992::BIVARIATE ALTERNATIVES TO THE TOBIT-MODEL+BLUNDELL, R; MEGHIR, C+JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS+JAN-FEB 1987::CONSUMERS DECISIONS WHETHER OR NOT TO PURCHASE MEAT - A DOUBLE HURDLE ANALYSIS OF SINGLE ADULT HOUSEHOLDS+BURTON, M; TOMLINSON, M; YOUNG, T+JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS+MAY 1994::SOME STATISTICAL MODELS FOR LIMITED DEPENDENT VARIABLES WITH APPLICATION TO DEMAND FOR DURABLE GOODS+CRAGG, JG+ECONOMETRICA+1971::Count data models for a credit scoring system+Dionne, G; Artis, M; Guillen, M.+Journal of Empirical Finance+1996::Double-hurdle model with bivariate normal errors: an application to US rice demand+Gao, X.

Let us assume that the sampling design depends on a function of an auxiliary variable called an auxiliary statistic like: the sample mean or the sample variance. Under the conditional versions of these designs several estimators of the population mean are considered: the Horvitz-Thompson statistic, ratio and regression type estimators.

The unbiasedness and accuracy of the strategies are considered. The empirical example of the accuracy comparisons of strategies is developed. The conditional strategies could improve the accuracy of estimation and protect it against outliers observations.","conditional strategy,conditional sampling design,auxiliary variable,ratio estimator,regression estimator,Horvitz-Thompson statistic,inclussion probabilities,bias",,"Wywial, J@Univ Econ, Dept Stat, PL-40226 Katowice, Poland","Wywial, J@University of Economics in Katowice",not exist,"A GENERALIZATION OF SAMPLING WITHOUT REPLACEMENT FROM A FINITE UNIVERSE+HORVITZ, DG; THOMPSON, DJ+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1952::no title+IACHAN R+J STAT PLANNING INFE+1985::Estimating totals and distribution functions using auxiliary information at the estimation stage+Rao, J.N.K.+Journal of Official Statistics+1994::Conditional inference in survey sampling+Rao, J.N.K.+Survey Methodology+1985::no title+ROYALL RM+J AM STAT ASS+1981::no title+Sarndal, C.-E.; Swensson, B.; Wretman, J.+Model Assisted Survey Sampling+1991::no title+SARNDAL CE+J AM STAT ASS+1981::no title+Thompson, M.

We have suggested a family of shrinkage estimators (T)over asterisk((p)), for mu(2) with its mean squared error formula. A condition is obtained in which the suggested estimator (T)over asterisk((p)) is more efficient than Srivastava et al's (1980) estimator T-min. Numerical illustrations have been carried out to demonstrate the merits of the constructed estimator (T)over asterisk((p)) over T-min. It is observed that some of these estimators offer improvements over T-min particularly when the population is heterogeneous and sigma(2) is in the vicinity of sigma(0)(2).","shrinkage estimators,bias,mean squared error,normal population",EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION,"Singh, HP@Vikram Univ, Sch Studies Stat, Ujjain 456010, Madhya Pradesh, India::Shukla, SK@Vikram Univ, Sch Studies Stat, Ujjain 456010, Madhya Pradesh, India","Singh, HP@Vikram University::Shukla, SK@Vikram University",not exist,"no title+BHATNAGAR S+J IND SOC AGRIL STAT+1986::no title+DAS B+CAL STAT ASS B+1975::no title+GNOT S+J MULTI ANAL+1995::no title+GOVINDARAJULU Z+STAT APPL RES JUSE A+1972::A CLASS OF SHRINKAGE ESTIMATORS FOR THE SCALE PARAMETER OF THE EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION+JANI, PN+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+APR 1991::ESTIMATION IN THE 2-PARAMETER EXPONENTIAL-DISTRIBUTION WITH PRIOR INFORMATION+KOUROUKLIS, S+IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY+SEP 1994::no title+Lehmann, E.+Theory of point estimation+1983::ESTIMATION OF MEAN BY SHRINKAGE TO A POINT+MEHTA, JS; SRINIVAS.R+JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION+1971::no title+RAO VN+J IND SOC AGRIL STAT+1982::QUADRATIC ESTIMATORS OF QUADRATIC-FUNCTIONS OF NORMAL PARAMETERS+RUKHIN, AL+JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE+FEB 1987::A generalized class of estimators for common parameters of two normal distributions with known coefficient of variation+Singh, H.P.; Katiyar, N.P.+Journal of the Indian Society of the Agricultural Statistics+1988::no title+SINGH HP+J INDIAN SOC AGR STA+1990::A class of shrinkage estimators for the variance of a normal population+Singh, HP; Singh, R+MICROELECTRONICS AND RELIABILITY+MAY 1997::Estimation of square of mean in normal population+SRIVASTAVA, V.
