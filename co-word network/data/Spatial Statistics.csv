Sampling for regression-based digital soil mapping: Closing the gap between statistical desires and operational applicability,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.06.002,AUG 2015,50,4,"With respect to sampling for regression-based digital soil mapping (DSM), the above all aim is to ensure that the spatial variability of the soil is well-captured without introducing any bias, while the design remains feasible according to operational constraints such as accessibility, man power and cost. Representativeness of the sample concerning the population to be sampled needs to be guaranteed in any regression-based modelling approach. Four selected sampling designs were adapted to show that basically any design may be optimised to represent the n-dimensional predictor space of a particular area, while selecting points is only permitted from a small accessible sub-area or from outside the area. Sampling efficiency may be evaluated based on the representation of the predictor space. However, not only each predictor's probability function but also the interaction between predictors may have to be considered, to select a representative sample. Instead of sampling a previously un-sampled area with limited accessibility, the four sampling designs may also be used to subsample an existing dataset and, thereby, optimise a suboptimal dataset based on the predictor space of the area which shall be mapped by DSM.

Saddlepoint-based bootstrap inference for the spatial dependence parameter in the lattice process,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.01.001,MAY 2015,34,1,"A saddlepoint-based bootstrap (SPBB) method for inference on the spatial dependence parameter in Gaussian lattice regression models is proposed. The method handles any estimator that is expressible as the root of a quadratic estimating equation (QEE), and includes common estimators like maximum likelihood (ML) and restricted ML (REML). Since the underlying QEE has a moment generating function in closed-form, this is inverted via the saddlepoint method to produce accurate approximations to the respective distributions of the estimators. Confidence intervals are then produced by pivoting the distribution function. The approach provides a unified perspective by viewing estimators in the simultaneous autoregressive (SAR), conditional autoregressive (CAR), and simultaneous moving average (SMA) models, through their underlying QEEs. The key assumption of monotonicity for the respective QEEs is verified, and results derived concerning their bias. Of importance for spatial modeling practitioners, is the finding that simulation studies show SPBB confidence intervals outperforming those based on standard (first-order) asymptotic theory in small to moderate sample size settings, and being orders of magnitude faster than computationally intensive approaches like the bootstrap. The methodology is illustrated on two classical lattice datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"A probabilistic approach to the prediction of area weather events, applied to precipitation",SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.01.002,MAY 2015,32,6,"In meteorology it is important to compute the probabilities of certain weather events occurring. There are a number of numerical and statistical methods for estimating the probability that a weather event occurs at a fixed location (a point). However, there are no widely applicable techniques for estimating the probability of such an event occurring in a geographical region (an area). In this paper, we propose a model-based approach for the computation of area probabilities using point probabilities. We develop this approach in the context of estimating the probability of the meteorological event 'occurrence of precipitation'. We treat the point and area probabilities as coverage probabilities of a germ-grain model, where the grains can roughly be interpreted as precipitation cells. The germ-grain model is completely characterized by a sequence of local intensities and a grain size. We compute these model characteristics using available point probabilities. A non-negative leastsquares approach is used to determine the local intensities and a semivariogram estimation technique is used to find the grain size. We are then able to determine area probabilities either analytically or by repeated simulation of the germ-grain model. We validate our model, using radar observations to assess the precision of the computed probabilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Equivalent kriging,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.01.004,MAY 2015,38,4,"Most modern spatially indexed datasets are very large, with sizes commonly ranging from tens of thousands to millions of locations. Spatial analysis often focuses on spatial smoothing using the geostatistical technique known as kriging. Kriging requires covariance matrix computations whose complexity scales with the cube of the number of spatial locations, making analysis infeasible or impossible with large datasets. We introduce an approach to kriging in the presence of large datasets called equivalent kriging, which relies on approximating the kriging weight function using an equivalent kernel, requiring presence of a nontrivial nugget effect. Resulting kriging calculations are extremely fast and feasible in the presence of massive spatial datasets. We derive closed form kriging approximations for multiresolution classes of spatial processes, as well as under any stationary model, including popular choices such as the Matern. The theoretical justification for equivalent kriging also leads to a correction term for irregularly spaced observations that also reduces edge effects near the domain boundary. For large sample sizes, equivalent kriging is shown to outperform covariance tapering in an example. Equivalent kriging is additionally illustrated on multiple simulated datasets, and a monthly average precipitation dataset whose size prohibits traditional geostatistical approaches.

Use of spatial statistics to investigate early forest degradation activities as detected from satellite images,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.01.003,MAY 2015,31,1,"Selective logging gives currently a major contribution to ongoing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonia. The spatial distribution of log landing sites (LLS), i.e. the sites where logged trees are collected, serves as a proxy to the intensity of selective logging activities. In this study we analysed the LLS pattern in a study area that has a rapid deforestation. Actual LLS locations were extracted from a Landsat image of 2000 that covers a large part of the study area. We first used the inhomogeneous J-function. A kernel bandwidth of 20 km best modelled the non-stationarity, showing a strongly clustered LLS distribution. Second, the Area-interaction point process model incorporating information about distance of LLS to roads and to clear-cut deforested areas was applied.

Cluster models for random particle aggregates-Morphological statistics and collision distance,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.03.002,MAY 2015,30,0,"In this paper, new models for particle-cluster and cluster-cluster-like aggregates are investigated through detailed Monte Carlo simulation in order to model aggregation of micro-sized particles in turbulent flows.

These structures are built up by mechanisms which occur, for instance, in homogeneous isotropic turbulence flows. In contrast to other agglomeration models they are not based on Brownian motion and can be studied without a predefined motion field. The models are compared among each other in two and three dimensions with respect to several morphological properties, such as Feret diameter, radius of gyration, convexity, aspect ratio, fractal dimension, pair correlation and coordination number averaged over hundreds of thousands of aggregates of each size. It is shown that real particle aggregates generated in a turbulent regime can be modeled well using one of these approaches.

An important part is devoted to the question how these aggregates can be approximated by spherical particles. For this, the collision distance to other particles is used, measured and approximated for both aggregate models. It can be useful for calculations related to agglomeration kernels in the framework of Smoluchowski's coagulation equation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the current work is to decide which of the two processes each point belongs to. We construct an MCMC algorithm which estimates the parameters of the superposition model and obtains posterior probabilities for each point of being a Strauss point. The algorithm is evaluated in a simulation study. Finally, it is applied to our motivating data set containing the locations of air bubbles, some of which are noise, in an Antarctic ice core.

Quantifying uncertainty for temperature maps derived from computer models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.03.005,MAY 2015,28,2,"Computer models are often deterministic simulators used to predict several environmental phenomena. Such models do not associate any measure of uncertainty with their output since they are derived from deterministic specifications. However, many sources of uncertainty exist in constructing and employing numerical models.

We are motivated by temperature maps arising from the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) model, a regional short-term weather forecast model for the continental United States (US) which provides forecast maps without associated uncertainty.

Despite a rapidly growing literature on uncertainty quantification, there is little regarding statistical methods for attaching uncertainty to model output without information about how deterministic predictions are created. Although numerical models produce deterministic surfaces, the output is not the 'true' value of the process and, given the true value and the model output, the associated error is not stochastic. However, under suitable stochastic modeling, this error can be interpreted as a random unknown. Then, weinfer about this error using a Bayesian specification within a data fusion setting, fusing the computer model data with some external validation data collected independently over the same spatial domain. Illustratively, we apply our modeling approach to obtain an uncertainty map associated with RUC forecasts over the northeastern US. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Conditional simulations of the extremal t process: Application to fields of extreme precipitation,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.04.003,MAY 2015,49,4,"The last decade has seen max-stable processes emerge as a powerful tool for the statistical modeling of spatial extremes and there are increasing works using them in a climate framework. One recent utilization of max-stable processes in this context is for conditional simulations that provide empirical distribution of a spatial field conditioned by observed values in some locations. In this work conditional simulations are investigated for the extremal t process taking benefits of its spectral construction.

The methodology of conditional simulations proposed by Dombry et al. (2013) for Brown-Resnick and Schlather models is adapted for the extremal t process with some original improvements which enlarge the possible number of conditional points. A simulation study enables to highlight the role of the different parameters of the model and to emphasize the importance of the steps of the algorithm.

An application is performed on precipitation data in the south of France where extreme precipitation events (Cevenol) may generate major floods. This shows that the model and the algorithm perform well provided the stationary assumptions are fulfilled. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A class of Matern-like covariance functions for smooth processes on a sphere,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.11.001,FEB 2015,24,8,"There have been noticeable advancements in developing parametric covariance models for spatial and spatio-temporal data with various applications to environmental problems. However, literature on covariance models for processes defined on the surface of a sphere with great circle distance as a distance metric is still sparse, due to its mathematical difficulties. It is known that the popular Matern covariance function, with smoothness parameter greater than 0.5, is not valid for processes on the surface of a sphere with great circle distance. We introduce an approach to produce Matern-like covariance functions for smooth processes on the surface of a sphere that are valid with great circle distance. The resulting model is isotropic and positive definite on the surface of a sphere with great circle distance, with a natural extension for nonstationarity case. We present extensive numerical comparisons of our model, with a Matern covariance model using great circle distance as well as chordal distance. We apply our new covariance model class to sea level pressure data, known to be smooth compared to other climate variables, from the CMIP5 climate model outputs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Deviation test construction and power comparison for marked spatial point patterns,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.11.004,FEB 2015,35,11,"Deviation tests play an important role in testing distributional hypotheses in point process statistics. Such tests are based on differences between empirical summary functions and their theoretical counterparts, which depend on a distance variable r in a user-specified interval I. These differences are summarized to a single number, which serves then as the test statistic u. Statistical experience indicates that different distances r have different influence on u. We propose scalings of the differences to equalize the influence of the distances and show that the power of deviation tests can be improved by them. We further study how the power is affected by the other elements of deviation tests, which are the choice of the summary function, the deviation measure and the interval I. We consider in detail the construction of deviation tests for the particular case of testing the random labeling hypothesis, i.e. independence of the marks of a marked point process. By a large simulation study we come to clear statements about the role of the test elements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of scaling by a data example from the literature.

On the inverse geostatistical problem of inference on missing locations,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.11.002,FEB 2015,11,0,"The standard geostatistical problem is to predict the values of a spatially continuous phenomenon, S(x) say, at locations x using data (y(i), x(i)) : i = 1,..., n where yi is the realisation at location xi of S(x(i)), or of a random variable Y-i that is stochastically related to S(x(i)). In this paper we address the inverse problem of predicting the locations of observed measurements y. We discuss how knowledge of the sampling mechanism can and should inform a prior specification, pi(x) say, for the joint distribution of the measurement locations X = {x(i) : i = 1,..., n}, and propose an efficient Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for drawing samples from the resulting predictive distribution of the missing elements of X. An important feature in many applied settings is that this predictive distribution is multi-modal, which severely limits the usefulness of simple summary measures such as the mean or median. We present three simulated examples to demonstrate the importance of the specification for pi(x) and show how a one-by-one approach can lead to substantially incorrect inferences in the case of multiple unknown locations. We also analyse rainfall data from Parana State, Brazil to show how, under additional assumptions, an empirical estimate of pi(x) can be used when no prior information on the sampling design is available.

A two-step method for mode choice estimation with socioeconomic and spatial information,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.12.002,FEB 2015,35,5,"Individuals choose the travel mode considering their own characteristics, those of the journey and the transport systems. Despite the current wide availability of georeferenced information and the forthcoming of Spatial Travel Demand Analysis as a research field, only a few studies have integrated the mode choice modeling methods and the geographical information. In this context, the goal of this paper is to apply a two-step-method to estimate the mode choice based on the geographical position and socioeconomic attributes. From a database of household surveys in the city of Sao Carlos (Brazil) the first step of the method is to select the attributes which most influence the mode choice with a Decision Tree (DT). After comparing the performance of the DT with a Multinomial Logit Model, an Ordinary Kriging is applied to predict the mode choice under the spatial locations. The DT has shown to be effective in estimating the mode choice and selecting the variables to be kriged, which allowed predicting the mode choice of travelers based on geographical location. The proposed method may be an alternative to the traditional approaches in both non-spatial and spatial modeling, by enabling mode choice estimations given geographic coordinates of households.

When does the screening effect not hold?,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.12.003,FEB 2015,38,2,"The screening effect is the phenomenon of nearby observations yielding a good approximation to the optimal linear predictor of a spatial process based on a large set of observations. In addition to its obvious relevance to computation with large spatial datasets, knowing when a screening effect occurs is key to understanding the behavior of spatial processes. This work provides the first general results showing when an asymptotic screening effect does not hold by considering the prediction of a weakly stationary, isotropic process on R-d at a single location based on observing the process everywhere on R-d with white noise and letting the variance of the white noise tend to 0. The main result shows that a screening effect does not hold if the isotropic spectral density fluctuates too much at high frequencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Bayesian inference for the dissimilarity index in the presence of spatial autocorrelation,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.12.001,FEB 2015,42,6,"The degree of segregation between two or more sub-populations has been studied since the 1950s, and examples include segregation along racial and religious lines. The Dissimilarity index is a commonly used measure to numerically quantify segregation, using population level data for a set of areal units that comprise a city or country. However, the construction of this index usually ignores the spatial autocorrelation present in the data, and it is also typically presented without a measure of uncertainty. Therefore we propose a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach for estimating the Dissimilarity index and quantifying its uncertainty, which utilises a conditional autoregressive model to account for the spatial autocorrelation in the data. This modelling approach is motivated by a study of religious segregation in Northern Ireland, and allows us to quantify whether the dissimilarity index has exhibited a substantial change between 2001 and 2011.

Using third-order cumulants to investigate spatial variation: A case study on the porosity of the Bunter Sandstone,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.02.001,FEB 2015,30,0,"The multivariate cumulants characterize aspects of the spatial variability of a regionalized variable. A centred multivariate Gaussian random variable, for example, has zero third-order cumulants. In this paper it is shown how the third-order cumulants can be used to test the plausibility of the assumption of multivariate normality for the porosity of an important formation, the Bunter Sandstone in the North Sea. The results suggest that the spatial variability of this variable deviates from multivariate normality, and that this assumption may lead to misleading inferences about, for example, the uncertainty attached to kriging predictions.

Specialized agglomerations with Lattice data: Model and detection,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.11.003,FEB 2015,66,1,This paper develops new statistical and computational methods for the automatic detection of spatial clusters displaying an over- or under- relative specialization spatial pattern. A probability model is used to provide a basis for a space partition into clusters representing homogeneous portions of space as far as the probability of locating a primary unit is concerned. A cluster made of contiguous regions is called an agglomeration. A greedy algorithm detects specialized agglomerations through a model selection criteria. A random permutation test evaluates whether the contiguity property is significant. Finally this algorithm is run on Argentinean data. Evaluating the proposed methodology concludes the paper.

A quality assessment of eigenvector spatial filtering based parameter estimates for the normal probability model,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.04.001,NOV 2014,33,5,"Eigenvector spatial filtering, which introduces a subset of eigenvectors extracted from a spatial weights matrix as synthetic control variables in a regression model specification, furnishes a solution to extraordinarily intricate statistical modeling problems involving spatial dependences. It accounts for spatial autocorrelation in standard specifications of regression models. But the quality of the resulting regression parameter estimates has yet to be ascertained. The estimator properties to establish include unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate these estimator properties for linear regression parameters based on eigenvector spatial filtering, including a comparison with the simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model. Eigenvector spatial filtering methodology requires the judicious selection of eigenvectors, whose number tends to increase with both level of linear regression residual spatial autocorrelation and the number of areal units. A logistic regression description of the number of eigenvectors selected in a simulation pilot study suggests estimator consistency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial generalized linear mixed models with multivariate CAR models for areal data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.05.001,NOV 2014,22,2,"Disease mapping studies have been widely performed with considering only one disease in the estimated models. Simultaneous modeling of different diseases can also be a valuable tool both from the epidemiological and from the statistical point of view. In particular, when we have several measurements recorded at each spatial location, we need to consider multivariate models in order to handle the dependence among the multivariate components as well as the spatial dependence between locations. These models can be studied in the class of spatial generalized linear mixed models (SGLMMs). It is well known that the frequentist analysis of SGLMMs is computationally difficult. Recently, there are a few papers which explored multivariate spatial models for areal data adopting the Bayesian framework as the natural inferential approach. We propose to use an approach, which yields to maximum likelihood estimation, to conduct frequentist analysis of SGLMMs with multivariate conditional autoregressive models for areal data. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through simulation studies and also by a real dataset. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial Fay-Herriot models for small area estimation with functional covariates,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.07.001,NOV 2014,40,16,"The Fay-Herriot (FH) model is widely used in small area estimation and uses auxiliary information to reduce estimation variance at undersampled locations. We extend the type of covariate information used in the FH model to include functional covariates, such as social-media search loads or remote-sensing images (e.g., in crop-yield surveys). The inclusion of these functional covariates is facilitated through a two-stage dimension-reduction approach that includes a Karhunen-Loeve expansion followed by stochastic search variable selection. Additionally, the importance of modeling spatial autocorrelation has recently been recognized in the FH model; our model utilizes the intrinsic conditional autoregressive class of spatial models in addition to functional covariates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation and analysis of data from the American Community Survey. We use Google Trends searches over time as functional covariates to analyze relative changes in rates of percent household Spanish-speaking in the eastern half of the United States.

Skew-Gaussian random fields,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.08.001,NOV 2014,32,8,"Skewness is often present in a wide range of spatial prediction problems, and modeling it in the spatial context remains a challenging problem. In this study a skew-Gaussian random field is considered. The skew-Gaussian random field is constructed by using the multivariate closed skew-normal distribution, which is a generalization of the traditional normal distribution. We present a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for simulating realizations efficiently from the random field, and an algorithm for estimating parameters by maximum likelihood with a Monte Carlo approximation of the likelihood. We demonstrate and evaluate the algorithms on synthetic cases. The skewness in the skew-Gaussian random field is found to be strongly influenced by the spatial coupling in the field, and the parameter estimators appear as consistent with increasing size of the random field. Moreover, we use the closed skew-normal distribution in a multivariate random field predictive setting on real seismic data from the Sleipner field in the North Sea. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Point-pattern analysis on the sphere,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.10.001,NOV 2014,35,5,"Many important environmental, geographic, and geophysical variables are observed at the global scale, so it is important to extend point-pattern methods to the sphere. Here, we develop the K function on the sphere and then evaluate several global data structures and networks. The assumption of complete spatial randomness (CSR) gives a K function that is proportional to the square of distance in Euclidean space, but we find that CSR on the sphere is proportional to 1-cos(angular distance). To evaluate the spherical K function, we analyze two global data structures: latitude-longitude and equidistant hexagonal grids. Due to over-representation of polar regions, latitude-longitude grids produce clustered point patterns. The hexagonal grid is equal-area on the sphere and produces a dispersed point pattern. We also analyze the structure of an observing system for global climate research that is intended to have relatively even spatial coverage. We find that, due to its coastal and continental biases, the climate-station network produces clustered point patterns over a range of distances. Our focus is on planetaryscale geographic point distributions, but we foresee applications of spherical K functions in disciplines such as astronomy, geodetics, anatomy, and neuroscience.

Modelling skewed spatial random fields through the spatial vine copula,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.01.001,NOV 2014,37,24,"Studying phenomena that follow a skewed distribution and entail an extremal behaviour is important in many disciplines. How to describe and model the dependence of skewed spatial random fields is still a challenging question. Especially when one is interested in interpolating a sample from a spatial random field that exhibits extreme events, classical geostatistical tools like kriging relying on the Gaussian assumption fail in reproducing the extremes. Originating from the multivariate extreme value theory partly driven by financial mathematics, copulas emerged in recent years being capable of describing different kinds of joint tail behaviours beyond the Gaussian realm. In this paper spatial vine copulas are introduced that are parametrized by distance and allow to include extremal behaviour of a spatial random field. The newly introduced distributions are fitted to the widely studied emergency and routine scenario data set from the spatial interpolation comparison 2004 (SIC2004). The presented spatial vine copula ranks within the top 5 approaches and is superior to all approaches in terms of the mean absolute error. (C) 2014 The Author.

Spatially significant cluster detection,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.03.001,NOV 2014,50,12,"Cluster discovery techniques are a fundamental group of exploratory methods designed to identify areas exhibiting elevated levels of disease, risk, danger, etc. Given the intent of cluster detection, spatial structure plays an important role and must be taken into account appropriately if meaningful clusters are to be found. This paper discusses contiguity and the ways in which it is central to local clusters that may be of interest for planners, managers and policy makers. While spatial contiguity is widely considered an important condition of a cluster, most detection approaches employ a priori artificial structure, leading to disingenuous significance and unintended spatial biases that hinders meaningful discovery and interpretation. The basis for significance is reviewed, and methods for maximizing likelihood are detailed. An approach is presented for addressing spatial contiguity explicitly in cluster detection without the use of arbitrarily shaped scan windows. A case study using crime events within a major urban region is presented, with empirical results used to illustrate capabilities for identifying significant and meaningful clusters.

This spatial scan test seems to be very powerful against any arbitrarily-distributed cluster alternative.

Putting spatial statistics (back) on the map,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.03.007,AUG 2014,47,5,"The literature in Geographical Information Science and Statistical Science often contains calls for analysts to ""think spatially'' and to ""think statistically'', respectively, in order to gain better insight into proposed hypotheses. A central element of these calls involves the development of a spatial intuition or a statistical intuition, i.e., conceptual ways of framing questions, incorporating available data, calculating quantitative summaries, interpreting outcomes, and providing empirical answers from either a spatial or a statistical perspective. In this paper, I draw on past experience to identify and illustrate the potential for ""spatial statistical thinking'', that is, the development of a spatial statistical intuition. Several examples illustrate the potential for a more explicit development of such intuition drawing simultaneously from both spatial analysis and statistics. As a step in this direction, I stress the importance of maintaining a spatial conceptual framework in the application and interpretation of spatial statistical methods, i.e., the importance of spatial interpretation of spatial statistics.

On the local odds ratio between points and marks in marked point processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.12.002,AUG 2014,29,2,"Marked point processes are widely used stochastic models for representing a finite number of natural hazard events located in space and time and their data often associate event measurements (i.e. marks) with event locations (i.e. points). An interesting statistical problem of marked point processes is to measure and estimate the localized dependence between points and marks. To solve this problem, an approach of local odds ratio is proposed, where the local odds ratio is defined by the localized ratio of the relative risk for an event to have a small mark to the relative risk to have a large mark. To establish the approach, the article presents definition, estimation, and statistical properties. To justify the usefulness of the approach, the article presents two particular examples in natural hazards: a forest wildfire study and an earthquake study. It finds that values of local odds ratios are mostly likely low in one subarea but high in another subarea, which indicates that events with large mark values are mostly likely to appear in the former subarea but less likely to appear in the latter subarea. It is expected that the proposed approach will be widely applicable in natural hazard studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial econometric panel data model specification: A Bayesian approach,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.02.002,AUG 2014,10,20,"Taking a Bayesian perspective on model uncertainty for static panel data models proposed in the spatial econometrics literature considerably simplifies the task of selecting an appropriate model. A wide variety of alternative specifications that include various combinations of spatial dependence in lagged values of the dependent variable, spatial lags of the explanatory variables, as well as dependence in the model disturbances have been the focus of a literature on various statistical tests for distinguishing between these numerous specifications.

A Bayesian model uncertainty argument is advanced that logically implies we can simplify this task by focusing on only two model specifications. One of these, labeled the spatial Durbin model (SDM) implies global spatial spillovers, while the second, labeled a spatial Durbin error model (SDEM) leads to local spatial spillovers. A Bayesian approach to determining an appropriate local or global specification, SDEM versus SDM is set forth here for static panel variants of these two models.

Approximate Bayesian inference for spatial econometrics models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.01.002,AUG 2014,24,15,"In this paper we explore the use of the Integrated Laplace Approximation (INLA) for Bayesian inference in some widely used models in Spatial Econometrics. Bayesian inference often relies on computationally intensive simulation methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. When only marginal inference is needed, INLA provides a fast and accurate estimate of the posterior marginals of the parameters in the model.

Furthermore, we have compared the results provided by these models to those obtained with a more general class of Generalised Linear Models with random effects. In these models, spatial auto-correlation is modelled by means of correlated Gaussian random effects.

We also discuss a procedure to extend the class of models that the R-INLA software can fit. This approach is based on conditioning on one or more parameters so that the resulting models can be fitted with R-INLA across sets of values of the fixed parameters. The posterior marginals of these parameters of interest are then obtained by combining the marginal likelihoods (which are conditioned on the values of the parameters fixed) of the fitted models and a prior on these parameters. This approach can also be used to fit even more general models.

Finally, we discuss the use of all these models on two datasets based on median housing prices for census tracts in Boston and the probability of business re-opening in New Orleans in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina.

Exploration of the use of Bayesian modeling of gradients for censored spatiotemporal data from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.03.002,AUG 2014,18,1,"This paper develops a hierarchical framework for identifying spatiotemporal patterns in data with a high degree of censoring using the gradient process. To do this, we impute censored values using a sampling-based inverse CDF method within our Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, thereby avoiding burdensome integration and facilitating efficient estimation of other model parameters. We illustrate use of our methodology using a simulated data example, and uncover the danger of simply substituting a space- and time-constant function of the level of detection for all missing values. We then fit our model to area measurement data of volatile organic compound (VOC) air concentrations collected on vessels supporting the response and clean-up efforts of the Deepwater Horizon oil release that occurred starting April 20, 2010. These data contained a high percentage of observations below the detectable limits of the measuring instrument. Despite this, we were still able to make some interesting discoveries, including elevated levels of VOC near the site of the oil well on June 26th. Using the results from this preliminary analysis, we hope to inform future research on the Deepwater Horizon study, including the use of gradient methods for assigning workers to exposure categories.

Space-time variability in burglary risk: A Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling approach,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.03.006,AUG 2014,53,18,"Modelling spatio-temporal offence data contributes to our understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of the risk of becoming a victim of crime and has implications for policing. Space-time interactions are deeply embedded both empirically and theoretically into many areas of criminology. In this paper, we apply a familiar Bayesian spatio-temporal model to explore the space-time variation in burglary risk in Peterborough, England, between 2005 and 2008. However, we extend earlier work with this model by presenting a novel two-stage method for classifying areas into crime hotspots, coldspots or neither and studying the temporal dynamics of areas within each risk category. A further contribution of this paper is the inclusion of covariates into the model in order to explain the space-time classification of areas. We discuss the advantages of, and identify future directions for, this form of modelling for analysing offence patterns in space and time. Implications for crime research and policing are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Modelling of the spatio-temporal distribution of rat sightings in an urban environment,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2014.03.005,AUG 2014,30,4,"The brown rat lives with man in a wide variety of environmental contexts and adversely affects public health by transmission of diseases, bites, and allergies. Understanding behavioural aspects of pest species can contribute to their effective management and control. We report an analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of rat sightings, which are directly related to rat infestation, in a district of Madrid (Spain). We first consider an empirical analysis of the first-order for the first and second order properties of the spatio-temporal point process of rat sightings, in which we model the first-order intensity function as a product of two intensity functions, one spatial and the other temporal, and use the inhomogeneous spatio-temporal K-function to estimate second order properties. We then formulate a more mechanistic model in which the conditional intensity of the point process depends explicitly on its past history. We have found that the sightings show strong seasonal variation and are strongly influenced by environmental factors related to human behaviour. We have also identified spatio-temporal clustering and interaction over and above the separate temporal and spatial components of variation in risk, and have estimated the spatial scale on which the interaction operates.

Limitations on low rank approximations for covariance matrices of spatial data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.06.003,MAY 2014,42,34,"Evaluating the likelihood function for Gaussian models when a spatial process is observed irregularly is problematic for larger datasets due to constraints of memory and calculation. If the covariance structure can be approximated by a diagonal matrix plus a low rank matrix, then both the memory and calculations needed to evaluate the likelihood function are greatly reduced. When neighboring observations are strongly correlated, much of the variation in the observations can be captured by low frequency components, so the low rank approach might be thought to work well in this setting. Through both theory and numerical results, where the diagonal matrix is assumed to be a multiple of the identity, this paper shows that the low rank approximation sometimes performs poorly in this setting. In particular, an approximation in which observations are split into contiguous blocks and independence across blocks is assumed often provides a much better approximation to the likelihood than a low rank approximation requiring similar memory and calculations. An example with satellite-based measurements of total column ozone shows that these results are relevant to real data and that the low rank models also can be highly statistically inefficient for spatial interpolation.

Spatial models with explanatory variables in the dependence structure,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.06.002,MAY 2014,40,23,"Geostatistical models have traditionally been stationary. However, physical knowledge about underlying spatial processes often requires models with non-stationary dependence structures. Thus, there has been an interest in the literature to provide flexible models and computationally efficient methods for non-stationary phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate that the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to spatial modelling provides a flexible class of non-stationary models where explanatory variables can be easily included in the dependence structure. In addition, the SPDE approach enables computationally efficient Bayesian inference with integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) available through the R-package r-inla. We illustrate the suggested modelling framework with a case study of annual precipitation in southern Norway, and compare a non-stationary model with dependence structure governed by elevation to a stationary model. Further, we use a simulation study to explore the annual precipitation models. We investigate identifiability of model parameters and whether the deviance information criterion (DIC) is able to distinguish datasets from the non-stationary and stationary models.

Scaling intrinsic Gaussian Markov random field priors in spatial modelling,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.06.004,MAY 2014,23,28,"In Bayesian hierarchical regression models, intrinsic Gaussian Markov random fields (IGMRFs) are commonly applied to model underlying spatial or temporal dependency structures. IGMRFs have a scaled precision matrix that reflects the neighbourhood structure of the model, while the scaling is represented as a random precision parameter. The hyperprior chosen for the precision parameter influences the degree of smoothness of the resulting field and this can have a strong effect on posterior results. We suggest that hyperpriors for the precision parameters should be selected according to the type of IGMRF used. Also, hyperpriors for different types of IGMRFs can be selected to give the same degree of smoothness, a priori. This is achieved by mapping the random precision to the marginal standard deviation of the IGMRF and recalculate hyperpriors used for different models. Also, the parameters of the hyperprior can be interpreted in terms of the marginal standard deviation. The given ideas are demonstrated by analysing two different types of spatial data in R-INLA, including a district-level analysis of survival data and the analysis of a spatial point pattern discretized to a grid.

Wavelet methods in interpolation of high-frequency spatial-temporal pressure,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.07.001,MAY 2014,32,1,"The location-scale and whitening properties of wavelets make them more favorable for interpolating high-frequency monitoring data than Fourier-based methods. In the past, wavelets have been used to simplify the dependence structure in multiple time or spatial series, but little has been done to apply wavelets as a modeling tool in a space-time setting, or, in particular, to take advantage of the localization of wavelets to capture the local dynamic characteristics of high-frequency meteorological data. This paper analyzes minute-by-minute atmospheric pressure data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program using different wavelet coefficient structures at different scales and incorporating spatial structure into the model. This approach of modeling space-time processes using wavelets produces accurate point predictions with low uncertainty estimates, and also enables interpolation of available data from sparse monitoring stations to a high density grid and production of meteorological maps on large spatial and temporal scales.

A comparison of spatial smoothing methods for small area estimation with sampling weights,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.12.001,MAY 2014,32,15,"Small area estimation (SAE) is an important endeavor in many fields and is used for resource allocation by both public health and government organizations. Often, complex surveys are carried out within areas, in which case it is common for the data to consist only of the response of interest and an associated sampling weight, reflecting the design. While it is appealing to use spatial smoothing models, and many approaches have been suggested for this endeavor, it is rare for spatial models to incorporate the weighting scheme, leaving the analysis potentially subject to bias. To examine the properties of various approaches to estimation we carry out a simulation study, looking at bias due to both non-response and non-random sampling. We also carry out SAE of smoking prevalence in Washington State, at the zip code level, using data from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The computation times for the methods we compare are short, and all approaches are implemented in R using currently available packages. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Tapered composite likelihood for spatial max-stable models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.07.003,MAY 2014,30,10,"Spatial extreme value analysis is useful to environmental studies, in which extreme value phenomena are of interest and meaningful spatial patterns can be discerned. Max-stable process models are able to describe such phenomena. This class of models is asymptotically justified to characterize the spatial dependence among extremes. However, likelihood inference is challenging for such models because their corresponding joint likelihood is unavailable and only bivariate or trivariate distributions are known. In this paper, we propose a tapered composite likelihood approach by utilizing lower dimensional marginal likelihoods for inference on parameters of various max-stable process models. We consider a weighting strategy based on a ''taper range'' to exclude distant pairs or triples. The ''optimal taper range'' is selected to maximize various measures of the Godambe information associated with the tapered composite likelihood function. This method substantially reduces the computational cost and improves the efficiency over equally weighted composite likelihood estimators. We illustrate its utility with simulation experiments and an analysis of rainfall data in Switzerland. Published by Elsevier B.

Hierarchical second-order analysis of replicated spatial point patterns with non-spatial covariates,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.07.006,MAY 2014,44,4,"In this paper we propose a method for incorporating the effect of non-spatial covariates into the spatial second-order analysis of replicated point patterns. The variance stabilizing transformation of Ripley's K function is used to summarize the spatial arrangement of points, and the relationship between this summary function and covariates is modelled by hierarchical Gaussian process regression. In particular, we investigate how disease status and some other covariates affect the level and scale of clustering of epidermal nerve fibres. The data are point patterns with replicates extracted from skin blister samples taken from 47 subjects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

A Bayesian spatial model with auxiliary covariates to assess and adjust nonignorable nonresponse,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.11.002,MAY 2014,32,1,"Nonresponse is a persistent problem in surveys because results from respondents only are subject to nonresponse bias. Many methods have been developed to deal with ignorable (missing at random) nonresponse data. In this paper, we provide a method to assess and adjust nonignorable (not missing at random) nonresponse bias in a small area estimation problem. We propose a bivariate Bayesian hierarchical linear mixed model to estimate both satisfaction rate and response rate. This model uses spatial dependencies among subdomains and auxiliary information from sample units to assess and adjust nonresponse bias. In addition, it explicitly includes a parameter that indicates whether the nonresponse is ignorable or not. The method is used to analyze the 2001 Missouri Deer Hunter Attitude Survey (MDHAS). The result shows that the nonresponse in MDHAS is nonignorable. Hunter age and the number of deer harvested have strong effects on satisfaction and response rates, and spatial dependencies are strong amongst counties of hunters' residences. The estimated satisfaction rates are lower after adjusting for nonresponse bias. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Detecting correlation between allele frequencies and environmental variables as a signature of selection. A fast computational approach for genome-wide studies,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.08.001,MAY 2014,14,21,"Genomic regions (or loci) displaying outstanding correlation with some environmental variables are likely to be under selection and this is the rationale of recent methods of identifying selected loci and retrieving functional information about them. To be efficient, such methods need to be able to disentangle the potential effect of environmental variables from the confounding effect of population history. For the routine analysis of genome-wide datasets, one also needs fast inference and model selection algorithms. We propose a method based on an explicit spatial model which is an instance of spatial generalized linear mixed model (SGLMM). For inference, we make use of the INLA-SPDE theoretical and computational framework developed by Rue et al. (2009) and Lindgren et al. (2011). The method we propose allows one to quantify the correlation between genotypes and environmental variables. It works for the most common types of genetic markers, obtained either at the individual or at the population level. Analyzing the simulated data produced under a geostatistical model then under an explicit model of selection, we show that the method is efficient. We also re-analyze a dataset relative to nineteen pine weevils (Hylobius abietis) populations across Europe. The method proposed appears also as a statistically sound alternative to the Mantel tests for testing the association between the genetic and environmental variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Poisson kriging: A closer investigation,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.11.001,FEB 2014,23,7,"This work revisits a simple geostatistical model for the analysis of spatial count data and describes some of its main second-order properties. This geostatistical model is simpler than an alternative hierarchical model, also used for the analysis of spatial count data, so it may be more appealing to practitioners and spatial data analysts.

Pairwise likelihood inference for spatial regressions estimated on very large datasets,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.10.001,FEB 2014,51,4,"This paper proposes a pairwise likelihood specification of a spatial regression model that simplifies the derivation of the log-likelihood and leads to a closed form expression for the estimation of the parameters. With respect to the more traditional specifications of spatial autoregressive models, our method avoids the arbitrariness of the specification of a weight matrix, presents analytical and computational advantages and provides interesting interpretative insights. We establish small sample and asymptotic properties of the estimators and we derive the associated Fisher information matrix needed in confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing. We also present an illustrative example of application based on simulated data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Spatio-temporal graphical modeling with innovations based on multi-scale diffusion kernel,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.11.004,FEB 2014,40,1,"A random field of interest is observed on an undirected spatial graph over time, thereby providing a time series of dependent random fields. We propose a general modeling procedure which has the potential to explicitly quantify intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations of such dynamical system. We adopt a paradigm in which the intrinsic fluctuations correspond to a process of latent diffusion on the graph arising from stochastic interactions within the system, whereas the extrinsic fluctuations correspond to a temporal drift reflecting the effects of the environment on the system. We start with a spatio-temporal diffusion process which gives rise to the latent spatial process. This makes a bridge with the conventional Wold representation, for which the latent process represents the innovation process, and beyond that with the stochastic differential equation associated to the Fokker-Planck dynamic. The innovation process is modeled by a Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix is defined by a multi-scale diffusion kernel. This model leads to a multi-scale representation of the spatio-temporal process. We propose a statistical procedure to estimate the multi-scale structure and the model parameters in the case of the vector autoregressive model with drift. Modeling and estimation tasks are illustrated on simulated and real biological data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, the local linear estimators of the conditional cumulative distribution function and of the successive derivatives of the conditional density are constructed. Then, the asymptotic properties of these estimators, in terms of the almost-complete convergence with rates, are stated. Moreover, the usefulness of our results is illustrated through their application (a) to the spatial conditional mode estimation and (b) to the soil chemistry properties data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Sequential spatial analysis of large datasets with applications to modern earthwork compaction roller measurement values,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.07.002,NOV 2013,36,1,"In the context of road construction, modern earthwork compaction rollers equipped with sensors collect a virtually continuous flow of soil property measurements. This sequential, spatial data can be utilized to improve the quality control of the compaction process through the introduction of intelligent compaction. These roller measurement values are observed indirectly through non-linear measurement operators, non-stationary, inherently multivariate with complex correlation structures, and collected in huge quantities. The problem of modeling and estimation in a spatially correlated setting with large amounts of data is well known and many approaches can be found in the literature. Very few studies have been completed investigating sequential, spatially correlated data outside of a point process framework. We propose a sequential, spatial mixed-effects model and develop a sequential, spatial back-fitting algorithm to estimate fixed effects and several independent, spatially correlated processes. This new algorithm is demonstrated in a simulation study and applied to earthwork compaction data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Continental-scale kriging of gold-bearing commodities,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.07.004,NOV 2013,33,3,"This paper focuses on continental-scale kriging on the African continent using the gold-bearing commodities of the Gondwana Geoscience Indexing Database. The mineral layer contains over 20 000 commodities, each containing information on its ordinal interval size value. Boundaries between class intervals across the database are, however, not uniform. We perform spatial interpolation on a continental scale using the commodity gold as the binary variable. First, we select an appropriate distance metric in order to krige on an essentially spherical surface. We use this metric to implement a valid covariance function. Second, the ordinal size classes of the commodities are combined into a unique size classification. In addition, the commodity size classification is used as a proxy for data reliability and is incorporated by using a weighted variogram. The geology is used to stratify Africa into geologically homogeneous strata, leading to stratified kriging. The best model in each stratum is used to produce a map of gold commodities of Africa including the spatial uncertainties. By integrating advanced techniques with high-quality data, a state-of-the-art map of gold commodities was obtained for Africa, including the spatial uncertainties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A Gaussian Markov random field approach to convergence analysis,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.07.005,NOV 2013,45,1,"Spatial models have been widely applied in the context of growth regressions with spatial spillovers usually modelled by simultaneous autoregressions (SAR). Although largely used, such a class of models present some logical difficulties connected with the error behaviour, the lack of identifiability of the model parameters and their substantive interpretation. To overcome these logical pitfalls, in this paper we introduce a new specification of regional growth regressions by applying multivariate Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs). We discuss the theoretical properties of the proposed model and show some empirical results on the economic growth pattern of 254 NUTS-2 European regions in the period 1992-2006. We show that the proposed GMRF model is able to capture the complexity of the phenomenon including the possibility of estimating site-specific convergence parameters which may highlight clustering of regions and spatial heterogeneities in the speed of convergence.

A completely random T-tessellation model and Gibbsian extensions,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.09.003,NOV 2013,40,9,"In their 1993 paper, Arak, Clifford and Surgailis discussed a new model of random planar graph. As a particular case, that model yields tessellations with only T-vertices (T-tessellations). Using a similar approach involving Poisson lines, a new model of random T-tessellations is proposed. Campbell measures, Papangelou kernels and formulae of Georgii-Nguyen-Zessin type are translated from point process theory to random T-tessellations. It is shown that the new model shows properties similar to the Poisson point process and can therefore be considered as a completely random T-tessellation. Gibbs variants are introduced leading to models of random T-tessellations where selected features are controlled. Gibbs random T-tessellations are expected to better represent observed tessellations. As numerical experiments are a key tool for investigating Gibbs models, we derive a simulation algorithm of the Metropolis-Hastings-Green family. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial statistics to estimate peat thickness using airborne radiometric data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.05.003,AUG 2013,31,7,"Soil carbon stores are a major component of the annual returns required by EU governments to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Peat has a high proportion of soil carbon due to the relatively high carbon density of peat and organic-rich soils. For this reason it has become increasingly important to measure and model soil carbon stores and changes in peat stocks to facilitate the management of carbon changes over time. The approach investigated in this research evaluates the use of airborne geophysical (radiometric) data to estimate peat thickness using the attenuation of bedrock geology radioactivity by superficial peat cover. Remotely sensed radiometric data are validated with ground peat depth measurements combined with non-invasive geophysical surveys. Two field-based case studies exemplify and validate the results. Variography and kriging are used to predict peat thickness from point measurements of peat depth and airborne radiometric data and provide an estimate of uncertainty in the predictions. Cokriging, by assessing the degree of spatial correlation between recent remote sensed geophysical monitoring and previous peat depth models, is used to examine changes in peat stocks over time. The significance of the coregionalisation is that the spatial cross correlation between the remote and ground based data can be used to update the model of peat depth. The result is that by integrating remotely sensed data with ground geophysics, the need is reduced for extensive ground-based monitoring and invasive peat depth measurements. The overall goal is to provide robust estimates of peat thickness to improve estimates of carbon stocks. The implications from the research have a broader significance that promotes a reduction in the need for damaging onsite peat thickness measurement and an increase in the use of remote sensed data for carbon stock estimations.

Investigating local relationships between trace elements in soils and cancer data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.05.001,AUG 2013,48,8,"Medical geology research has recognised a number of potentially toxic elements (PTEs), such as arsenic, cobalt, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, vanadium, uranium and zinc, known to influence human disease by their respective deficiency or toxicity. As the impact of infectious diseases has decreased and the population ages, so cancer has become the most common cause of death in developed countries including Northern Ireland. This research explores the relationship between environmental exposure to potentially toxic elements in soil and cancer disease data across Northern Ireland. The incidences of twelve different cancer types (lung, stomach, leukaemia, oesophagus, colorectal, bladder, kidney, breast, mesothelioma, melanoma and non melanoma (NM) skin cancer both basal and squamous) were examined in the form of twenty-five coded datasets comprising aggregates over the 12 year period from 1993 to 2006. A local modelling technique, geographically weighted regression (GWR) is used to explore the relationship between environmental exposure and cancer disease data. The results show comparisons of the geographical incidence of certain cancers (stomach and NM squamous skin cancer) in relation to concentrations of certain PTEs (arsenic levels in soils and radon were identified). Findings from the research have implications for regional human health risk assessments. c (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

Modeling forest canopies with a hierarchical multi-ring Boolean model for estimating a leaf area index,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.04.007,AUG 2013,18,1,"The leaf area index (LAI), defined as half the total developed area of green photosynthetically active elements per unit horizontal ground area, is one of the key biophysical variables of vegetated surfaces. Optical devices developed to overcome the burden of time consuming, expensive and difficult to conduct sampling in tree canopies are based on the unrealistic assumption that leaves are uniformly distributed in the canopy. This assumption is violated when the leaf area density varies in the horizontal plane due to the clustering of leaves in trees. In this work, a hierarchical model in which leaves are represented as a second level Boolean model whose centers are distributed conditional on a first level Boolean model representing crowns is proposed. Crowns will be furthermore modeled as concentric rings with varying leaf density. Analytical expressions relating second order functions, such as variograms or covariance functions, to canopy structure characteristics such as LAI, leaf size, crown cover and crown radius will be established.

We combine smoothing in the time domain with spatial interpolation to model threshold exceedance probabilities and their corresponding confidence regions in a flexible framework. We then present a comprehensive study of air quality in the North-Italian region Piemonte from October 2005 through March 2006.

Multiple-point geostatistical simulation for post-processing a remotely sensed land cover classification,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.04.005,AUG 2013,58,18,"A post-processing method for increasing the accuracy of a remote sensing classification was developed and tested based on the theory of multiple-point geostatistics. Training images are used to characterise the joint variability and joint continuity of a target spatial pattern, overcoming the limitations of two-point statistical models. Conditional multiple-point simulation (MPS) was applied to a land cover classification derived from a remotely sensed image. Training data were provided in the form of ""hard"" (land cover labels), and ""soft"" constraints (class probability surfaces estimated using soft classification). The MPS post-processing method was compared to two alternatives: traditional spatial filtering (also a post-processing method) and the contextual Markov random field (MRF) classifier. The MPS approach increased the accuracy of classification relative to these alternatives, primarily as a result of increasing the accuracy of classification for curvilinear classes. Key advantages of the MPS approach are that, unlike spatial filtering and the MRF classifier, (i) it incorporates a rich model of spatial correlation in the process of smoothing the spectral classification and (ii) it has the advantage of capturing and utilising class-specific spatial training patterns, for example, classes with curvilinear distributions.

Incomplete Cholesky decomposition for the kriging of large datasets,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.04.008,AUG 2013,20,3,"Kriging of very large spatial datasets is a challenging problem. The size n of the dataset causes problems in computing the kriging estimate: solving the kriging equations directly involves inverting an n x n covariance matrix. This operation requires O(n(3)) computations and a storage of O(n(2)). Under these circumstances, straightforward kriging of massive datasets is not possible. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature among which two main families exist: sparse approximation of the covariance function and low rank approaches. We propose here an approach that is built upon a low rank approximation of the covariance matrix obtained by incomplete Cholesky decomposition. This algorithm requires O(nk) storage and takes O(nk(2)) arithmetic operations, where k is the rank of the approximation, whose accuracy is controlled by a parameter. We detail the main properties of this method and explore its links with existing methods. Its benefits are illustrated on simple examples and compared to those of existing approaches. Finally, we show that this low rank representation is also suited for inverse conditioning of Gaussian random fields. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Optimized multi-phase sampling for soil remediation surveys,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.11.001,MAY 2013,39,7,"We develop an algorithm for optimizing the design of multi-phase soil remediation surveys. The locations of observations in later phases are selected to minimize the expected loss incurred from misclassification of the local contamination status of the soil. Unlike in existing multi-phase design methods, the location of multiple observations can be optimized simultaneously and the reduction in the expected loss can be forecast. Hence rational decisions can be made regarding the resources which should be allocated to further sampling. The geostatistical analysis uses a copula-based spatial model which can represent general types of variation including distributions which include extreme values. The algorithm is used to design a hypothetical second phase of a survey of soil lead contamination in Glebe, Sydney. Observations for this phase are generally dispersed on the boundaries between areas which, according to the first phase, either require or do not require remediation. The algorithm is initially used to make remediation decisions at the point scale, but we demonstrate how it can be used to inform over blocks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Hierarchical statistical modeling of big spatial datasets using the exponential family of distributions,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.02.002,MAY 2013,48,10,"Big spatial datasets are very common in scientific problems, such as those involving remote sensing of the earth by satellites, climate-model output, small-area samples from national surveys, and so forth. In this article, our interest lies primarily in very large, non-Gaussian datasets. We consider a hierarchical statistical model consisting of a conditional exponential-family model for the data and an underlying (hidden) geostatistical process for some transformation of the (conditional) mean of the data model. Within this hierarchical model, dimension reduction is achieved by modeling the geostatistical process as a linear combination of a fixed number of spatial basis functions, which results in substantial computational speed-ups. These models do not rely on specifying a spatial-weights matrix, and no assumptions of homogeneity, stationarity, or isotropy are made. Our approach to inference using these models is empirical-Bayesian in nature. We develop maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the unknown parameters using Laplace approximations in an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of the resulting empirical hierarchical model using a simulation study. We also apply our methodology to analyze a remote sensing dataset of aerosol optical depth.

Geographical-space deformation may be useful in situations where there is an indication that the assumption of stationarity of the variance is unrealistic. In this paper we present an algorithm, Spacebender, a variance equalising algorithm that can be used for generating the non-affine transform between geographic space and the transformed space. This transformed space, which takes care of the non-stationary spatial covariance structure in the geographic space, is the one in which regularly spaced points would be optimal for sampling. This transformed space is a kind of enviro-geographic space as opposed to a simple geographic one. Two examples are given; one is based on a digital elevation model, and the other used a data from a soil gamma radiometric potassium survey. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Objective Bayesian analysis of SAR models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.04.002,MAY 2013,26,1,"The simultaneously autoregressive model (abbreviated as SAR) has been extensively applied for lattice (regional summary) data. A Bayesian approach has been studied by De Oliveira and Song (2008), but they only considered two versions of Jeffreys priors, Jeffreys-rule and independence Jeffreys priors. They recommended the independence Jeffreys prior for a default prior. This prior is known to have the potential problem of posterior impropriety. In this paper, we consider the reference priors including the commonly used reference and ""exact'' reference priors for the SAR model. We show that common reference priors typically result in improper posterior distributions. Next, two ""exact'' reference priors are developed and are shown to yield proper posterior distributions. Frequentist properties of inferences based on two ""exact'' reference and Jeffreys-rule priors are studied by means of simulation. For illustrative purposes, we apply the method to SAT verbal scores across the US. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Spatio-temporal modeling for real-time ozone forecasting,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.04.003,MAY 2013,17,3,"Accurate assessment of exposure to ambient ozone concentrations is important for informing the public and pollution monitoring agencies about ozone levels that may lead to adverse health effects. A practical challenge facing the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is to provide real-time forecasting of current 8 h average ozone exposure over the entire conterminous United States. Such real-time forecasting is now provided as spatial forecast maps of current 8 h average ozone defined as the average of the previous four hours, current hour, and predictions for the next three hours. Current patterns are updated hourly throughout the day on the EPA-AIRNow web site.

Our contribution is to show how we can substantially improve upon current real-time forecasting systems. We introduce a down-scaler fusion model based on first differences of real- time monitoring data and numerical model output. The model has a flexible coefficient structure with an efficient computational strategy to fit model parameters. This strategy can be viewed as hybrid in that it blends offline model fitting with online predictions followed by fast spatial interpolation to produce the desired real- time forecast maps. Model validation for the eastern US shows consequential improvement of our fully inferential approach compared with the existing implementations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Disaggregation of spatial autoregressive processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.01.001,FEB 2013,43,6,"An aggregated Gaussian random field, possibly strong-dependent, is obtained from accumulation of i.i.d. short memory fields via an unknown mixing density phi which is to be estimated. The so-called disaggregation problem is considered, i.e. phi is estimated from a sample of the limiting aggregated field while samples of the elementary processes remain unobserved. Estimation of the density is via its expansion in terms of orthogonal Gegenbauer polynomials. After defining the estimators, their consistency and convergence rates are discussed. An example of application to beta-convergence in EU GDP per capita is discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Analysing the growth of OpenStreetMap networks,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2013.01.002,FEB 2013,37,21,In this article we analyse the growth of OpenStreetMap (OSM) representations for three street networks in Ireland. In each case we demonstrate the growth to be governed by two elementary spatial processes of densification and exploration which are responsible for increasing the local density of the network and expanding the network into new areas respectively. We also examine summary statistics describing each network topology and show these to be a consequence of the same processes. This represents the discovery of a novel link between different aspects of the growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In order to extend their field of application, Matern's original models are generalized here, both as point processes and particle processes. The thinning rule uses a distance-dependent probability function, which controls deletion of points close together. For this general setting, explicit formulas for first- and second-order characteristics can be given. Two examples from materials science illustrate the application of the models.

A review of spatial sampling,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.08.001,DEC 2012,68,106,"The main aim of spatial sampling is to collect samples in 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional space. It is typically used to estimate the total or mean for a parameter in an area, to optimize parameter estimations for unsampled locations, or to predict the location of a movable object. Some objectives are for populations, representing the ""here and now"", whereas other objectives concern superpopulations that generate the populations. Data to be collected are usually spatially autocorrelated and heterogeneous, whereas sampling is usually not repeatable. In various senses it is distinct from the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data from a population in conventional sampling. The uncertainty for spatial sample estimation propagates along a chain from spatial variation in the stochastic field to sample distribution and statistical tools used to obtain an estimate. This uncertainty is measured using either a design-based or model-based method. Both methods can be used in population and superpopulation studies. An unbiased estimate with the lowest variance is thus a common goal in spatial sampling and inference. Reaching this objective can be addressed by sample allocation in an area to obtain a restricted objective function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Kernel averaged predictors for spatio-temporal regression models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.05.001,DEC 2012,33,0,"In regression settings where covariates and responses are observed across space and time, a common goal is to quantify the effect of change in the covariates on the response while adequately accounting for the joint spatio-temporal structure in both. Customary modeling describes the relationship between a covariate and a response variable at a single spatio-temporal location. However, often it is anticipated that the relationship between the response and predictors may extend across space and time. In other words, the response at a given location and time may be affected by levels of predictors in spatio-temporal proximity. Here, a flexible modeling framework is proposed to capture such spatial and temporal lagged effects between a predictor and a response. Specifically, kernel functions are used to weight a spatio-temporal covariate surface in a regression model for the response. The kernels are assumed to be parametric and non-stationary with the data informing the parameter values of the kernel. The methodology is illustrated on simulated data as well as a physical data set of ozone concentrations to be explained by temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Fixed-count density estimation with virtual plots,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.09.001,DEC 2012,39,5,"It is demonstrated that the expected distance (r) from a random sample location to the kth nearest tree (r(k)) can be predicted with good precision via a proposed generic relationship between r(k), r(k-1), and r(k-2). The relationship affords m-step-ahead predictions which are exploited in a proposed fixed-count (plotless) density estimator. In applications the analyst must first determine the radius (r(virtual)) in a virtual fixed-area circular plot from the observed distances to the kth nearest point from n random sample locations. Then the number of point located inside each virtual plot is counted if r(k) >= r(virtual) or predicted via m-step ahead predictions if r(k) < r(virtual). Practical applications are demonstrated in simulated random fixed-count sampling with k = {3, 6} and sample sizes n = {15, 30} from 54 actual and 4 simulated point patterns. The median (absolute) relative bias was 3% and the maximum was 10%. Relative root mean-squared errors decreased with increasing k and n: for k = 6 and n = 30, the mean was 12%. It is concluded that the proposed density estimator is easy to implement. Its performance is on par with a newly proposed low-bias and efficient but complex composite fixed-count density estimator.

Level sets estimation and Vorob'ev expectation of random compact sets,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.10.001,DEC 2012,40,4,"The issue of a ""mean shape'' of a random set X often arises, in particular in image analysis and pattern detection. There is no canonical definition but one possible approach is the so-called Vorob'ev expectation E-V (X), which is closely linked to level or quantile sets. In this paper, we propose a consistent and ready to use estimator of E-V (X) built from independent copies of X with spatial discretisation. The control of discretisation errors is handled with a mild regularity assumption on the boundary of X. Several examples are developed and an application to cosmological data is presented.

Spatial statistics: A quantitative geographer's perspective,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.03.005,MAY 2012,66,4,"Historically, major contributions to popularizing spatial statistics derived from the pioneering work of Cliff and Ord. One outcome was the development of spatial econometrics. With the passing of time, this body of work merged with geostatistics to form the present day discipline of spatial statistics. The families of auto- and semivariogram models constitute a prominent component of the subject matter of contemporary spatial statistics. Its expansion from linear to generalized linear statistical models involves new methodologies, one of which is eigenvector spatial filtering. This paper presents evidence that this particular new methodology furnishes an effective dimension reduction substitution for the spatial lag matrix appearing in spatial auto-models.

Think continuous: Markovian Gaussian models in spatial statistics,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.02.003,MAY 2012,34,31,"Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) are frequently used as computationally efficient models in spatial statistics. Unfortunately, it has traditionally been difficult to link GMRFs with the more traditional Gaussian random field models, as the Markov property is difficult to deploy in continuous space. Following the pioneering work of Lindgren et al. (2011), we expound on the link between Markovian Gaussian random fields and GMRFs. In particular, we discuss the theoretical and practical aspects of fast computation with continuously specified Markovian Gaussian random fields, as well as the clear advantages they offer in terms of clear, parsimonious, and interpretable models of anisotropy and non-stationarity.

Hierarchical modeling for spatial data problems,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.02.005,MAY 2012,30,15,"This short paper is centered on hierarchical modeling for problems in spatial and spatio-temporal statistics. It draws its motivation from the interdisciplinary research work of the author in terms of applications in the environmental sciences-ecological processes, environmental exposure, and weather modeling. The paper briefly reviews hierarchical modeling specification, adopting a Bayesian perspective with full inference and associated uncertainty within the specification, while achieving exact inference to avoid what may be uncomfortable asymptotics. It focuses on point-referenced (geo-statistical) and point pattern spatial settings. It looks in some detail at problems involving data fusion, species distributions, and large spatial datasets. It also briefly describes four further examples arising from the author's recent research projects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Skew-normality for climatic data and dispersal models for plant epidemiology: When application fields drive spatial statistics,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.03.001,MAY 2012,56,5,"Developments in spatial statistics have a long standing tradition of being drawn out by specific applications. In this paper we illustrate this point by showing how research driven by two specific areas, namely the sensitivity of agriculture to climate change and plant epidemiology, has led to new developments in two branches of spatial statistics, respectively random field theory and spatio-temporal point processes. In a first part, it is shown how skew-normal distributions allow one to define skew-normal random fields and how these can be used to build a weather generator. In a second part, models for dispersal of propagules that can account for rough anisotropies and a model for group dispersal are presented. The distribution of the farthest dispersed point, a quantity of great interest for assessing expansion speed, is derived. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Some advances in Bayesian spatial prediction and sampling design,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.03.003,MAY 2012,64,7,"The goal of the present paper is to report on some recent advances, which we have made over the last five years, in spatial interpolation and sampling design in case of uncertainty about the parameters of common geostatistical models and non-Gaussianity of observations. In particular, we consider copula-based approaches to spatial interpolation when the observations are distinctly non-Gaussian and then report on criteria and methods for choosing default priors for Bayesian spatial interpolation and for choosing optimal designs based on (transformed) Gaussian kriging. For most of the interpolation and design methods presented in this paper we provide free source code in MATLAB/Octave language. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Towards soil geostatistics,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.02.001,MAY 2012,48,23,"In a brief survey of some issues in the application of geostatistics in soil science it is shown how the recasting of classical geostatistical methods in the linear mixed model (LMM) framework has allowed the more effective integration of soil knowledge (classifications, covariates) with statistical spatial prediction of soil properties. The LMM framework has also allowed the development of models in which the spatial covariance need not be assumed to be stationary. Such models are generally more plausible than stationary ones from a pedological perspective, and when applied to soil data they have been found to give prediction error variances that better describe the uncertainty of predictions at validation sites. Finally consideration is given to how scientific understanding of variable processes in the soil might be used to infer the likely statistical form of the observed soil variation.

"Spatial statistics, spatial regression, and graph theory in ecology",SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2012.02.004,MAY 2012,67,40,"A critical part of ecological studies is to quantify how landscape spatial heterogeneity affects species' distributions. With advancements in remote sensing technology and GIS, we now live in a data-rich era allowing us to investigate species-environment relationships in heterogeneous landscapes at multiple spatial scales. However, the degree and type of spatial heterogeneity changes depending on the spatial scale at which species-environment relationships are analysed. Here we present the current spatial analytic methods used in ecological studies to quantify ecological spatial heterogeneity. To determine the key spatial scales at which underlying ecological processes act upon species, we recommend use of spectral decomposition techniques such as wavelet analysis or Moran's eigenvector maps. Following this, a suite of spatial regression methods can be used to quantify the relative influence of environmental factors on species' distributions. Finally, spatial graph metrics can be employed to quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneity on landscape connectivity across or within species' ranges and can be used as additional predictors in spatial regression models. We emphasize how spatial statistics, spatial regression, and spatial graph theory can be used to provide insights into how land-scape spatial complexity influences species distributions and to better understand species response to global change.

We describe three approaches to quality assurance, which we term the crowd-sourcing, social, and geographic approaches respectively.

A hierarchical clustering method for multivariate geostatistical data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.07.003,NOV 2016,24,7,"Multivariate geostatistical data have become omnipresent in the geosciences and pose substantial analysis challenges. One of them is the grouping of data locations into spatially contiguous clusters so that data locations within the same cluster are more similar while clusters are different from each other. Spatially contiguous clusters can significantly improve the interpretation that turns the resulting clusters into meaningful geographical subregions. In this paper, we develop an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach that takes into account the spatial dependency between observations. It relies on a dissimilarity matrix built from a non-parametric kernel estimator of the multivariate spatial dependence structure of data. It integrates existing methods to find the optimal number of clusters and to evaluate the contribution of variables to the clustering. The capability of the proposed approach to provide spatially compact, connected and meaningful clusters is assessed using multivariate synthetic and real datasets. The proposed clustering method gives satisfactory results compared to other similar geostatistical clustering methods.

On the similarity analysis of spatial patterns,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.07.004,NOV 2016,23,1,"The evaluation of the spatial similarity of two observed point patterns is an important issue in spatial data quality assessment. In this work we propose a formal procedure that takes advantage of the joint use of space-filling curves and the multinomial model in order to establish a statistical test to compare spatial point patterns. In this mix, the space-filling curves offer a mechanism to order the 2D, 3D or n-D space and the multinomial distribution the statistical approach for testing homogeneity. A simulation method is proposed in order to analyze the applied performance of this idea. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Wavelet nonparametric estimation from strong spatial correlated high-dimensional data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.07.005,NOV 2016,35,0,"This paper addresses the problem of spatial prediction from strong spatial correlated high-dimensional data. Two approaches are considered: spatial wavelet kernel penalized nonparametric regression, and wavelet shrinkage. The best performance corresponds to spatial wavelet thresholding techniques applied to coarser scales, when slowly varying data displaying strong spatial correlations are analyzed. Our initial motivation relies on spatial estimation of annual mean ocean surface temperature maps to detect changes in ocean-surface temperatures, that could cause modifications in atmospheric circulation and precipitation. Specifically, we have analyzed daily ocean surface temperature curves from the Hawaii ocean stations, available at latitude-longitude interval [22.7, 22.8] x [-158.1,-157.94] during the period 2000-2007, from The World-Wide Ocean Optics Database (WOOD). Additionally, wavelet-based non-linear estimation procedures are compared with wavelet-based Gaussian linear model estimation methods, based on spatial autoregressive Hilbertian processes, and heavy tail covariance processes, solution to fractional pseudodifferential equations.

Grid-spacing and the quality of abundance maps for species that show spatial autocorrelation and zero-inflation,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.08.001,NOV 2016,34,0,"The effect of grid-spacing on the quality of species abundance maps is explored for species that show zero-inflation and spatial auto-correlation. Using a zero-inflated Poisson mixture model multiple fields of the prevalence parameter pi and the intensity parameter mu were simulated. A selected field was sampled by grid-sampling with 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 3200 m grid-spacing and used to predict at a fixed set of validation locations by simple kriging with an external drift. The external drift variables were silt, silt squared and altitude. The estimated sampling distribution of MSE against grid-spacing shows that beyond a spacing of 1600 m the mean of MSE increases at a much faster rate. Based on these findings the 1600m grid which consists of 446 locations for our study area of 2400 km(2) gives a compromise between sampling costs and prediction accuracy.

Multi-objective optimization of spatial sampling,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.09.001,NOV 2016,36,1,"The optimization of spatial sampling by simulated annealing has been demonstrated and applied for a range of objective functions. In practice more than one objective function may be important for sampling, and there may be complex trade-offs between them. In this paper it is shown how a multi-objective optimization algorithm can be applied to a spatial sampling problem. This generates a set of solutions which is non-dominated (no one solution does better than any other on all objective functions). These solutions represent different feasible trade-offs between the objective functions, and a subset might be practically acceptable. The algorithm is applied to a hypothetical example of sampling for a regional mean with the variance of the mean and the total distance travelled between sample points as the two objective functions. The solutions represent a transition of sample arrays from a loose grid to a tight loop. The potential to develop this approach and apply it to other spatial sampling problems is discussed.

It brings additional flexibility to modeling dependence structures among spatial extremes. The statistical properties of the Tukey max-stable process are demonstrated theoretically and numerically.

A spatial scan statistic for beta regression,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.09.003,NOV 2016,30,1,"Spatial Scan Statistics have been developed for geographical cluster detection in different types of models, for example, Bernoulli, multinomial, Poisson, Exponential, Weibull and Normal. However, some data are continuous in the interval (0, 1) such as rates, proportions and indices, or are limited in the interval (a, b), a < b. In this paper, we propose a spatial scan statistic for a Beta regression model. The test statistic is based on a likelihood ratio test and evaluated using Bootstrap p-value. The proposed method is illustrated using index of basic education and infant mortality in the Brazilian Amazon. The statistical power, sensitivity and positive predicted value of the test are examined through a simulation study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Inhomogeneous K-function for germ-grain models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.10.001,NOV 2016,46,0,"In this paper, we propose the definition of the inhomogeneous K-function for germ-grain models, based on the reduced second order measure for general random sets. In general, grains in a germ-grain model can overlap, and the inhomogeneous K-function defined for point processes cannot be directly extended. This function can be used for analyzing the interactions between grains and distinguishing between realizations of different germ-grain models. Its effectiveness is tested by means of a simulation study. Finally, as an illustration, it is applied to a sample of images of peripheral blood smears obtained from patients with Sickle Cell Disease, in order to decide whether the sample belongs to the thin, thick or morphological zone.

Spatio-temporal point process statistics: A review,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.10.002,NOV 2016,124,4,"Spatio-temporal point process data have been analysed quite a bit in specialised fields, with the aim of better understanding the inherent mechanisms that govern the temporal evolution of events placed in a planar region. In particular, in the last decade there has been an acceleration of methodological developments, accompanied by a broad collection of applications as spatiotemporally indexed data have become more widely available in many scientific fields.

We present a self-contained review describing statistical models and methods that can be used to analyse patterns of points in space and time when the questions of scientific interest concern both their spatial and their temporal behaviour. We revisit moment characteristics that define summary statistics, as well as conditional intensities which uniquely characterise certain spatiotemporal point processes. We make use of these concepts to describe models and associated methods of inference for spatiotemporal point process data.

Three new motivating real-data examples are described and analysed throughout the paper to illustrate the most relevant techniques, discussing the pros and cons of the different considered approaches.

The impact of averaging methods on the trend analysis of the Antarctic sea ice extent and perimeter,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.04.002,NOV 2016,24,0,"To estimate the long-term trends in changes for the Antarctic sea ice, daily extents of sea ice were integrated to monthly averages. Different integration methods, however, result in monthly ice extents with inconsistent boundaries that may have further impact on the estimated trend rates. We used random sets to model the sea ice extent and we compared five averaging methods to derive the monthly expectation from a set of daily ice extents and examined their differences in the trend analysis. The Antarctic sea ice extent exhibited consistent statistically significant upward trends for the period November 1978-December 2014 at a rate of approximately 24 +/- 2.3 x 10(3) km(2)yr(-1). The trends in the sea ice perimeter, however, do not agree and its estimation is more sensitive to the averaging methods. Large gaps among monthly sea ice boundaries occurred in the regions where sea ice retreated or expanded dramatically in a single month, especially in the Weddell Sea and the Indian Ocean during the month of December. The study showed that more attention should be given to these regions during periods that the daily sea ice experiences more notable dynamics. We finally commented that the median set can serve as a widely applicable method for both ice extent and perimeter and that the Vorob'ev expectation is appropriate only for the extent estimation.

Functional summary statistics for point processes on the sphere with an application to determinantal point processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.06.004,NOV 2016,34,2,"We study point processes on Sd, the d-dimensional unit sphere S-d, considering both the isotropic and the anisotropic case, and focusing mostly on the spherical case d = 2. The first part studies reduced Palm distributions and functional summary statistics, including nearest neighbour functions, empty space functions, and Ripley's and inhomogeneous K-functions. The second part partly discusses the appealing properties of determinantal point process (DPP) models on the sphere and partly considers the application of functional summary statistics to DPPs. In fact DPPs exhibit repulsiveness, but we also use them together with certain dependent thinnings when constructing point process models on the sphere with aggregation on the large scale and regularity on the small scale. We conclude with a discussion on future work on statistics for spatial point processes on the sphere. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The consistency and asymptotic normality of estimators are obtained under mild assumptions on the determinantal point process. We illustrate the efficiency of the procedures in a simulation study.

The rank and directional quantile envelope tests are discussed and practical rules for their use are provided. These tests are global envelope tests with an appropriate type I error probability. Two novel examples are given on their usage. First, in addition to the test based on a classical one-dimensional summary function, the goodness-of-fit of a point process model is evaluated by means of the test based on a higher dimensional functional statistic, namely a two-dimensional smoothed residual field. Second, a goodness-of-fit test of a geostatistical model is performed based on two-dimensional raw residuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A spectral mean for random closed curves,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.02.002,NOV 2016,25,0,We propose a spectral mean for closed sets described by sample points on their boundaries subject to mis-alignment and noise. We derive maximum likelihood estimators for the model and noise parameters in the Fourier domain. We estimate the unknown mean boundary curve by back-transformation and derive the distribution of the integrated squared error. Mis-alignment is dealt with by means of a shifted parametric diffeomorphism. The method is illustrated on simulated data and applied to photographs of Lake Tana taken by astronauts during a Shuttle mission. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial statistics and Gaussian processes: A beautiful marriage,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.03.006,NOV 2016,56,6,"Spatial analysis has grown at a remarkable rate over the past two decades. Fueled by sophisticated GIS software and inexpensive and fast computation, collection of data with spatially referenced information has increased. Recognizing that such information can improve data analysis has led to an explosion of modeling and model fitting.

The contribution of this paper is to illustrate how Gaussian processes have emerged as, arguably, the most valuable tool in the toolkit for geostatistical modeling. Apart from the simplest versions, geostatistical modeling can be viewed as a hierarchical specification with Gaussian processes introduced appropriately at different levels of the specification. This naturally leads to adopting a Bayesian framework for inference and suitable Gibbs sampling/Markov chain Monte Carlo for model fitting.

Here, we review twenty years of modeling work spanning multivariate spatial analysis, gradient analysis, Bayesian nonparametric spatial ideas, directional data, extremes, data fusion, and large spatial and spatio-temporal datasets. We demonstrate that Gaussian processes are the key ingredients in all of this work. Most of the content is focused on modeling with examples being limited due to length constraints for the article. Altogether, we are able to conclude that spatial statistics and Gaussian processes do, indeed, make a beautiful marriage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Multi-level restricted maximum likelihood covariance estimation and kriging for large non-gridded spatial datasets,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.10.006,NOV 2016,22,2,"We develop a multi-level restricted Gaussian maximum likelihood method for estimating the covariance function parameters and computing the best unbiased predictor. Our approach produces a new set of multi-level contrasts where the deterministic parameters of the model are filtered out thus enabling the estimation of the covariance parameters to be decoupled from the deterministic component. Moreover, the multi-level covariance matrix of the contrasts exhibits fast decay that is dependent on the smoothness of the covariance function. Due to the fast decay of the multi-level covariance matrix coefficients only a small set is computed with a level dependent criterion. We demonstrate our approach on problems of up to 512,000 observations with a Matern covariance function and highly irregular placements of the observations. In addition, these problems are numerically unstable and hard to solve with traditional methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A flexible class of non-separable cross-covariance functions for multivariate space-time data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.02.004,NOV 2016,30,7,"Multivariate space-time data are increasingly available in various scientific disciplines. When analyzing these data, one of the key issues is to describe the multivariate space-time dependences. Under the Gaussian framework, one needs to propose relevant models for multivariate space-time covariance functions, i.e. matrix-valued mappings with the additional requirement of non-negative definiteness. We propose a flexible parametric class of cross-covariance functions for multivariate space-time Gaussian random fields. Space-time components belong to the (univariate) Gneiting class of space-time covariance functions, with Matern or Cauchy covariance functions in the spatial margins. The smoothness and scale parameters can be different for each variable. We provide sufficient conditions for positive definiteness. A simulation study shows that the parameters of this model can be efficiently estimated using weighted pairwise likelihood, which belongs to the class of composite likelihood methods. We then illustrate the model on a French dataset of weather variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Some anisotropy indices for the characterization of Brownian textures and their application to breast images,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.02.001,NOV 2016,43,1,"In this paper, we focus on the analysis of image textures modeled by anisotropic fractional Brownian fields. We propose some anisotropy indices intended to characterize the anisotropy of these textures. The construction of these indices relies upon the use of multi-oriented quadratic variations. It is based on directional quantities appearing in their asymptotic expectation. We show that anisotropy indices are invariant to some image transforms, and estimable from observed data. Eventually, we use anisotropy indices in combination with a measure of texture roughness to detect lesions in mammograms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Spatially adaptive covariance tapering,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.03.003,NOV 2016,23,2,"Covariance tapering is a popular approach for reducing the computational cost of spatial prediction and parameter estimation for Gaussian process models. However, tapering can have poor performance when the process is sampled at spatially irregular locations or when non-stationary covariance models are used. This work introduces an adaptive tapering method in order to improve the performance of tapering in these problematic cases. This is achieved by introducing a computationally convenient class of compactly supported non-stationary covariance functions, combined with a new method for choosing spatially varying taper ranges. Numerical experiments are used to show that the performance of both kriging prediction and parameter estimation can be improved by allowing for spatially varying taper ranges. However, although adaptive tapering outperforms regular tapering, simply dividing the data into blocks and ignoring the dependence between the blocks is often a better method for parameter estimation.

Assessing the spatio-temporal structure of annual and seasonal surface temperature for CMIP5 and reanalysis,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.03.004,NOV 2016,47,1,"Comparison of climate models in an ensemble with reanalysis data is crucial for the climate model user community, as detection of discrepancies can convey information to improve models. Current comparison methodologies focus on statistical space-time properties of the climatological mean, and allow for a sensible model comparison only if the forcing scenarios are identical or very similar. We analyze the annual and seasonal surface temperature of the CMIP5 ensemble and three reanalysis data products, and propose a scenario-independent, statistical-based classification relying on the space-time structure of the variability around the climatological mean. This approach exploits the gridded geometry of the atmospheric component of a global climate model, complements traditional criteria based on characteristics of the climatological trend and allows for a novel measure of similarity. For models with a similar physical scheme, we found a high degree of similarity for the same grid resolution, and a moderate similarity if the resolution is different. Further, we found that a considerable difference among reanalysis data products, thus indicating that different assimilation algorithms can significantly impact the space-time structure of the variability around the mean climate.

Non-Gaussian bivariate modelling with application to atmospheric trace-gas inversion,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.06.005,NOV 2016,63,2,"Atmospheric trace-gas inversion is the procedure by which the sources and sinks of a trace gas are identified from observations of its mole fraction at isolated locations in space and time. This is inherently a spatio-temporal bivariate inversion problem, since the mole-fraction field evolves in space and time and the flux is also spatio-temporally distributed. Further, the bivariate model is likely to be non-Gaussian since the flux field is rarely Gaussian. Here, we use conditioning to construct a non-Gaussian bivariate model, and we describe some of its properties through auto-and cross-cumulant functions. A bivariate non-Gaussian, specifically trans-Gaussian, model is then achieved through the use of Box-Cox transformations, and we facilitate Bayesian inference by approximating the likelihood in a hierarchical framework. Trace-gas inversion, especially at high spatial resolution, is frequently highly sensitive to prior specification. Therefore, unlike conventional approaches, we assimilate trace-gas inventory information with the observational data at the parameter layer, thus shifting prior sensitivity from the inventory itself to its spatial characteristics (e.g., its spatial length scale).

A spatio-temporal comparison of avian migration phenology using Citizen Science data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.06.006,NOV 2016,42,1,"The effects of climate change have wide-ranging impacts on wildlife species and recent studies indicate that birds' spring arrival dates are advancing in response to changes in global climates. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal approach for comparing avian first arrival data for multiple species. As an example, we analyze spring arrival data for two long-distance migrants (Ruby-throated Hummingbird Archilochus colubris; and Purple Martin Progne subis) in eastern North America from 2001-2010 using Citizen Science data. The proposed approach provides researchers with a tool to compare mean arrival dates while accounting for spatial and temporal variability. Our results show that on average, Purple Martins arrive 29.95 to 31.84 days earlier than Ruby-throated Hummingbirds, but after accounting for this overall difference, spatial nuances exist whereby martins arrive earlier in the southern United States and migrate northward at a slower rate than hummingbirds. Differences were also noted in how climate and weather variables such as the North Atlantic Oscillation index, winter temperature, winter-spring precipitation, sampling effort, and altitude impacted migration dates. Our method may easily be generalized to analyze a broad range of temporal and spatial Citizen Scientists data to help better understand the ecological impacts of climate change.

Spatial scale in land use models: Application to the Teruti-Lucas survey,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.06.009,NOV 2016,22,1,"We consider the problem of land use prediction at different spatial scales using point level data such as the Teruti-Lucas (T-L here-after(1)) survey and some explanatory variables. We analyze the components of the prediction error using a synthetic data set constructed from the Teruti-Lucas points in the Midi-Pyrenes region and a five categories land use classification. The study first shows that the number of points in the Teruti-Lucas survey is quite enough for estimating the probabilities of each land use category with a good quality. Furthermore it reveals that, contrary to usual practice, when the objective is to predict land use at aggregated levels, land use probabilities should be estimated at more locations where explanatory variables are available rather than restricting to the initial Teruti-Lucas locations. Indeed this strategy borrows strength from the knowledge of the explanatory variables which may be heterogeneous. Finally, guidelines for constructing the grid of locations for estimation are given from the analysis of the heterogeneity of each explanatory variable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A spatial-temporal double-hurdle model for extremely over-dispersed avian count data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.05.001,NOV 2016,36,1,"Several wind energy facilities are currently being planned for offshore Atlantic waters of the United States. However, relatively little is known about the distribution, abundance and spatio-temporal variability of marine birds in their offshore habitats and it is becoming increasingly necessary to accurately characterize these demographic parameters before assessing the influence of factors such as offshore energy development on populations. Thus, we incorporate a multi-scale approach to develop models for the space-time distribution and abundance of marine birds to identify potential high-use areas in need of further study. With data taken from past and ongoing survey efforts, we provide relative abundance and density estimates for marine birds over a wide geographical area during multiple years. Due to the excessive amount of zeros as well as extremely large counts exhibited in the data, a double-hurdle model is formulated that includes a negative binomial and a generalized Pareto distribution mixture. Spatial heterogeneity is modeled using a conditional auto-regressive (CAR) prior, and a Fourier basis was used for seasonal variation. We demonstrate our model by creating probability maps that show areas of high-abundance and aggregation for twenty-four species of marine bird. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A survey on ecological regression for health hazard associated with air pollution,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.05.003,NOV 2016,191,1,"In the last 30 years, a large number of studies have provided substantial statistical evidence of the adverse health effects associated with air pollution. Statistical literature is very rich and includes a plethora of models to manage different types of spatial data. This paper starts with a thorough discussion on the spatial nature of the available data on health and air pollution. Health data are usually provided by Health Authorities as mortality and morbidity counts at a small area level. Thus we mainly focus on reviewing and discussing the spatial and spatio-temporal regression models proposed for disease count data on irregular lattices. In general, measuring the effect of exposure on health outcomes is an extremely hard task, and to obtain reliable estimates of the exposure effect and associated uncertainty one needs to build models that account for the residual variability not captured by the exposure-response relationship. In this context, Bayesian hierarchical models including spatial random effects play a prominent role: we consider both univariate and multivariate models and discuss some extensions to the spatio-temporal setting. Since model estimation can be prohibitive, practitioners are provided with a list of available software for Bayesian inference that avoids the need for complicated coding. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Emerging patterns in multi-sourced data modeling uncertainty,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.05.005,NOV 2016,47,2,"The abundance of spatial and space-time data in many research fields has led to an increasing interest in the analytics of spatial data information. This development has renewed the attention to predictive spatial methodologies and advancing geostatistical tools. In this context, the present work reviews a series of cross-discipline studies that utilize multiple monitoring sources, and promote applied approaches in spatial and spatiotemporal modeling to improve our understanding of uncertainty. As multisourced information gives birth to new aspects of uncertainty, we explore emerging patterns in dealing with uncertainty in sources across structured, unstructured, and incomplete spatial data. We also illustrate how additional forms of information, such as secondary data and physical models, can further support and benefit research in the characterization and modeling of natural attributes.

On the (virtual) getting of wisdom: Immersive 3D interfaces for eliciting spatial information from experts,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.07.001,NOV 2016,47,2,"Expert information is a valuable resource in developing robust spatial models to improve understanding and prediction of systems in health, environment, business and society. However, getting experts to reliably activate and encode what they know has proven to be an elusive goal. A root cause of this elusiveness is the fact that expert knowledge is largely tacit, i.e., experts struggle to describe what they know. The imperative to address this goal is increasing. There is a constant need for better models of expert knowledge in organizations, much observational data is sparse and inadequate for spatial modelling, and many domains have knowledgeable workers leaving in numbers. Interviews are often used for eliciting expert knowledge, due to their ease of implementation. However, there is evidence that a lack of appropriate stimuli reduces the quality of knowledge elicited. This paper explores the use of immersive 3D virtual worlds for improved knowledge elicitation, due to their priming effects on memory recall. A case study on habitat prediction for a rock wallaby species is presented, in which the new approach is trialled. This paper is one of the first that aims to combine new virtual spatial technology with expert elicitation for improved spatial statistical modelling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Deducing self-interaction in eye movement data using sequential spatial point processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.03.005,AUG 2016,26,1,"Eye movement data are outputs of an analyser tracking the gaze when a person is inspecting a scene. These kind of data are of increasing importance in scientific research as well as in applications, e.g. in marketing and human-computer interface design. Thus the new areas of application call for advanced analysis tools. Our research objective is to suggest statistical modelling of eye movement sequences using sequential spatial point processes, which decomposes the variation in data into structural components having interpretation.

We consider three elements of an eye movement sequence: heterogeneity of the target space, contextuality between subsequent movements, and time-dependent behaviour describing self-interaction. We propose two model constructions. One is based on the history-dependent rejection of transitions in a random walk and the other makes use of a history-adapted kernel function penalized by user-defined geometric model characteristics. Both models are inhomogeneous self-interacting random walks. Statistical inference based on the likelihood is suggested, some experiments are carried out, and the models are used for determining the uncertainty of important data summaries for eye movement data.

Hierarchical copula regression models for areal data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.04.006,AUG 2016,44,0,"Regression analysis for spatially aggregated data is common in a number of fields, including public health, ecology, and econometrics. Often, the goal of such an analysis is to quantify the relationship between an outcome of interest and one or more covariates. The mixed model with proper conditional autoregressive (CAR) spatial random effects is commonly used to model such data but suffers serious drawbacks. First, an analyst must interpret covariate effects conditionally although marginal effects may be of interest. Second, the dependence parameter of the proper CAR model has an intuitive conditional interpretation, but the parameter's marginal interpretation is complicated and counter-intuitive; specifically, spatial units with a similar number of neighbors have different marginal correlations. To overcome these two drawbacks, we propose a copula-based hierarchical model with covariance selection. Our approach allows for unbiased estimation of marginal parameters and thus an intuitive marginal interpretation. The covariance-selection copula's single dependence parameter is the first-order correlation. This provides a dependence structure having intuitive conditional and marginal interpretations. We develop a computational framework that permits efficient frequentist inference for our model, even for large datasets. We evaluate the small- and large-sample performance of our method under simulated conditions, and apply our procedure to a widely studied Slovenia stomach cancer dataset. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Parameter-estimation methods for symmetric stable distributions: Application to small samples of spatial fluctuations of rainfall,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.04.001,AUG 2016,43,2,"The estimation of parameters of stable distributions is hampered by the lack of closed-form expressions for the density and distribution functions. Moreover, the accuracy of estimation methods is affected noticeably by small samples that fail to provide sufficiently descriptive information about the empirical distribution. This study reviewed the methods most commonly used and examined the possibility of improving the estimation of parameters of symmetric stable distributions using mathematical properties derived from the absolute value of symmetric stable variables. On one hand, considering the absolute value might be beneficial to the adjustment of small samples because insufficient data in one tail of the empirical distribution could be complemented with data from the other. Thus, the performance of techniques that rely on distribution quantiles might be improved. On the other hand, the evaluation of the distribution function at fractional absolute moments was found to be a good estimator of the characteristic exponent of stable distributions. This technique is faster than regression-type methods and returns remarkably similar results. The performances of these parameter-estimation methods were evaluated by analyzing the results of an application to small samples from spatial fluctuations of rainfall in which extreme variations are frequently found.

A new isotropic locality improved kernel for pattern classifications in remote sensing imagery,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.04.003,AUG 2016,26,0,"Kernel based learning algorithms are sensitive to the choice of appropriate kernel function and parameter setting. Classification accuracies yielded by the kernel based classifiers may show variation depending on the choice of the kernel and its associated parameters. Suggesting an efficient kernel function and effective setting of kernel parameters are thus important problems for kernel based classifiers. In this article, we have investigated the performance of the existing kernel functions with our proposed kernel using support vector machines (SVMs). Linear, polynomial, sigmoid, radial basis function (RBF) and the proposed kernel are applied for the classification of the ten real life data sets having features and classes ranging from 4 to 19 and 2 to 5 respectively. The performance of different kernels is also demonstrated on two multispectral and two hyperspectral images. Experimental results on these data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed kernel on several data distributions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Utilizing spatial association analysis to determine the number of multiple grids for multiple-point statistics,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.06.003,AUG 2016,42,0,"Scale selection is a fundamental issue of spatial analysis. Based on spatial association analysis, this paper proposes a quantitative method for estimating the scale, which is represented using the minimal number of multiple grids in a single normal equation simulation. First, the largest scale structural information that a data template can consider for the finest grid is computed using the distance between the central cell and the border of the data template. The maximum distance at which cells are associated with each other in the training image is then analyzed using join count statistics. Finally, the minimal number of multiple grids is estimated based on the criterion that the data template used on the largest grid should account for the maximum distance between associated cells. The proposed method is validated using two- and three-dimensional experiments. The results show that increasing the number of multiple grids does not significantly improve the simulation quality when the number of multiple grids used is larger than that estimated. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the proposed method adapts to the configuration of the data template, the geometric structure of the target surface objects, and a rescaled training image if it adequately represents the large-scale structural information of the target surface objects.

A dynamic model for age-specific fertility rates in Italy,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.05.002,AUG 2016,47,0,"Fertility evolution in Italy has shown a deep drop in 1995, and up to now the fertility rate is considered among the lowest in the world. The empirical distribution of the age-specific fertility rates is characterized by a decreasing tendency of the maximum fertility rate and a simultaneous increase of the corresponding mother's age. This tendency has been stimulating recent contributions in modelling and forecasting.

The aim of this paper is to propose a dynamic model for describing and predicting the evolution of the Italian age-specific fertility rates over time. In particular, a well-documented model, such as a Gamma function, slightly modified in order to include time-varying stochastic parameters, is used to describe the systematic and macroscopic variations of the age-specific fertility rates over time, while a nonparametric geostatistical model is applied to describe the correlated residuals at microscopic level. Finally, predictions for the variable under study are provided and main empirical evidences of the temporal evolution for different mother's ages are discussed.

Likelihood analysis for a class of spatial geostatistical compositional models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.06.008,AUG 2016,35,0,"We propose a model-based geostatistical approach to deal with regionalized compositions. We combine the additive-log-ratio transformation with multivariate geostatistical models whose covariance matrix is adapted to take into account the correlation induced by the compositional structure. Such specification allows the usage of standard likelihood methods for parameters estimation. For spatial prediction we combined a back-transformation with the Gauss-Hermite method to approximate the conditional expectation of the compositions. We analyse particle size fractions of the top layer of a soil for agronomic purposes which are typically expressed as proportions of sand, clay and silt. Additionally a simulation study assesses the small sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimator. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A non-stationary spatial approach to disjunctive kriging in reserve estimation,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.06.001,AUG 2016,60,1,"In the spatial estimation of recoverable reserves of an ore deposit, disjunctive kriging is used to calculate the panel-wise ore and metal tonnage by estimating the conditional probability of block grades. In real mining practice, it is necessary to consider a change of support model along with disjunctive kriging to estimate functions of the variables with larger support than samples. However, disjunctive kriging is based on the assumption of strict stationarity. But, in reality, stationary model often falls short in evaluating complex geological structure. It is obvious that the standard stationary technique neglects the apparent changes in the local mean and variances and hence produces unreliable outcomes. Moreover, important geological feature such as spatial continuity of the deposit does not get replicated by the conventional stationary model. This paper deals with the formalism of a non-stationary disjunctive kriging model allowing change of support model and its practical application in estimating local recoverable reserves of ore deposit. A thorough investigation through simulation experiment is carried out to critically judge the performance of the proposed model followed by a real life application to a copper deposit. The relevance of the developed model is established as it is validated by real production data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A probabilistic predictive Bayesian approach for determining the representativeness of health and demographic surveillance networks,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.05.006,AUG 2016,38,2,"Health and demographic surveillance systems, formed into networks of sites, are increasingly being established to circumvent unreliable national civil registration systems for estimates of mortality and its determinants in low income countries. Health outcomes, as measured by morbidity and mortality, generally correlate strongly with socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. Therefore, to enable comparison between sites, understand which sites can be grouped and where additional sites would aid understanding of rates and determinants, determining the environmental and socioeconomic representativeness of networks becomes important. This paper proposes a full Bayesian methodology for assessing current representativeness and consequently, identification of future sites, focusing on the INDEPTH network in sub-Saharan Africa as an example. Using socioeconomic and environmental data from the current network of 39 sites, we develop a multi-dimensional finite Gaussian mixture model for clustering the existing sites. Using the fitted model we obtain the posterior predictive probability distribution for cluster membership of each 1 x 1 km grid cell in Africa. The maximum of the posterior predictive probability distribution for each grid cell is proposed as the criterion for representativeness of the network for that particular grid cell. We demonstrate the conceptual superiority and practical appeal of the proposed Bayesian probabilistic method over previously applied deterministic clustering methods. As an example of the potential utility and application of the method, we also suggest optimal site selection methods for possible additions to the network. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Penalized composite link models for aggregated spatial count data: A mixed model approach,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.06.007,AUG 2016,51,0,"Mortality data provide valuable information for the study of the spatial distribution of mortality risk, in disciplines such as spatial epidemiology and public health. However, they are frequently available in an aggregated form over irregular geographical units, hindering the visualization of the underlying mortality risk. Also, it can be of interest to obtain mortality risk estimates on a finer spatial resolution, such that they can be linked to potential risk factors that are usually measured in a different spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose the use of the penalized composite link model and its mixed model representation. This model considers the nature of mortality rates by incorporating the population size at the finest resolution, and allows the creation of mortality maps at a finer scale, thus reducing the visual bias resulting from the spatial aggregation within original units. Wealso extend the model by considering individual random effects at the aggregated scale, in order to take into account the overdispersion. We illustrate our novel proposal using two datasets: female deaths by lung cancer in Indiana, USA, and male lip cancer incidence in Scotland counties. We also compare the performance of our proposal with the area-to-point Poisson kriging approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Statistical analysis of spatially homogeneous dynamic agent-based processes using functional time series analysis,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.06.002,AUG 2016,61,0,"Dynamic systems consisting of multiple interacting autonomous individuals are of particular interest in a number of scientific fields, including ecology, biology, and swarm robotics. Such systems are commonly referred to as agent-based processes. Detection and characterisation of agent-agent interactions is an important step in the analysis of agent-based processes, however existing statistical methods are relatively limited. This paper presents a novel framework for investigating spatial interactions between agents combining techniques from spatial statistics and functional time series analysis. Assuming second order spatial equilibrium of the agent-based process, we develop a test for identifying the specific nature of interactions between agents. We also consider methodology for validating the assumption of spatial equilibrium for a given realisation of the agent-based process. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulation studies and an application to experimental data obtained by observing a species of flightless locust.

Modeling asymptotically independent spatial extremes based on Laplace random fields,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.01.001,MAY 2016,45,4,"Wetackle the modeling of threshold exceedances in asymptotically independent stochastic processes by constructions based on Laplace random fields. Defined as mixtures of Gaussian random fields with an exponential variable embedded for the variance, these processes possess useful asymptotic properties while remaining statistically convenient. Univariate Laplace distribution tails are part of the limiting generalized Pareto distributions for threshold exceedances. After normalizing marginal distributions in data, a standard Laplace field can be used to capture spatial dependence among extremes. Asymptotic properties of Laplace fields are explored and compared to the classical framework of asymptotic dependence. Multivariate joint tail decay rates are slower than for Gaussian fields with the same covariance structure; hence they provide more conservative estimates of very extreme joint risks while maintaining asymptotic independence. Statistical inference is illustrated on extreme wind gusts in the Netherlands where a comparison to the Gaussian dependence model shows a better goodness-of-fit. In this application we fit the well-adapted Weibull distribution, closely related to the Laplace distribution, as univariate tail model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Half spectral composite likelihood approach for estimating spatial-temporal covariance functions,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.01.003,MAY 2016,37,1,In this paper we propose a method called half spectral composite likelihood for the estimation of spatial-temporal covariance functions which involves a spectral approach in time and a covariance function in space. It facilitates the analysis of spectral density of all possible pairwise contrasts at different spatial sites. The proposed approach requires no matrix inversions and the estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal under increasing domain asymptotic in a fashion similar to Bevilacqua et al. (2012). A simulation study is carried out to assess the performance of the proposed estimation method from statistical and computational viewpoint with respect to difference composite likelihood. The half spectral composite likelihood estimates show better performance with respect to the difference composite likelihood. A real example is given using the Irish wind speed data.

A generalized convolution model and estimation for non-stationary random functions,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.01.002,MAY 2016,32,6,"In this paper, a new model for second order non-stationary random functions as a convolution of an orthogonal random measure with a spatially varying random weighting function is introduced. The proposed model is a generalization of the classical convolution model where a non-random weighting function is considered. For a suitable choice of the random weighting functions family, this model allows to easily retrieve classes of closed-form non-stationary covariance functions with locally varying geometric anisotropy existing in the literature. This offers a clarification of the link between these latter and a convolution representation, thereby allowing a better understanding and interpretation of their parameters. Under a single realization and a local stationarity framework, a parameter estimation procedure of these classes of explicit non-stationary covariance functions is developed. From a local stationary variogram kernel estimator, a weighted local least-squares method in combination with a kernel smoothing method is used to estimate efficiently the parameters. The proposed estimation method is applied on soil and rainfall datasets. It emerges that this non-stationary method outperforms the traditional stationary method, according to several criteria. Beyond the spatial predictions, we also show how conditional simulations can be carried out in this non-stationary framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Conditioning multiple-point statistics simulations to block data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.02.005,MAY 2016,31,6,"Multiple-points statistics (MPS) allows to generate random fields reproducing spatial statistics derived from a training image. MPS methods consist in borrowing patterns from the training set. Therefore, the simulation domain is assumed to be at the same resolution as the conceptual model, although geometrical deformations can be handled by such techniques. Whereas punctual conditioning data corresponding to the scale of the grid node can be easily integrated, accounting for data available at larger scales is challenging. In this paper, we propose an extension of MPS able to deal with block data, i.e. target mean values over subsets of the simulation domain. Our extension is based on the direct sampling algorithm and consists to add a criterion for the acceptance of the candidate node scanned in the training image to constrain the simulation to block data. Likelihood ratios are used to compare the averages of the simulated variable taken on the informed nodes in the blocks and the target mean values. Moreover, the block data may overlap and their support can be of any shape and size. Illustrative examples show the potential of the presented algorithm for practical applications.

Bayesian spatial binary classification,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.01.004,MAY 2016,26,2,"In analyses of spatially-referenced data, researchers often have one of two goals: to quantify relationships between a response variable and covariates while accounting for residual spatial dependence or to predict the value of a response variable at unobserved locations. In this second case, when the response variable is categorical, prediction can be viewed as a classification problem. Many classification methods either ignore response-variable/covariate relationships and rely only on spatially proximate observations for classification, or they ignore spatial dependence and use only the covariates for classification. The Bayesian spatial generalized linear (mixed) model offers a tool to accommodate both spatial and covariate sources of information in classification problems. In this paper, we formally define spatial classification rules based on these models. We also take a close look at two of these models that have been proposed in the literature, namely the probit versions of the spatial generalized linear model (SGLM) and the Bayesian spatial generalized linear mixed model (SGLMM). We describe the implications of the seemingly slight differences between these models for spatial classification and explore the issue of robustness to model misspecification through a simulation study. We also provide an overview of alternatives to the SGLM/SGLMM-based classifiers and illustrate the various methods using satellite-derived land cover data from Southeast Asia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

High-level hyperspectral image classification based on spectro-spatial dimensionality reduction,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.02.003,MAY 2016,24,6,"Spectro-spatial dimensionality reduction in HyperSpectral Images (HSI) classification is a challenging task due to the problem of curse dimensionality, i.e. the high number of spectral bands and the heterogeneity of data. In this context, many dimensionality reduction methods have been developed to overcome the high correlation between bands and the redundancy of information in order to improve the classification accuracy. Most of these methods represent the original HSI as a set of vectors. Therefore, they only exploit spectral properties, neglecting the spatial information, i.e. the spatial rearrangement is lost. To jointly take advantage of spatial and spectral information, HSI has been recently represented as a tensor. In order to preserve the spatial and spectral information, we develop a hybrid method using both the Tensor Locality Preserving Projections method (TLPP) projecting the original data into a lower subspace and the Constrained Band Selection method (CBS) to select the relevant bands. These two methods will be jointly used to get high-level quality classification. Moreover, since the two obtained classifications are uncertain and imprecise, we propose to fuse them using the Dempster-Shafer's Theory (DST) to obtain an accurate classification preserving the spectro-spatial information. The proposed approach has been applied on real HSI showing its efficiency compared with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Testing the random field model hypothesis for random marked closed sets,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.03.001,MAY 2016,24,1,"When developing statistical models, it is of fundamental importance to decide if the various components are independent of one another, preferably using a formal statistical test. Non-parametric versions of such tests are particularly useful, as they do not require extensive a priori knowledge about the underlying models. In this paper, we develop such tests for random marked closed sets, which have many applications in spatial statistics. More precisely, we investigate two approaches to testing if the marks are independent of the closed set. Both approaches are based on second-order characteristics of random marked closed sets. The first approach uses a global rank envelope test based on the mark-weighted K-function. The second approach uses an asymptotic test developed for marked point processes. We carry out extensive simulation studies to assess the performance of these tests, demonstrating that the global rank envelope test is a better choice. Finally, we apply this test to two real world data sets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Application of optimal data-based binning method to spatial analysis of ecological datasets,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.02.006,MAY 2016,28,3,"Investigation of highly structured datasets to unveil statistical regularities is of major importance in complex system research. The first step is to choose the scale at which to observe the process, the most informative scale being the one that includes the important features while disregarding noisy details in the data. In the investigation of spatial patterns, the optimal scale defines the optimal bin size of the histogram in which to visualize the empirical density of the pattern. In this paper we investigate a method proposed recently by K.H. Knuth to find the optimal bin size of an histogram as a tool for statistical analysis of spatial point processes. We test it through numerical simulations on various spatial processes which are of interest in ecology. We show that Knuth optimal bin size rule reducing noisy fluctuations performs better than standard kernel methods to infer the intensity of the underlying process. Moreover it can be used to highlight relevant spatial characteristics of the underlying distribution such as space anisotropy and clusterization. We apply these findings to analyse cluster-like structures in plants' arrangement of Barro Colorado Island rainforest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A comparison of plug-in predictors for lognormal kriging,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.03.002,MAY 2016,22,0,"When skewed spatial data are encountered, a common procedure is to invoke lognormal kriging. The resultant naive lognormal predictors are however biased. A family of optimal predictors which address this unbiasedness has been introduced into the literature by De Oliveira (2006). The behaviour of this family is well documented in the case of known covariance parameters. In contrast, when the covariance parameters are not known and must be estimated, the behaviour of the predictors is unknown. In the present paper, the performance of a subset of the family of predictors formulated by De Oliveira (2006), together with a predictor introduced by Abt et al. (1999), with 'plug-in' estimates of the covariance parameters introduced into the appropriate theoretical formulae, is investigated by means of a simulation study. Results based on eighteen scenarios describing a range of covariance structures and three performance criteria are presented and, in addition, results for a real world example are reported. The main features to emerge from the study are that the naive predictor is negatively biased, that the lognormal predictor is representative of key predictors in the class introduced by De Oliveira (2006) and that the empirical mean squared prediction error severely underestimates the true value.

Universal Kriging of functional data: Trace-variography vs cross-variography? Application to gas forecasting in unconventional shales,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.12.003,FEB 2016,31,3,"In this paper we investigate the practical and methodological use of Universal Kriging of functional data to predict unconventional shale gas production in undrilled locations from known production data. In Universal Kriging of functional data, two approaches are considered: (1) estimation by means of Cokriging of functional components (Universal Cokriging, UCok), requiring cross-variography and (2) estimation by means of trace-variography (Universal Trace-Kriging, UTrK), which avoids cross-variogram modeling. While theoretically, under known variogram structures, such approaches may be quite equivalent, their practical application implies different estimation procedures and modeling efforts. We investigate these differences from the methodological viewpoint and by means of a real field application in the Barnett shale play. An extensive Monte Carlo study inspired from such real field application is employed to support our conclusions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Adaptive geostatistical design and analysis for prevalence surveys,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.12.004,FEB 2016,41,9,"Non-adaptive geostatistical designs (NAGDs) offer standard ways of collecting and analysing geostatistical data in which sampling locations are fixed in advance of any data collection. In contrast, adaptive geostatistical designs (AGDs) allow collection of geostatistical data over time to depend on information obtained from previous information to optimise data collection towards the analysis objective. AGDs are becoming more important in spatial mapping, particularly in poor resource settings where uniformly precise mapping may be unrealistically costly and the priority is often to identify critical areas where interventions can have the most health impact. Two constructions are: singleton and batch adaptive sampling. In singleton sampling, locations xi are chosen sequentially and at each stage, x(k+1) depends on data obtained at locations x(1), ... , x(k). In batch sampling, locations are chosen in batches of size b > 1, allowing each new batch, {x((k+1)), ... , x((k+ b))}, to depend on data obtained at locations x(1), ... , x(kb). In most settings, batch sampling is more realistic than singleton sampling. We propose specific batch AGDs and assess their efficiency relative to their singleton adaptive and non-adaptive counterparts using simulations. We then show how we are applying these findings to inform an AGD of a rolling Malaria Indicator Survey, part of a large-scale, five-year malaria transmission reduction project in Malawi.

Matern thinned Cox processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.10.005,FEB 2016,25,1,"A class of spatial point process models that combine short range repulsion with medium range clustering is introduced. The model is motivated by patterns of centres of non-overlapping spherical cells in biological tissue which tend to have a clustering behaviour. Such a combination of clustering and hard core behaviour can be achieved by applying a dependent Matern thinning to a Cox process. An exact formula for the intensity of a Matern thinned shot noise Cox process is derived from the Palm distribution. For the more general class of Matern thinned Cox processes, formulae for the intensity and second-order characteristics are established using the conditional Poisson assumption. These formulae include more complicated integrals for which approximations are suggested to simplify calculations. An example from pathology illustrates the applicability of the models.

Fractional bivariate exponential estimator for long-range dependent random field,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.11.001,FEB 2016,39,0,"Estimating long-range dependence parameter of a random field, which provides a measure for the extent of long-range dependence, is a challenging problem. Fractional Bivariate EXponential (FBEXP) estimator is proposed for long-range dependence parameter estimation in random fields observed on a regular lattice. FBEXP is a generalized version of the commonly used FEXP estimator in time series. FBEXP estimator belongs to the class of broadband semiparametric estimators, which makes it free from the optimal bandwidth selection problem, present in other semiparametric estimators. The behavior of FBEXP estimator depends on the model order of bivariate exponential model. Three data-driven model order selection criteria are introduced to serve as a guide in appropriate choice of model order for efficient estimation of long-range dependence using FBEXP. The finite sample performance of the FBEXP estimator and model order selection criteria are illustrated via simulation study. FBEXP estimator provides an efficient estimate for the long-range dependence parameter, especially when the spectral density is sufficiently smooth everywhere except at the points of singularities. Total column ozone amounts in Europe and Mediterranean region illustrate the applicability of FBEXP estimator in providing efficient estimates for direction specific long-range dependence parameters and the spectral density of the process.

Isotropy test for spatial point processes using stochastic reconstruction,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.12.002,FEB 2016,25,2,"We develop a model-free isotropy test for spatial point patterns. The proposed test statistic assesses the discrepancy between the uniform distribution and the empirical normalised reduced second-order moment measure of a sector of increasing central angle. The null distribution of the test statistic is approximated by the empirical distribution obtained from bootstrap-type samples, which are generated by a stochastic procedure reconstructing independent isotropic patterns that resemble the spatial structure of the given point pattern, without specifying any underlying model. Simulation studies show that, when compared with the asymptotic chi(2)-test by Guan et al. (2006), the powers of the proposed test are more robust to different choices of user-chosen parameter. When applied to patterns of amacrine cells and Spanish towns, the bootstrap-type test clearly suggests rejection for the former and not rejection for the latter, while the asymptotic chi(2)-test is not conclusive in either case.

Variational Bayes approach for classification of points in superpositions of point processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.12.001,FEB 2016,14,0,"We investigate the problem of classifying superpositions of spatial point processes. In particular, we are interested in realizations formed as a superposition of a regular point process and a Poisson point process. The aim is to decide which of the two processes each point belongs to. Recently, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was suggested by Redenbach et al. (2015), which however, is computationally heavy. In this paper, we will introduce a method based on variational Bayes approximation and compare its performance to the performance of a slightly refined version of the MCMC approach.

We develop a two-stage non-parametric method for quantifying geometric anisotropy arising for example when the pattern is compressed or stretched. First, we fit ellipsoids to the pattern of pairwise difference vectors to estimate the direction of anisotropy. Then, we estimate the scale of anisotropy by identifying the back-transformation resulting in the most isotropic pattern. We demonstrate the applicability of the method mainly for regular patterns by numerical examples, and use it to improve the estimation of compression in 3D polar ice air bubble patterns.

Downscaling and correction of regional climate models outputs with a hybrid geostatistical approach,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.04.006,NOV 2015,47,3,"This paper presents an approach to downscaling of climate models based on a combination of Generalised-additive-models and geostatistics. The paper aims at increasing the usefulness of Climate Models by creating data sets with a spatio-temporal resolution appropriate for applications of environmental models at the management scale. Simulations of climate change available from global and regional climate models require downscaling and bias correction for hydrological or ecological applications. The paper assess the effectiveness of the approach applied to monthly means of temperature and rainfall, to predict soil wetness conditions. The main focus was on reconstructing the spatial structure of the landscape. The climate model data were firstly downscaled using a geo-statistical approach combining generalised additive models (GAMs) with kriging, making use of the covariates to reproduce the spatial pattern. The downscaled climate model data were corrected for bias using interpolated meteorological ground station data (1961-1999). In general the downscaling approach provided lower RMSE and closer reproduction of the variogram structure. The use of the bias corrected downscaled data improved the results of the model used to predict soil wetness, increasing the validation metrics. The approach is completely implemented in open-source software, in particular GRASS-GIS and R. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Global geographic and feature space coverage of temperature data in the context of spatio-temporal interpolation,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.04.005,NOV 2015,46,5,"This article highlights the results of an assessment of representation and usability of global temperature station data for global spatio-temporal analysis. Datasets from the Global Surface Summary of Day (GSOD) and the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) were merged and consisted of 10,695 global stations for the year 2011. Three aspects of data quality were considered: (a) representation in the geographical domain, (b) representation in the feature space (based on the MaxEnt method), and (c) usability i.e. fitness of use for spatio-temporal interpolation based on cross-validation of spatio-temporal regression-kriging models. The results indicate significant clustering of meteorological stations in the combined data set in both geographical and feature space. The majority of the distribution of stations (84%) can be explained by population density and accessibility maps. Consequently, higher elevations areas and inaccessible areas that are sparsely populated are significantly under-represented. Under-representation also reflects on the results of spatio-temporal analysis. Spatio-temporal regression-kriging model of mean daily temperature using 8-day MODIS LST images, as covariate, produces average global accuracy of 2-3 degrees C. Prediction of temperature for polar areas and mountains is 2 times lower than for areas densely covered with meteorological stations. Balanced spatio-temporal regression models that account for station clustering are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial pattern of North Atlantic Oscillation impact on rainfall in Serbia,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.04.007,NOV 2015,34,3,"This study examines the spatial pattern of relationships between annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall in Serbia, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) for the period of 1961-2009. The first correlation analysis between rainfall and the NAO was performed using a Pearson product-moment test. Results suggested negative, mainly statistically significant correlations at annual and winter scales as was expected. However, the highest percentage of stations showed significant result in October suggesting a strong impact of a large scale atmospheric mode throughout a wet season in Serbia. Further spatial analysis that incorporated a spatial autocorrelation statistic of correlation coefficients showed significant clustering at all temporal scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Mapping of maximum snow load values for the 50-year return period for Croatia,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.05.002,NOV 2015,39,0,"Snow load is an important climatic element that is, together with minimum and maximum temperatures and wind load, a part of the national annex of standards for the design of structures. In particular, the characteristic snow load, defined as the maximum snow load at the ground for the 50-year return period, has to be estimated and a map has to be supplied as part of the national annex. The method for the estimation of this parameter at the station locations is presented, followed by the geostatistical mapping procedure used to estimate this parameter for the whole territory of Croatia. Snow load is defined as a product of snow density, snow depth and gravitational acceleration. Although snow depths are measured at a large number of meteorological stations, snow loads are not easy to estimate because of very few snow density measurements. To overcome this, snow density was fitted to snow depth data using linear regression according to the daily pairs of values from 13 meteorological stations. Since snow density changes with elevations and seasons, the stations are divided into three subsets according to station elevation (lower than 600 m, 600-1000 m high and higher than 1000 m) and the regression equations are also built on a monthly basis. These modelling results allowed the estimation of the snow load at 96 low-elevation stations, eight higher elevation stations and one high-altitude station based on the monthly maximum snow depths and the model estimated snow densities. Based on the monthly maximum snow loads, the series of maximum annual snow loads can be calculated for 118 locations. These series of annual maximum snow loads are the basis for the estimation of the annual maximum snow load values for the 50-year return period, by means of an extreme value distribution.

Finally, the estimated annual maximum snow load values for the 50-year return period at 118 stations constitute the input for the geostatistical procedure of mapping this parameter for the territory of Croatia.

Two approaches to geostatistical modeling and spatio-temporal predictions are described: (1) 3D + T predictive modeling using random forests algorithms, and (2) 3D + T kriging model after detrending the observations for depth-dependent seasonal effects. All the analyses used data from the Cook Agronomy Farm (37 ha), which includes hourly measurements of soil volumetric water content, temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity at 42 stations and five depths (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 m), collected over five years. This data set also includes 2-and 3-dimensional, temporal, and spatio-temporal covariates covering the same area. The results of (strict) leave-onestation- out cross-validation indicate that both models accurately predicted soil temperature, while predictive power was lower for water content, and lowest for electrical conductivity. The kriging model explained 37%, 96%, and 18% of the variability in water content, temperature, and electrical conductivity respectively versus 34%, 93%, and 5% explained by the random forests model. A less rigorous simple cross-validation of the random forests model indicated improved predictive power when at least some data were available for each station, explaining 86%, 97%, and 88% of the variability in water content, temperature, and electrical conductivity respectively. The high difference between the strict and simple cross-validation indicates high temporal auto-correlation of values at measurement stations. Temporal model components (i.e. day of the year and seasonal trends) explained most of the variability in observations in both models for all three variables. The seamless predictions of 3D + T data produced from this analysis can assist in understanding soil processes and how they change through a season, under different land management scenarios, and how they relate to other environmental processes.

"Evaluating machine learning approaches for the interpolation of monthly air temperature at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania",SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.05.008,NOV 2015,78,11,"Spatially high resolution climate information is required for a variety of applications in but not limited to functional biodiversity research. In order to scale the generally plot-based research findings to a landscape level, spatial interpolation methods of meteorological variables are required. Based on a network of temperature observation plots across the southern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, the skill of 14 machine learning algorithms in predicting spatial temperature patterns is tested and evaluated against the heavily utilized kriging approach. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation testing design, regression trees generally perform better than linear and non-linear regression models. The best individual performance has been observed by the stochastic gradient boosting model followed by Cubist, random forest and model averaged neural networks which except for the latter are all regression tree-based algorithms. While these machine learning algorithms perform better than kriging in a quantitative evaluation, the overall visual interpretation of the resulting air temperature maps is ambiguous. Here, a combined Cubist and residual kriging approach can be considered the best solution. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

FLP estimation of semi-parametric models for space-time point processes and diagnostic tools,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.06.004,NOV 2015,42,7,"The conditional intensity function of a space-time branching model is defined by the sum of two main components: the longrun term intensity and short-run term one. Their simultaneous estimation is a complex issue that usually requires the use of hard computational techniques. This paper deals with a new mixed estimation approach for a particular space-time branching model, the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model. This approach uses a simultaneous estimation of the different model components, alternating a parametric step for estimating the induced component by Maximum Likelihood and a non-parametric estimation step, for the background intensity, by FLP (Forward Predictive Likelihood).

Moreover, proper graphical tools for diagnostics have been developed and collected, together with the used implemented code in a R package here introduced, named etasFLP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Voronoi residuals and other residual analyses applied to CSEP earthquake forecasts,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.06.001,NOV 2015,27,3,"Voronoi residuals, deviances, super- thinning, and some other residual analysis methods are applied to a selection of earthquake forecast models in the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP). Unlike simple numerical summaries such as the N-test, L-test, or R-test, graphical residual methods are proposed which can be useful for comparing multiple models and for highlighting when and where a given model does not agree closely with the observed seismicity. For gridded forecasts, deviances seem ideally suited for model comparison, and Voronoi residuals seem preferable to simple grid-based residuals for assessing one model individually. For models outputting an estimated conditional rate at any particular space-time location, Voronoi residuals and superthinning can be especially useful at identifying departures from the data.

Windowed ETAS models with application to the Chilean seismic catalogs,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.05.006,NOV 2015,25,4,"The seismicity in Chile is estimated using an ETAS (Epidemic Type Aftershock sequences) space-time point process through a semi-parametric technique to account for the estimation of parametric and nonparametric components simultaneously. The two components account for triggered and background seismicity respectively, and are estimated by alternating a ML estimation for the parametric part and a forward predictive likelihood technique for the nonparametric one. Given the geographic and seismological characteristics of Chile, the sensitivity of the technique with respect to different geographical areas is examined in overlapping successive windows with varying latitude. A different behavior of background and triggered seismicity in the different windows is observed and analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of massive marked point patterns with stochastic partial differential equations,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.06.003,NOV 2015,46,3,"In this paper we describe a novel approach to modelling marked point patterns based on recent computational developments for Bayesian inference. We use the flexible class of log-Gaussian Cox Processes to model the intensity of the different observed point patterns. We propose several types of models to account for spatial variability and provide a modelling framework that allows for a common spatial component to all point processes (regardless of the mark) and also for a mark-specific spatial components. In this way, we provide a method of assessing whether all processes share a common spatial distribution or there are specific features.

In order to fit these models, we have resorted to the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) method and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach. This defines a connection between point process and geostatistics, as we model a point pattern by means of a continuous spatial process.

A changepoint analysis of spatio-temporal point processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.05.005,NOV 2015,17,4,"This work introduces a Bayesian approach to detecting multiple unknown changepoints over time in the inhomogeneous intensity of a spatio-temporal point process with spatial and temporal dependence within segments. We propose a new method for detecting changes by fitting a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process model using the computational efficiency and flexibility of integrated nested Laplace approximation, and by studying the posterior distribution of the potential changepoint positions. In this paper, the context of the problem and the research questions are introduced, then the methodology is presented and discussed in detail. A simulation study assesses the validity and properties of the proposed methods. Lastly, questions are addressed concerning potential unknown changepoints in the intensity of radioactive particles found on Sandside beach, Dounreay, Scotland. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Non-extensive analysis of the seismic activity involving the 2011 volcanic eruption in El Hierro,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.08.001,NOV 2015,35,1,"This paper is focused on the assessment of possible relational elements of the submarine volcanic eruption occurred during 2011 in El Hierro (Canary Islands, Spain) with both the spatiotemporal evolutionary behaviour and the scaling properties of seismic activity before, during and after it. We adopt the nonextensive frequency-magnitude distribution (FMD) model (Silva et al., 2006) for fitting to observed data, where we introduce a weighting function based on the relation between magnitude and energy. Moreover, extension of dependence coefficients in terms of Tsallis entropy (Furuichi, 2006) to the multifractal domain is proposed to study dimensional interaction in terms of the Tsallis generalized dimensions formulation introduced in Angulo and Esquivel (2014). The study shows significant changes in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the seismic activity previous to the volcanic eruption. The combination of these techniques can be seen as a suitable tool in the continuous monitoring of volcanic activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Accounting for model sensitivity in controlled (log)Gaussian geostatistical simulation,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.05.007,NOV 2015,23,0,"Geostatistical simulation using controlled or stratified sampling methods, namely Latin hypercube and stratified likelihood sampling, are capable of generating representative realizations from (log) Gaussian random fields, i.e., spanning efficiently the range of values corresponding to the (log) Gaussian multivariate probability distribution. Although such realizations often serve as parameters for physical process simulators, existing controlled sampling methods do not account for model sensitivity; hence, they need not yield representative realizations of model outputs. To address this shortcoming, controlled sampling methods are embedded within a two-step simulation procedure. The first step involves stratified sampling at a set of control points where attribute values are expected to exert a large impact on model predictions and/or where uncertainty in such predictions is expected to be largest. In the second step, control point samples are used to generate attribute realizations over the entire study region using classical geostatistical simulation. The application of the proposed controlled, two-step, geostatistical simulation procedure is illustrated in a hydrogeological context via a synthetic case study involving physically-based simulation of flow and transport in a porous medium with known boundary and initial conditions over a simple geometrical domain.

Universal kriging with training images,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.04.004,NOV 2015,63,3,"In the past decade, the training image (TI) has received considerable attention as a source for modeling spatial continuity in geostatistics. In this paper, the use of TIs in the context of kriging is investigated, specifically universal kriging (UK). Traditionally, kriging relies on a random function model formulation whereby the target variable is decomposed into a trend and residual. While the theory is firm and elegant, the actual practice of UK remains challenging; in particular when data is sparse, and the modeler has to decide what to model as the trend and as the residual. This paper juxtaposes this variogram-based universal kriging (UK-v) with a TI-based approach (UK-TI). It is found that the latter need not rely on random function theory, but rather on the specification of a TI on which ""universal'' conditions are verified. Through illustrations with examples, it is seen that the modeling challenge in UK-TI is on the training image. Using a Monte Carlo study, the statistical performance of both methods is found to be comparable. Recommendations on which method to choose, based on practical criteria, are also formulated. Additionally, the study provides more insight into the use of the TI in general, including in multiple-point geostatistics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Time varying spatio-temporal covariance models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.06.006,NOV 2015,36,3,"In this paper, we introduce valid parametric covariance models for univariate and multivariate spatio-temporal random fields. In contrast to the traditional models, we allow the model parameters to vary over time. Since variables in applications usually exhibit seasonality or changes in dependency structures, the allowance of varying parameters would be beneficial in terms of improving model flexibility. Conditions in constructing valid covariance models and discussions on practical implementation will be provided. As an application, a set of air pollution data observed from a monitoring network will be modeled. It is found that the time varying model performs better in prediction compared with the traditional models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Spatial parameterization of infant mortality in Anhui Province, China",SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.06.007,NOV 2015,29,0,"The study is motivated by an unexplained and relatively high infant mortality in Anhui Province, where a suspected unknown source may contribute to it. However, spatially focused disease clustering tests tend to base on a known location, and in many cases, use the point source as the referent. When elevated risks in some areas are caused by unknown sources, it becomes necessary to infer these sources spatially. The paper extends spatial cluster parameterization models from known sources to unknown sources by a profile likelihood method. In both simulation and extended case study, we show that the spatial parameterization method is able to effectively identify the cluster influence center and measure cluster strength. We found that the center is located where the borders of several counties met in a relatively well-to-do part of the province. In addition to its ability to identify cluster influence away from the traditional centroid point, the parameterized method tends to perform better than the common spatial cluster detection method in terms of goodness of fit statistic and location specificity.

Signal-Controlled Least Square Collocation: A new quality in geostatistical estimation and simulation?,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.06.008,NOV 2015,21,0,"Geostatistical estimation and simulation algorithms are designed to provide the most likely forecast as well as information about the accuracy of the prediction. The representativeness of these measures strongly depends on the quality of inferred model parameters, which are mainly defined by the parameters of the variogram or the covariance function. Available data may be scarce, trend affected and of different data type making the inference of representative geostatistical model parameters difficult.

This contribution introduces a new method for best fitting of geostatistical model parameters in the presence of a trend, which utilizes empirical and theoretical differences between Universal Kriging and trend-predictions. The method is called ""SignalControlled Collocation'' and extends well known approaches of cross validation in two aspects. Firstly, the model evaluation is not only limited to sample data locations but is performed on any prediction location of the attribute in the domain. Secondly, it extends the measure used in cross validation, based on a single point replacement by using error curves. These allow the definition of rings of influence representing errors resulting from separate variogram lags.

The formal description of the method is provided followed by two case studies related to the prediction of mining-induced ground movements and resource modelling of heavy mineral deposits. Recommendations for future research are given. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Impact of age, race and socio-economic status on temporal trends in late-stage prostate cancer diagnosis in Florida",SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.07.002,NOV 2015,41,3,"Individual-level data from the Florida Cancer Data System (19812007) were analyzed to explore temporal trends of prostate cancer late-stage diagnosis, and how they vary based on race, income and age. Annual census-tract rates were computed for two races (white and black) and two age categories (40-65, >65) before being aggregated according to census tract median household incomes. Joinpoint regression and a new disparity statistic were applied to model temporal trends and detect potential racial and socioeconomic differences. Multi-dimensional scaling was used as an innovative way to visualize similarities among temporal trends in a 2-D space. Analysis of time-series indicated that late-stage diagnosis was generally more prevalent among blacks, for age category 40-64 compared to older patients covered by Medicare, and among classes of lower socio-economic status. Joinpoint regression also showed that the rate of decline in late-stage diagnosis was similar among older patients. For younger patients,the decline occurred at a faster pace for blacks with rates becoming similar to whites in the late 1990s, in particular for higher incomes. Both races displayed distinct spatial patterns with higher rates of late-stage diagnosis in the Florida Panhandle for whites whereas high rates clustered in South-eastern Florida for blacks.

Estimation of a non-stationary model for annual precipitation in southern Norway using replicates of the spatial field,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.07.003,NOV 2015,37,6,"Estimation of stationary dependence structure parameters using only a single realisation of the spatial process, typically leads to inaccurate estimates and poorly identified parameters. A common way to handle this is to fix some of the parameters, or within the Bayesian framework, impose prior knowledge. In many applied settings, stationary models are not flexible enough to model the process of interest, thus non-stationary spatial models are used. However, more flexible models usually means more parameters, and the identifiability problem becomes even more challenging. We investigate aspects of estimation of a Bayesian non-stationary spatial model for annual precipitation using observations from multiple years. The model contains replicates of the spatial field, which increases precision of the estimates and makes them less prior sensitive. Using R-INLA, we analyse precipitation data from southern Norway, and investigate statistical properties of the replicate model in a simulation study. The non-stationary spatial model we explore belongs to a recently introduced class of stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) based spatial models. This model class allows for non-stationary models with explanatory variables in the dependence structure. We derive conditions to facilitate prior specification for these types of non-stationary spatial models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A test for robust detection of residual spatial autocorrelation with application to mortality rates in Sweden,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.07.001,NOV 2015,16,3,"Background: When analyzing data collected with a geographical dimension it is important to be able to test for spatial autocorrelation. The presence of spatial autocorrelation might unveil ignored explanatory variables or just be a factor necessary to consider when further analyzing the data.

Objectives: The aim of this paper is to propose a new test that works well for detecting spatial autocorrelation, which is robust against heteroscedasticity and useful regardless of the underlying distribution. The new test is then used to investigate if the mortality rates in the aging Swedish population show spatial autocorrelation as an example of its use.

Methods: We derive such a test assuming the mean function for the model is known and perform simulations for this case and for residuals to investigate its finite sample performance, especially how the nominal rejection size is kept.

Results: In the simulations we show that our test works well if there is no heteroscedasticity and also under difficult situations such as heteroscedasticity with structure, given that sufficient number of observations are available. This study finds no autocorrelation of mortality rates in Swedish municipalities in the age group 64-75 in year 2006. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Transformed Gaussian Markov random fields and spatial modeling of species abundance,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.07.004,NOV 2015,56,1,"Gaussian random field and Gaussian Markov random field have been widely used to accommodate spatial dependence under the generalized linear mixed models framework. To model spatial count and spatial binary data, we present a class of transformed Gaussian Markov random fields, constructed by transforming the margins of a Gaussian Markov random field to desired marginal distributions that accommodate asymmetry and heavy tail, as needed in many empirical circumstances. The Gaussian copula that characterizes the dependence structure facilitates inferences and applications in modeling spatial dependence. This construction leads to new models such as gamma or beta Markov fields with Gaussian copulas, that are used to model Poisson intensities or Bernoulli rates in hierarchical spatial analyses. The method is naturally implemented in a Bayesian framework. To illustrate our methodology, abundances of variety of gastropod species were collected as counts or presence versus absence from a network of spatial locations in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. Gastropods are of considerable ecological importance in terrestrial ecosystems because of their species richness, abundances, and critical roles in ecosystem processes such as decomposition and nutrient cy-cling. The new models outperform the traditional models based on Bayesian model comparison with conditional predictive ordinate. The validity of Bayesian inferences and model selection were assessed through simulation studies for both spatial Poisson regression and spatial Bernoulli regression. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial cluster detection using nearest neighbor distance,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.07.006,NOV 2015,42,0,"Motivated by the analysis of the impact of ecological processes on spatial distribution of tree species, we introduce in this paper a novel approach to detect spatial cluster of points. Our procedure is based on an iterative transformation of the distance between points into a measure of closeness. Our measure has the advantage of being independent of an arbitrary cluster shape and allowing adjustment for covariates. The comparison of the observed measure of closeness to a reference point process leads to a hierarchical clustering of spatial points. The selection of the optimal number of clusters is performed using the Gap statistic. Our procedure is illustrated on a spatial distribution of the Dicorynia guianensis species in the French Guiana terra firme rainforest. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Accuracy of areal interpolation methods for count data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.07.005,NOV 2015,20,4,"The combination of several socio-economic data bases originating from different administrative sources collected on several different partitions of a geographic zone of interest into administrative units induces the so-called areal interpolation problem. This problem is that of allocating the data from a set of source spatial units to a set of target spatial units. In the literature, there are three main types of such techniques: proportional weighting schemes, smoothing techniques and regression based interpolation. We propose a stochastic model based on Poisson point processes to study the statistical accuracy of these techniques for regular grid targets in the case of count data. For simplicity, we restrict attention to count related target variables, proportional weighting schemes and Poisson regression based methods. The error depends on many factors including the relative size of the targets with respect to the sources, the homogeneity of the auxiliary information variables and the relative importance of the different auxiliary information in themean target values. Our conclusion is that there is no technique which always dominates at finite distance but that asymptotically the pycnophylactic Poisson regression is the best feasible method among the ones considered.

Bayesian marked point process modeling for generating fully synthetic public use data with point-referenced geography,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.07.008,NOV 2015,46,4,"Many data stewards collect confidential data that include fine geography. When sharing these data with others, data stewards strive to disseminate data that are informative for a wide range of spatial and non-spatial analyses while simultaneously protecting the confidentiality of data subjects' identities and attributes. Typically, data stewards meet this challenge by coarsening the resolution of the released geography and, as needed, perturbing the confidential attributes. When done with high intensity, these redaction strategies can result in released data with poor analytic quality. We propose an alternative dissemination approach based on fully synthetic data. We generate data using marked point process models that can maintain both the statistical properties and the spatial dependence structure of the confidential data. We illustrate the approach using data consisting of mortality records from Durham, North Carolina.

On regression analysis of spatial proportional data with zero/one values,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.07.007,NOV 2015,26,3,"Proportions including exact zero and/or one values observed at spatial locations in a study area are often encountered in environmental and ecological studies. In this paper, we propose a new spatial beta-Bernoulli mixture model that combines a beta distribution and a Bernoulli distribution. The beta component links the original response on the open unit interval (0, 1) to covariates via regression and is flexible to capture a variety of shapes of the data distributions. Further, the Bernoulli component models the probability of zero/one values with regression. In addition, we propose a novel spatial generalized Tobit model which extends an existing spatial Tobit model by applying an inverse beta cumulative distribution function transformation. A composite likelihood approach is developed for parameter estimation by maximizing a pairwise likelihood function for each model. The standard errors of the parameter estimates are obtained via the inverse of the Godambe information matrix. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed models and methods, followed by an ecological data example. Connections among the spatial betaBernoulli mixture model, the spatial generalized Tobit model, and the spatial Tobit model are explored using both simulated and real data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Semi-parametric pairwise inference methods in spatial models based on copulas,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.08.002,NOV 2015,28,3,"In this paper, semi-parametric models based on copulas are considered for the modeling of stationary and isotropic spatial random fields. To this end, a general family of multivariate distributions is introduced in which the dependence structure between any finite sets of locations is modeled via a copula and where the strength of the relationships between any two locations is controlled by a link function. Because the density of most of the multivariate spatial copulas is untractable, it is proposed that inferential procedures for these models be based on a pairwise approach taking into account the bivariate densities only. Specifically, a rank-based estimation procedure using the so-called pairwise likelihood is proposed and a semi-parametric spatial interpolation method for the prediction at un-sampled locations is developed; both methods are investigated with the help of simulated spatial random fields. The usefulness of the newly introduced tools is illustrated on the Meuse river data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Analyzing spatiotemporal trends in social media data via smoothing spline analysis of variance,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.09.002,NOV 2015,52,3,"Social media have become an integral part of life for many individuals, and social media websites generate incredible amounts of data on a variety of societal topics. Furthermore, some social media posts contain geolocation information, so social media data can be viewed as a spatiotemporal phenomenon. To understand spatiotemporal trends in ultra-large sample social media data, we propose a novel application of the Smoothing Spline Analysis of Variance (SSANOVA) framework, which is a nonparametric approach capable of discovering latent functional relationships in noisy data. Unlike currently available approaches, our proposed SSANOVA framework (a) makes few assumptions about the nature of the spatiotemporal trend, (b) provides a mean of assessing the uncertainty of the estimated spatiotemporal trend, and (c) is scalable to analyze massive samples of social media data. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we model the daily spatiotemporal Twitter trend in the United States. Our results reveal that the proposed SSANOVA approach can provide accurate and informative estimates of spatiotemporal social media trends, as well as useful information about the precision of the estimated spatiotemporal trends.

Does non-stationary spatial data always require non-stationary random fields?,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.10.001,NOV 2015,58,13,"A stationary spatial model is an idealization and we expect that the true dependence structures of physical phenomena are spatially varying, but how should we handle this non-stationarity in practice? Westudy the challenges involved in applying a flexible non-stationary model to a dataset of annual precipitation in the conterminous US, where exploratory data analysis shows strong evidence of a non-stationary covariance structure.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the modelling pipeline once non-stationarity has been detected in spatial data. We show that there is a real danger of over-fitting the model and that careful modelling is necessary in order to properly account for varying second-order structure. In fact, the example shows that sometimes non-stationary Gaussian random fields are not necessary to model non-stationary spatial data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Linear street extraction using a Conditional Random Field model,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.10.003,NOV 2015,44,1,A novel method for extracting linear streets from a street network is proposed where a linear street is defined as a sequence of connected street segments having a shape similar to a straight line segment. Specifically a given street network is modeled as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) where the task of extracting linear streets corresponds to performing learning and inference with respect to this model. The energy function of the proposed CRF model is submodular and consequently exact inference can be performed in polynomial time. This contrasts with traditional solutions to the problem of extracting linear streets which employ heuristic search procedures and cannot guarantee that the optimal solution will be found. The performance of the proposed method is quantified in terms of identifying those types or classes of streets which generally exhibit the characteristic of being linear. Results achieved on a large evaluation dataset demonstrate that the proposed method greatly outperforms the aforementioned traditional solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Spatio-temporal geostatistical modeling for French fertility predictions,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.10.002,NOV 2015,58,1,"Fertility evolution in France shows a countertrend compared to the common pattern of fertility in Europe. Based on aggregate statistics, such as the Total Fertility Rate (TFR), the population of France, as compared to all the other European countries, has one of the highest levels of fertility. The TFR has increased in the last 15 years although the growth rate is decreasing. Indeed the TFR shows a tendency to stabilize at around 2.0, as confirmed, with small variability, for each region. The aim of the paper is to propose spatio-temporal geostatistical modeling for the French TFR. In particular, a stochastic method for spatio-temporal prediction is proposed. Although time series analysis has been widely used to describe the temporal evolution of various demographic variables, recently increasing attention has also been given to the study of the spatial distribution of these variables. Thus, in this paper, geostatistical spatio-temporal tools are appropriately used to study simultaneously both the spatial and the temporal behavior of the regional TFR in France for prediction purposes.

Spatial point pattern identification of an apparent Ice-Age house structure,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.09.003,NOV 2015,45,1,"Archaeological excavations of a late Ice-Age (Pleistocene) site on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado uncovered large rocks that were suspected to be the remains of a house structure. Classical statistical analyses supported this possible conclusion but could not characterize the possible shape of the structure. Analyses using Ripley's K-function and an adaptation called the L-function confirmed the strong likelihood that the location pattern was not homogeneous across the site. Both nearby regularity and more distant clustering were identified. Circular and elliptical fits to the rock locations were compared using L-function simulation envelopes. The simulation envelopes provided strong evidence that the large rocks formed a circular pattern, suggesting that they formed the foundation of a prehistoric house structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Filtering remotely sensed chlorophyll concentrations in the Red Sea using a space-time covariance model and a Kalman filter,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.04.002,AUG 2015,43,2,"A statistical model is proposed to filter satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration from the Red Sea, and to predict future chlorophyll concentrations. The seasonal trend is first estimated after filling missing chlorophyll data using an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF)-based algorithm (Data Interpolation EOF). The anomalies are then modeled as a stationary Gaussian process. A method proposed by Gneiting (2002) is used to construct positive-definite space-time covariance models for this process. After choosing an appropriate statistical model and identifying its parameters, Kriging is applied in the space-time domain to make a one step ahead prediction of the anomalies. The latter serves as the prediction model of a reduced-order Kalman filter, which is applied to assimilate and predict future chlorophyll concentrations. The proposed method decreases the root mean square (RMS) prediction error by about 11% compared with the seasonal average. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Optimising sampling designs for the maximum coverage problem of plume detection,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.03.004,AUG 2015,44,2,"The location of sensors to detect outbreaks of hazardous plumes in the atmosphere can be improved by considering possible paths of such plumes. Atmospheric dispersion models can provide simulations of such paths under realistic weather conditions. Numeric simulation always goes along with discretisation, and if a plume is detected or not can be regarded as a binary question. Thus optimising the locations of a fixed number of sensors can be regarded as finite; in fact it is a variety of the classical maximum coverage problem. We present an algorithm to completely solve this problem. It is based on complete deep tree search that finds all globally optimal sensor configurations, but the effort is reduced by skipping non-promising configurations and deleting redundant data. To determine the effort and to learn about optimal sensor configurations, the algorithm was tested on several scenarios based on plume simulations or on random data. This was completed by some theoretical results on the effect of problem size and plume detection probability on the effort. Finally we used the determined optimal configurations to evaluate two well known heuristics: greedy search and a genetic algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Estimation of space deformation model for non-stationary random functions,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.05.001,AUG 2015,34,7,"Stationary Random Functions have been successfully applied in geostatistical applications for decades. In some instances, the assumption of a homogeneous spatial dependence structure across the entire domain of interest is unrealistic. A practical approach for modeling and estimating non-stationary spatial dependence structure is considered. This consists in transforming a non-stationary Random Function into a stationary and isotropic one via a bijective continuous deformation of the index space. So far, this approach has been successfully applied in the context of data from several independent realizations of a Random Function. In this work, we propose an approach for non-stationary geostatistical modeling using space deformation in the context of a single realization with possibly irregularly spaced data. The estimation method is based on a non-stationary variogram kernel estimator which serves as a dissimilarity measure between two locations in the geographical space. The proposed procedure combines aspects of kernel smoothing, weighted non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and thin-plate spline radial basis functions. On a simulated data, the method is able to retrieve the true deformation. Performances are assessed on both synthetic and real datasets. It is shown in particular that our approach outperforms the stationary approach. Beyond the prediction, the proposed method can also serve as a tool for exploratory analysis of the non-stationarity.

Cross-correlation modeling of European windstorms: A cokriging approach for optimizing surface wind estimates,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.05.003,AUG 2015,38,5,"Maximum sustained and peak gust winds from eighteen European windstorms over the last 25 years were analyzed previously to develop surface-level wind predictions across a large and topographically varied landscape based on an anisotropic kriging interpolation methodology for meteorological station data. Results suggested that coastal and mountainous areas experience the highest wind speeds and highest variability over short distances, resulting in the highest errors across concurrent interpolated surfaces. This study utilizes covariates in conjunction with cokriging to investigate the use of cokriging as a method of improvement through the interpolation of five windstorms that impacted both the Alps region and the topographically-varied coastal regions of Western Europe. Results show that cokriging improves isotach interpolation for windstorms in 8 out of 10 models by reducing root mean square error and the total number of high-error stations, primarily in coastal and mountainous areas. Land cover alone contributed to the greatest model improvement in a majority of the models, while aspect and elevation (singularly and collectively) also improved models when compared to original kriging models. Improved surface interpolation is critical for improved understanding of macro-scale windstorm patterns and resulting damage, thus improving risk and vulnerability estimates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Measuring aggregation of events about a mass using spatial point pattern methods,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.05.004,AUG 2015,29,1,"We present a methodology that detects event aggregation about a mass surface using 3-dimensional study regions with a point pattern and a mass present. The Aggregation about a Mass function determines aggregation, randomness, or repulsion of events with respect to the mass surface. Our method closely resembles Ripley's K function but is modified to discern the pattern about the mass surface. We briefly state the definition and derivation of Ripley's K function and explain how the Aggregation about a Mass function is different. We develop the novel function according to the definition: the Aggregation about a Mass function times the intensity is the expected number of events within a distance h of a mass. Special consideration of edge effects is taken in order to make the function invariant to the location of the mass within the study region. Significance of aggregation or repulsion is determined using simulation envelopes. A simulation study is performed to inform researchers how the Aggregation about a Mass function performs under different types of aggregation. Finally, we apply the Aggregation about a Mass function to neuroscience as a novel analysis tool by examining the spatial pattern of neurotransmitter release sites as events about a neuron.

Spatial pattern development of selective logging over several years,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2015.03.001,AUG 2015,31,1,"Selective logging gives currently a major contribution to ongoing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonia. On satellite images, log-landing sites (LLS) are well visible, and they serve as a proxy to selective logging activities. In this study we analysed the spatial patterns of the LLS collected during the years 2000-2009 in a part of the Brazilian Amazonia, using spatial statistical methods. The purpose was to reveal important spatial and temporal characteristics of selective logging. After the spatial analysis, the patterns formed by the LLS were modelled using the higher-order Gibbs interaction models due to their suitability to model clustered patterns. The area-interaction model and Geyer's saturation model proved effective in modelling the clustered patterns in the absence of information about covariates. Results of both models conform closely to each other. We conclude that spatial statistical methods are powerful tools for analysing and interpreting the spatial patterns formed by selective logging.

Bayesian spatial-temporal modeling of air pollution data with dynamic variance and leptokurtosis,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.05.002,AUG 2018,44,0,"Spatial-temporal modeling is commonly used to explain the dependence of environmental and socio-economic variables over space and time. Early published works usually assumed constant second and fourth moments. In this paper, we propose a new spatial time series model with dynamic variance and kurtosis. A distinctive feature of our proposed model is that for variables of interest, the model allows the variability and tail heaviness (which usually are indicated by the level of leptokurtosis) to change over spatial location and time. We establish Bayesian inference for the proposed model and conduct a simulation study to showcase the model's effectiveness compared with that of a baseline model. Air pollution data from Hong Kong and China's delta region are analyzed to further illustrate the dynamic variance behavior over time and the heavy-tailed characteristics of observations.

Structure identification and model selection in geographically weighted quantile regression models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.05.003,AUG 2018,49,0,"Geographical weighted quantile regression (GWQR) is an important tool for exploring the spatial non-stationarity of the regression relationship and providing the entire description of the response distribution, which is useful in practice because of its robustness against outliers and flexibility in dealing with non-normal distributions. This paper proposes the GWQlasso method for structure identification and variable selection in GWQR models. The proposed method combines the local-linear estimation of the GWQR model and the adaptive group lasso, which can simultaneously identify spatially varying coefficients, non-zero constant coefficients and zero coefficients. The selection consistency and the oracle property of the proposal are studied. Moreover, the derived algorithm for the GWQlasso method and the selection of the tuning parameter by the BIC criterion are established. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Application of Moran Eigenvector Maps (MEM) to irregular sampling designs,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.05.004,AUG 2018,26,0,"Moran's eigenvectors maps (MEM) are attractive mathematical objects as they are fairly simple to calculate and can be used in most studies of spatially-explicit data. There is, however, an aspect of MEM analysis that still requires some investigation: the effect of irregular sampling on their modeling performance. This study investigates empirically the behavior of MEMs under different irregularity schemes. It is focusing on simulated scenarios representing sampling designs frequently encountered in ecology. We advocate that MEMs can be computed and correctly used with data coming from irregularly designed sampling surveys, given some precautions. We suggest that when the sampling sites are equally spaced but do not cover the entire study area, the MEMs can be computed directly on the coordinates of the sampling sites without any important loss of information. Whereas, when the phenomenon of interest is tackled using randomly stratified sampling designs, the MEMs should be computed on a reconstructed space of regular sampling sites followed by removal of the missing sites, before analysis. This solution of rebuilding a (regular) sampling space guarantees to capture the underlying process under study, improves the modeling results and relaxes the impact of the choice of the weighting matrix on the computation of MEMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Log Gaussian Cox processes on the sphere,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.06.002,AUG 2018,33,0,"A log Gaussian Cox process (LGCP) is a doubly stochastic construction consisting of a Poisson point process with a random log-intensity given by a Gaussian random field. Statistical methodology have mainly been developed for LGCPs defined in the d-dimensional Euclidean space. This paper concerns the case of LGCPs on the d-dimensional sphere, with d = 2 of primary interest. We discuss the existence problem of such LGCPs, provide sufficient existence conditions, and establish further useful theoretical properties. The results are applied for the description of sky positions of galaxies, in comparison with previous analysis based on a Thomas process, using simple estimation procedures and making a careful model checking. We account for inhomogeneity in our models, and as the model checking is based on a thinning procedure which produces homogeneous/isotropic LGCPs, we discuss its sensitivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As an application we consider a metal-matrix composite with ceramic particles as reinforcing inclusions, model the inclusions as prolate spheroids and estimate the parameters of their distribution from planar sections.

A cause-specific hazard spatial frailty model for competing risks data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.07.004,AUG 2018,64,0,"Competing risks data is often grouped into clusters, such as geographic regions. Shared frailty models can be used to model the correlation between individuals within each cluster. For the better fitting of the model in the competing risks data, one random effect can be used for every type of event in each cluster. But the correlation between random effects in each cluster should also be taken into account. On the other hand, there may also be a spatial correlation between random effects during geographic regions. In this paper, we use cause-specific hazard spatial frailty model with multivariate conditional autoregressive distribution for frailties via Bayesian approach. Simulation studies are used to assess the regression coefficient estimators as well as the variance and correlation of random effects within the clusters. We apply the proposed model to the analysis of the gastrointestinal cancer data of Iran's National Institute of Health Research and the Louisiana breast cancer data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute.

Generalised spatial and spatiotemporal autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.07.005,AUG 2018,67,0,"In this paper, we introduce a new spatial model that incorporates heteroscedastic variance depending on neighbouring locations. The proposed process is considered as the spatial equivalent to the temporal autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model. We also show how the newly introduced spatial ARCH model can be used in spatiotemporal settings. In contrast to the temporal ARCH model, in which the distribution is known given the full information set for the prior periods, the distribution is not straightforward in the spatial and spatiotemporal setting. However, the model parameters can be estimated using the maximum-likelihood approach. Via Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the performance of the estimator for a specific spatial weighting matrix. Moreover, we combine the known spatial autoregressive model with the spatial ARCH model assuming heteroscedastic errors. Eventually, the proposed autoregressive process is illustrated by an empirical example. Specifically, we model lung cancer mortality in 3108 U.S. counties and compare the newly introduced model with four benchmark approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Statistics of spatial averages and optimal averaging in the presence of missing data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.04.002,JUN 2018,27,0,"We estimate statistics of spatial averages defined by linearly weighting available observations over a spatial domain, and derive an account of bias and variance in the presence of missing observations. With missing observations, the spatial average is a ratio of random variables, and estimators are derived by truncating Taylor series of functions of the ratio followed by taking suitable expectations ('delta method'). The resulting estimators are approximate, and perform well when compared with simulations. Previous authors have examined ""optimal averaging"" strategies for minimizing mean squared error (MSE) of a spatial average, and we extend the analysis to the case of missing observations. It is shown that to minimize variance primarily requires higher weights where local variance and covariance are small, whereas minimizing bias requires higher weights where observations lie nearer to true spatial average. Missing data increases variance and contributes to bias, and reducing both effects involves emphasizing locations with observations nearer to the spatial average. The framework is applied to spatially averaged rainfall over India.

A numerical method to account for distance in a farmer's willingness to pay for land,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.04.001,JUN 2018,29,0,"Land transactions between farmers are responsible for landscape changes in rural areas. The price a farmer is willing to pay (WTP) for vacant land depends on the distance of the parcel to the farmstead. Detailed quantitative knowledge of this WTP-distance relationship is of utmost importance for accurate modelling of land markets, and for the design and implementation of effective and robust land consolidation schemes. Practical experience suggests, however that it is not particularly easy to back out the WTP-distance relationship from empirical transaction data. Here, we present a novel statistical framework to help quantify the relationship between a farmer's WTP and the distance of his/her farmstead to the vacant parcel. We describe a land market with a simple statistical model and simulate an artificial archive of land transactions via Monte Carlo sampling. The parameters of our virtual market are estimated from a historical archive of land transactions in the Province of Gelderland The Netherlands, using minimization of the divergence (relative entropy) between the observed and simulated joint distributions of distance and transaction price. A reasonable agreement was observed between the observed and simulated bivariate distributions of distance and transaction price. Our results demonstrate that for short distances (500-1000m) any additional metre distance reduces the WTP by about 60 & euro; ha(-1) . The impact of distance on WAP gradually levels off with larger distance: beyond 5 km the effect has reduced to less than 0.5 & euro; ha(-1) (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Including spatial correlation in structural equation modelling of soil properties,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.04.003,JUN 2018,24,0,"Digital soil mapping techniques usually take an entirely data-driven approach and model soil properties individually and layer by layer, without consideration of interactions. In previous studies we implemented a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach to include pedological knowledge and between-properties and between-layer interactions in the mapping process. However, it typically does not consider spatial correlation. Our goal was to extend SEM by accounting for residual spatial correlation using a geostatistical approach. We assumed second-order stationary and estimated the semivariogram parameters, together with the usual SEM parameters, using maximum likelihood estimation. Spatial prediction was done using regression kriging. The methodology is applied to mapping cation exchange capacity, clay content and soil organic carbon for three soil horizons in a 150100-km(2) study area in the Great Plains of the United States. The calibration process included all parameters used in 1avaan, a SEM software, plus two extra parameters to model residual spatial correlation. The residuals showed substantial spatial correlation, which indicates that including spatial correlation yields more accurate predictions. We also compared the standard SEM and the spatial SEM approaches in terms of SEM model coefficients. Differences were substantial but none of the coefficients changed sign. Presence of residual spatial correlation suggests that some of the causal factors that explain soil variation were not captured by the set of covariates. Thus, it is worthwhile to search for additional covariates leaving only unstructured residual noise, but provided that this is not achieved, it is beneficial to include residual spatial correlation in mapping using SEM.

Statistical inference for partially linear additive spatial autoregressive models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.04.008,JUN 2018,38,0,"In this paper, a class of partially linear additive spatial autoregressive models (PLASARM) is studied. With the nonparametric functions approximated by basis functions, we propose a generalized method of moments estimator for PLASARM. Under mild conditions, we obtain the asymptotic normality for the finite parametric vector and the optimal convergence rate for nonparametric functions. In order to make statistical inference for parametric component, we propose the estimator for asymptotic covariance matrix of the parameter estimator and establish the asymptotic properties for the resulting estimators. Finite sample performance of the proposed method is assessed by Monte Carlo simulation studies, and the developed methodology is illustrated by an analysis of the Boston housing price data.

On the relationship between conditional (CAR) and simultaneous (SAR) autoregressive models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.04.006,JUN 2018,57,0,"We clarify relationships between conditional (CAR) and simultaneous (SAR) autoregressive models. We review the literature on this topic and find that it is mostly incomplete. Our main result is that a SAR model can be written as a unique CAR model, and while a CAR model can be written as a SAR model, it is not unique. In fact, we show how any multivariate Gaussian distribution on a finite set of points with a positive-definite covariance matrix can be written as either a CAR or a SAR model. We illustrate how to obtain any number of SAR covariance matrices from a single CAR covariance matrix by using Givens rotation matrices on a simulated example. We also discuss sparseness in the original CAR construction, and for the resulting SAR weights matrix. For a real example, we use crime data in 49 neighborhoods from Columbus, Ohio, and show that a geostatistical model optimizes the likelihood much better than typical first-order CAR models. We then use the implied weights from the geostatistical model to estimate CAR model parameters that provides the best overall optimization.

Geographical differences in blood potassium detected using a structured additive distributional regression model,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.03.001,APR 2018,23,0,"Recently, physicians in an area of northwestern Spain became concerned about the large number of patients whose serum potassium concentrations were above the normal range, as well as differences in the values recorded from one area to another. With the aim of identifying geographical differences in both mean and variability of potassium levels, analyses were performed using modern flexible regression techniques based on a structured additive distributional regression model. In this type of model, every parameter of a response distribution - rather than just the mean - is related to a structured additive predictor. After adjusting for variables such as age, sex, clot-contact time and spatial effects, differences in potassium concentrations were confirmed. The type of distributional regression model used permitted the mean and variance of the potassium concentrations to be modelled using additive predictors that allow for different types of covariate effects. A variety of complex distributions were contemplated.

In general, higher concentrations and greater variability were recorded in areas further from the hospital laboratory responsible for the analyses, although some that were nearby also returned high values. Further actions are required to confirm whether these differences reflect reality or non-optimum pre-analytical handling (resulting in pseudohyperkalaemia) in certain districts.

Modelling Spatial Compositional Data: Reconstructions of past land cover and uncertainties,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.03.005,APR 2018,45,0,"In this paper we construct a hierarchical model for spatial compositional data which is used to reconstruct past land-cover compositions (in terms of coniferous forest, broadleaved forest, and unforested/open land) for five time periods during the past 6000 years over Europe. The model consists of a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) with Dirichlet observations. A block updated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), including an adaptive Metropolis adjusted Langevin step, is used to estimate model parameters. The sparse precision matrix in the GMRF provides computational advantages leading to a fast MCMC algorithm. Reconstructions are obtained by combining pollen-based estimates of vegetation cover at a limited number of locations with scenarios of past deforestation and output from a dynamic vegetation model. To evaluate uncertainties in the predictions a novel way of constructing joint confidence regions for the entire composition at each prediction location is proposed. The hierarchical model's ability to reconstruct past land cover is evaluated through cross validation for all time periods, and by comparing reconstructions for the recent past to a present day European forest map. The evaluation results are promising, and the model is able to capture known structures in past land-cover compositions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Fast and scalable variational Bayes estimation of spatial econometric models for Gaussian data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.03.002,APR 2018,42,0,"Spatial econometric models have been widely used for analyzing cross-sectional data in which spatial dependence is of primary interest. Although proven successful, Bayesian estimation via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for spatial econometric models can be computationally demanding as the size of data and complexity of models grow. This paper proposes two variational Bayes methods that are more scalable and computationally faster in estimating general spatial autoregressive and matrix exponential spatial specification models: the hybrid mean-field variational Bayes (MFVB) method and the integrated nonfactorized variational Bayes (INFVB) method. The hybrid MFVB method assumes posterior independence and, when applicable, can yield accurate results but tends to underestimate posterior variances. In comparison, the INFVB method provides more robust results by accounting for posterior dependence and is computationally appealing due to parallelization. We demonstrate that variational Bayesian inference can be a faster and more scalable alternative to the MCMC approach for Bayesian spatial econometric modeling.

On the formal specification of sum-zero constrained intrinsic conditional autoregressive models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.03.007,APR 2018,33,0,"We propose a formal specification for sum-zero constrained intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) models. Our specification first projects a vector of proper conditional autoregressive spatial random effects onto a subspace where the projected vector is constrained to sum to zero, and after that takes the limit when the proper conditional autoregressive model approaches the ICAR model. As a result, we show that the sum-zero constrained ICAR model has a singular Gaussian distribution with zero mean vector and a unique covariance matrix. Previously, sum-zero constraints have typically been imposed on the vector of spatial random effects in ICAR models within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in what is known as centering-on-the-fly. This mathematically informal way to impose the sum-zero constraint obscures the actual joint density of the spatial random effects. By contrast, the present work elucidates a unique distribution for ICAR random effects. The explicit expressions for the resulting unique covariance matrix and density function are useful for the development of Bayesian methodology in spatial statistics which will be useful to practitioners. We illustrate the practical relevance of our results by using Bayesian model selection to jointly assess both spatial dependence and fixed effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Generalized spatial fusion model framework for joint analysis of point and areal data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.11.006,MAR 2018,42,0,"The availability of geo-referenced data increased dramatically in recent years, motivating the use of spatial statistics in a variety of research fields, including epidemiology, environmental science, remote sensing, and economics. Combining data measured at both point and areal support can improve parameter estimation and increase prediction accuracy. We propose a new generalized spatial fusion model framework for jointly analyzing point and areal data. Assuming a common latent spatial process, we take a Bayesian hierarchical approach to model both types of data without distributional constraints. The models are implemented with nearest neighbor Gaussian process in Stan modeling language to increase computational efficiency and flexibility. Our simulation study shows that generalized fusion models under this framework model the latent process better than spatial process models. We identify scenarios where fusion models can offer large improvements. We then apply the framework to epidemiological data to identify the spatial risk pattern of respiratory diseases and lung cancer in Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. (c) 2017 The Authors.

Distance function modeling in optimally locating additional boreholes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.11.001,MAR 2018,61,0,"The optimal locating of additional boreholes is complicated and very time consuming. Some methods such as metaheuristic algorithms, calculation parallelism, and reducing the time of objective function calculation could be used to increase the calculation speed; among these methods, the latter is preferred due to its extensive influence on the optimization of time. The main reasons that make the objective function calculation cumbersome are mentioned hereafter, and according to their priority: (1) excessive quantity of blocks in the geological block model, and (2) inverting the matrix of average semivariogram between samples is a time consuming operation. The present study aims to decrease the calculation time by reducing the number of blocks without considering their size increment that affects accuracy. To achieve this purpose, the objective function is calculated according to the block model of uncertainty zone, which is defined by using the recently introduced distance function to investigate uncertainty in mineralized domain boundaries. In order to evaluate the performance of the present approach on reducing the calculation time as well as the precision in locating additional boreholes, the results from particle swarm optimization as a metaheuristic algorithm are compared by considering two different scenarios of combined variance reduction on the basis of a three-dimensional geological block model and an uncertainty block model. The comparative results show that using the uncertainty block model reduces the calculation time by one-third, and the proposed locations of the boreholes are more consistent to the study's aim, which is to reduce the boundary's uncertainty.

A hierarchically adaptable spatial regression model to link aggregated health data and environmental data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.11.002,MAR 2018,59,0,"Health data and environmental data are commonly collected at different levels of aggregation. A persistent challenge of using a spatial regression model to link these data is that their associations can vary as a function of aggregation. This results into ecological fallacy if association at one aggregation level is used for inferencing at another level. We address this challenge by presenting a hierarchically adaptable spatial regression model. In essence, the model extends the spatially varying coefficient model to allow the response to be count data at larger aggregation levels than that of the covariates. A Bayesian hierarchical approach is used for inferencing the model parameters. Robust inference and optimal prediction over geographical space and at different spatial aggregation levels are studied by simulated data sets. The spatial associations at different spatial supports are largely different, but can be efficiently inferred when prior knowledge of the associations is available. The model is applied to study hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Da Nang city, Viet Nam. Decrease in vegetated areas corresponds with elevated HFMD risks. A study to the identifiability of the parameters shows a strong need for a highly informative prior distribution. We conclude that the model is robust to the underlying aggregation levels of the calibrating data for association inference and it is ready for application in health geography. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Correcting for spatial heterogeneity in plant breeding experiments with P-splines,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.10.003,MAR 2018,42,1,"An important aim of the analysis of agricultural field experiments is to obtain good predictions for genotypic performance, by correcting for spatial effects. In practice these corrections turn out to be complicated, since there can be different types of spatial effects; those due to management interventions applied to the field plots and those due to various kinds of erratic spatial trends. This paper explores the use of two-dimensional smooth surfaces to model random spatial variation. We propose the use of anisotropic tensor product P-splines to explicitly model large-scale (global trend) and small-scale (local trend) spatial dependence. On top of this spatial field, effects of genotypes, blocks, replicates, and/ or other sources of spatial variation are described by a mixed model in a standard way. Each component in the model is shown to have an effective dimension. They are closely related to variance estimation, and helpful for characterising the importance of model components. An important result of this paper is the formal proof of the relation between several definitions of heritability and the effective dimension associated with the genetic component. The practical value of our approach is illustrated by simulations and analyses of large-scale plant breeding experiments. An R-package, SpATS, is provided. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Disaggregating statistical data at the field level: An entropy approach,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.11.005,MAR 2018,43,0,"This paper provides an alternative approach to disaggregating agricultural data concerning land-use at the detailed pixel level. The proposed approach combines several techniques, such as Hj-Biplot, cluster analysis, dasymetric mapping and cross-entropy, and it is implemented in two steps. First, prior information is estimated based on the application of a HJ-Biplot and cluster analysis and using a dasymetric mapping methodology. Then, the estimated prior information is used in a cross-entropy model to disaggregate data at the pixel level in a context of incomplete information. This approach is applied to the Algarve region in southern Portugal. The results show a significant correlation between observed and estimated land-uses and are relevant in terms of information gains. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Geostatistical estimation and prediction for censored responses,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.12.001,MAR 2018,34,0,"Spatially-referenced geostatistical responses that are collected in environmental sciences research are often subject to detection limits, where the measures are not fully quantifiable. This leads to censoring (left, right, interval, etc.), and various ad hoc statistical methods (such as choosing arbitrary detection limits, or data augmentation) are routinely employed during subsequent statistical analysis for inference and prediction. However, inference may be imprecise and sensitive to the assumptions and approximations involved in those arbitrary choices. To circumvent this, we propose an exact maximum likelihood estimation framework of the fixed effects and variance components and related prediction via a novel application of the Stochastic Approximation of the Expectation Maximization (SAEM) algorithm, allowing for easy and elegant estimation of model parameters under censoring. Both simulation studies and application to a real dataset on arsenic concentration collected by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality demonstrate the advantages of our method over the available naive techniques in terms of finite sample properties of the estimates, prediction, and robustness. The proposed methods can be implemented using the R package CensSpatial. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Clustering of concurrent flood risks via Hazard Scenarios,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.12.002,MAR 2018,44,0,"The study of multiple effects of a number of variables, and the assessment of the corresponding environmental risks, may require the adoption of suitable multivariate models when the variables at play are dependent, as it often happens in environmental studies. In this work, the flood risks in a given region are investigated, in order to identify specific spatial sub-regions (clusters) where the floods show a similar behavior with respect to suitable (multivariate) criteria. The reason of the work is three-fold, and the outcomes have deep implications in the hydrological practice: (i) such a regionalization (as it is called in hydrology) may provide useful indications for deciding which gauge stations have a similar (stochastic) behavior; (ii) the spatial clustering may represent a valuable tool for investigating ungauged basins present in a given ""homogeneous"" Region; (iii) the estimate of extreme design values may be improved by using all the observations collected in a cluster (instead of only single-station data). For this purpose, a Copula-based Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithm - a key tool in geosciences for the analysis of the dependence information - is proposed. The procedure is illustrated via a case study involving the Po river basin, the largest Italian one. A comparison with a previous attempt to cluster the gauge stations present in the same spatial region is also carried out. The sub-regions picked out by the clustering procedure outlined here agree with previous results obtained via heuristic hydrological and meteorological reasonings, and identify spatial areas characterized by similar flood regimes.

Comparison of statistical methods for testing the hypothesis of constant global mean in spatial statistics,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.01.001,MAR 2018,36,0,"In spatial statistics in general, and in geostatistics in particular, the choice between a spatial model with drift and a model with constant global mean is often critical, especially when only a small number of samples are available. A statistical test provides an objective means of making this choice. Among the many available statistical tests, a variance-ratio test has been widely used for making this choice because of its good statistical properties but, in addition to a semi-variogram model, it also requires an alternative drift model hypothesis. Another test statistic is the global D-statistic, which is a complementary test in the sense that it does not require an alternative hypothesis model. In this paper, we use sparse data from simulated random fields to evaluate and compare the performances of these two methods for testing the hypothesis of constant global mean in spatial statistics. We do so by considering the influence of four factors: the amount of data, the type of random field, the amount of spatial or temporal correlation and parametric drifts. In addition, we evaluate their performances in time series analysis, in which testing the hypothesis of constant global mean is also of significant interest. The two test statistics are compared in terms of their achieved confidence level and achieved power. The better method is the one that achieves the nominal confidence level and has higher power. We discuss departures from the nominal values and the results are used to highlight the importance of this problem in spatial statistics. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Improved latent space approach for modelling non-stationary spatial-temporal random fields,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.01.003,MAR 2018,40,0,"This paper proposes an improved latent space approach for modelling non-stationary spatial and spatial-temporal random fields. For the non-stationary spatial random fields, the paper proposes a general formulation of the spatial covariance. Building on the latent space approach, the proposed formulation considers regressors as latent dimensions, and characterizes the non-stationarity in the spatial covariance using a regressor-based standard deviation and correlation. For the non-stationary spatial-temporal random fields, the paper proposes general formulations for the spatial-temporal covariance structure used in a dynamic approach.

The proposed formulations are more flexible than the current ones by considering the possible effects of spatial distance, time, and regressors on the statistics of a random field. Two examples are considered in the paper. The first one considers the modelling and prediction of a spatial random field and the second one considers a spatial-temporal random field. The proposed formulations demonstrate better performance for both examples compared with the current formulations, and can better describe the dependencies of the quantities of interest on the regressors.

Measuring the spatial balance of a sample: A new measure based on Moran's I index,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2018.02.001,MAR 2018,13,0,"Measuring the degree of spatial spreading of a sample can be of great interest when sampling from a spatial population. The commonly used spatial balance index by Grafstrom et al. (2012) is particularly effective in comparing the level of spatial spreading of different samples from the same population. However, its unbounded and uninterpretable scale of measurement does not allow to assess the level of spatial spreading in absolute terms and confines its use to only raw comparisons. In this paper, we introduce a new absolute measure of the spatial spreading of a sample using a normalized version of Moran's I index. The properties and behaviour of the proposed measure are analysed through two simulation experiments, one based on three artificial populations and the other on a population of real business units located in the province of Siena (Italy).

An image quality index based on coefficients of spatial association with an application to image fusion,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.11.003,MAR 2018,46,0,"In the last decade, image quality indices have received considerable attention to quantify the dissimilarity between two images. The codispersion coefficient, commonly used in spatial statistics to address the association between two processes has also been used for this aim. Here we introduce an image quality index (CQ(max)) that is based on codispersion. This new coefficient is a directional evaluation of the spatial association, and consists of computing the maximum codispersion for a finite set of spatial lags on the plane, which also allows to obtain the direction associated with the maximum codispersion. From the CQ(max) index, a pseudo-metric that can be used as a cost functional for related optimization problems is defined. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations to explore the performance of the proposed index and its capability to detect directional contaminations. Additionally, we introduce a novel algorithm to restore directionally contaminated images and present an application with real data in the context of image fusion. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Estimating the intensity function of spatial point processes outside the observation window,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.07.008,NOV 2017,20,1,"Mapping the intensity of objects, as animal or plant species in ecological studies, is cumbersome as soon as these objects are not accessible by automated methods. The knowledge at large scale of the underlying process variability can then only be obtained through sampling and spatial prediction. Here, we aim to predict the intensity of a point process, at locations where it has not been observed, conditional to the observation using the best linear unbiased combination of the point process realization in the observation window. We show that the weight function associated to the predictor is the solution of a Fredholm equation of second kind. Both the kernel and the source term of the Fredholm equation are related to the second-order characteristics of the point process through the pair correlation function. We propose here several approximations to solve the Fredholm equation in order to obtain practical solutions and restrict the solution space to that generated by linear combinations of (i) step functions, which lead to a direct solution and (ii) elementary functions of a finite element basis, which provide a continuous approximation. Results are illustrated on simulations and to predict the intensity of Black Locust in a region of France. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A nonparametric test for the comparison of first-order structures of spatial point processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.02.007,NOV 2017,31,1,"Comparing the spatial distribution of two spatial point patterns is an important issue in many scientific areas such as ecology, epidemiology or environmental risk assessment. However, up to date, the analysis of multitype point processes has been mainly focused on searching for interactions between events of different patterns, i.e. on the second-order structure, while the first-order structure has received less attention. This work proposes testing the similarity between two spatial point patterns through the comparison of their densities of event locations. For this purpose, we consider the usual squared discrepancy measure to propose a nonparametric statistical test. The asymptotic normal distribution of the associated statistic provides a calibration procedure. The simulation study conducted to analyze the performance of the test shows that this calibration can be too conservative and supports the use of a proposed bootstrap calibration.

Local composite likelihood for spatial point processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.03.001,NOV 2017,136,1,"We develop a general approach to spatial inhomogeneity in the analysis of spatial point pattern data. The ideas of local likelihood (or 'geographically weighted regression') are applied to the composite likelihoods that are commonly used for spatial point processes. For Poisson point processes, local likelihood is already known; for Gibbs point processes we develop a local version of Besag's pseudolikelihood; for Cox point processes and Neyman-Scott cluster processes we develop a local version of the Palm likelihood of Ogata and Katsura. Using recent results for composite likelihood and for spatial point processes, we develop tools for statistical inference, including intensity approximations, variance estimators, localised tests for the significance of a covariate effect, and global tests of homogeneity. Computationally efficient approximations are available using the Fast Fourier Transform. We develop methods for bandwidth selection, which may also be useful for smoothing dependent spatial data. There are mathematical connections to existing exploratory methods such as the scan statistic, local indicators of spatial association, and point process residuals. The methods are demonstrated on three example datasets, and R code is supplied. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A three-dimensional anisotropic point process characterization for pharmaceutical coatings,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.05.003,NOV 2017,38,2,"Spatial characterization and modeling of the structure of a material may provide valuable knowledge on its properties and function. Especially, for a drug formulation coated with a polymer film, understanding the relationship between pore structure and drug release properties is important to optimize the coating film design. Here, we use methods from image analysis and spatial statistics to characterize and model the pore structure in pharmaceutical coatings. More precisely, we use and develop point process theory to characterize the branching structure of a polymer blended film with data from confocal laser scanning microscopy. Point patterns, extracted by identifying branching points of pore channels, are both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. Therefore, we introduce a directional version of the inhomogeneous K-function to study the anisotropy and then suggest two alternative ways to model the anisotropic three-dimensional structure. First, we apply a linear transformation to the data such that it appears isotropic and subsequently fit isotropic inhomogeneous Strauss or Lennard-Jones models to the transformed pattern. Second, we include the anisotropy directly in a Lennard-Jones and a more flexible step-function model with anisotropic pair-potential functions. The methods presented will be useful for anisotropic inhomogeneous point patterns in general and for characterizing porous material in particular. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Space-time covariance functions based on linear response theory and the turning bands method,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.07.001,NOV 2017,39,1,"The generation of non-separable, physically motivated covariance functions is a theme of ongoing research interest, given that only a few classes of such functions are available. We construct a nonseparable space-time covariance function based on a diffusive Langevin equation. We employ ideas from statistical mechanics to express the response of an equilibrium (i.e., time independent) random field to a driving noise process by means of a linear, diffusive relaxation mechanism. The equilibrium field is assumed to follow an exponential joint probability density which is determined by a spatial local interaction model. We then use linear response theory to express the temporal evolution of the random field around the equilibrium state in terms of a Langevin equation. The latter yields an equation of motion for the space-time covariance function, which can be solved explicitly at certain limits. We use the explicit covariance model obtained in one spatial dimension and time. By means of the turning bands transform, we derive a non-separable space-time covariance function in three space dimensions and time. We investigate the mathematical properties of this spacetime covariance function, and we use it to model a dataset of daily ozone concentration values from the conterminous USA.

Convergence in distribution of the L-2-deviations of the kernel-type variogram estimators with applications,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.02.002,NOV 2017,31,1,"In this work, some properties of the L-2-deviations of the Nadaraya-Watson variogram estimators are analyzed, for both the anisotropic and the isotropic settings. Their convergence in distribution is established, which provides the basis for addressing practical problems, such as the construction of goodness of fit tests for the variogram and, therefore, for modeling the spatial dependence. However, the development of the latter application requires solving different issues, such as the approximation of the model parameters and the critical points. For estimation of the former ones, we propose proceeding through the least squares criteria, whose consistency will be proved, together with a reformulation of the global measures for the kernel-type estimators. Then, the resulting critical points can be approximated by appealing to the bootstrap approaches. Numerical studies with simulated and real data have been developed to illustrate the potentiality of our results, in order to check the appropriateness of a variogram model selected for the variogram.

Nonparametric estimation of the small-scale variability of heteroscedastic spatial processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.04.001,NOV 2017,14,1,"The current study aims to provide nonparametric estimators of the conditional variance and the dependence structure of a heteroscedastic spatial process. When assuming zero mean along the domain, the approximation of the variance can be addressed by linear smoothing of the squared observations. Then, the variogram can be estimated from the standardized data. In the presence of a non-zero deterministic trend, we suggest a modification of the latter method that involves the residuals obtained from a local linear estimation of the trend, together with corrections of the biases derived from the use of these residuals. This work includes the results of numerical studies carried out to check the performance of the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed methodology is applied to monthly precipitation data collected on the continental part of USA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Modelling spatio-temporal data with multiple seasonalities: The NO2 Portuguese case,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.04.005,NOV 2017,35,1,"This study aims at characterizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of spatio-temporal data sets, characterized by high resolution in the temporal dimension which are becoming the norm rather than the exception in many application areas, namely environmental modelling. In particular, air pollution data, such as NO2 concentration levels, often incorporate also multiple recurring patterns in time imposed by social habits, anthropogenic activities and meteorological conditions. A two-stage modelling approach is proposed which combined with a block bootstrap procedure correctly assesses uncertainty in parameters estimates and produces reliable confidence regions for the space-time phenomenon under study. The methodology provides a model that is satisfactory in terms of goodness of fit, interpretability, parsimony, prediction and forecasting capability and computational costs.

Estimating covariance functions of multivariate skew-Gaussian random fields on the sphere,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.07.009,NOV 2017,43,1,"This paper considers a multivariate spatial random field, with each component having univariate marginal distributions of the skewGaussian type. We assume that the field is defined spatially on the unit sphere embedded in R-3, allowing for modeling data available over large portions of planet Earth. This model admits explicit expressions for the marginal and cross covariances. However, the n-dimensional distributions of the field are difficult to evaluate, because it requires the sum of 2n terms involving the cumulative and probability density functions of a n-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Since in this case inference based on the full likelihood is computationally unfeasible, we propose a composite likelihood approach based on pairs of spatial observations. This last being possible thanks to the fact that we have a closed form expression for the bivariate distribution. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method through simulation experiments and the analysis of a real data set of minimum and maximum surface air temperatures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Exploring risk factors in breast cancer screening program data using structured geoadditive models with high order interaction,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.07.004,NOV 2017,14,1,"When analyzing data from cancer screening programs, flexible regression specifications are required to account for the highly complex structure in such data. We analyzed data from a breast cancer screening program conducted in central Portugal and considered an extension of structured additive regression models where, in addition to the possibility to include nonlinear and spatial effects, we can include a trivariate interaction between attendance rate, detection rate and mortality rate in the screening program. While spatial effects capture unobserved heterogeneity at the municipality level, the trivariate interaction proves important for the understanding of the complex interaction effects resulting from the diversity in municipality coverage and attendance rates. The trivariate interaction is implemented based on a Markov random field representation which enables efficient Bayesian inference and, when modeling breast cancer incidence rates, showed a significant improvement in terms of model fit when compared to a simpler geoadditive regression model.

Integrating multivariate conditionally autoregressive spatial priors into recursive bivariate models for analyzing environmental sensitivity of mussels,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.07.005,NOV 2017,55,1,"Understanding ecological interrelationships between species and their environment is an important part of biological research and in case of productive livestock also economic research. We therefore investigate how adult mussels and mussel seeds (of Mytilus galloprovincialis) interact while simultaneously accounting for environmental factors. For that purpose, we develop a recursive bivariate simultaneous equation model which considers the environmental endogeneity of the mussels. In order to address the potentially highly complex ecological patterns, we include environmental factors via integrating multivariate autoregressive discrete spatial effect priors into the framework of simultaneous equation models. This allows for general correlation structures of the spatial effects and thus avoids the restrictive (implicit) assumption that adult mussels and mussel seeds of the same species react independently to their environment.

Spatio-Temporal model structures with shared components for semi-continuous species distribution modelling,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.08.001,NOV 2017,53,2,"Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamism and environmental relationships of species is essential for the conservation of natural resources. Many spatio-temporally sampled processes result in continuous positive [0,8) abundance datasets that have many zero values observed in areas that lie outside their optimum niche. In such cases the most common option is to use two-part or hurdle models, which fit independent models and consequently independent environmental effects to occurrence and conditionalto- presence abundance. This may be correct in some cases, but not as much in others where the detection probability is related to the abundance.

The aim of this work is to infer the spatio-temporal dynamism of ecological processes and to fit more robust environmental effects in two-part models. On the one hand we propose different spatiotemporal structures to infer the fundamental spatio-temporal behaviour of the process under study. On the other hand, we propose the use of shared component modelling (SCM) to estimate more robust model effects in related semi-continuous datasets by combining information from occurrence and conditional-to-presence abundance.

"One-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three dimensional B-splines to specify space-time interactions in Bayesian disease mapping: Model fitting and model identifiability",SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.04.002,NOV 2017,43,2,"In recent years, models incorporating splines have been considered for smoothing risks in disease mapping. Although these models are very flexible, they can be computationally demanding in certain cases. In this work, one, two, and three-dimensional B-splines (penalized or unpenalized) are considered to model space-time interactions. Model identifiability issues are discussed and appropriate constraints are clearly established. As computing time could be a limitation in real practice, integrated nested Laplace approximations are used for model fitting and inference. The complete set of proposed models are illustrated using cancer mortality data in small areas. We conclude that if the number of small areas is not big, one dimensional P-splines for the space-time interaction could be a good choice. When the number of small areas increases substantially, two-dimensional and mainly three dimensional splines are computationally better alternatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Multifractal complexity analysis in space-time based on the generalized dimensions derivatives,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.07.014,NOV 2017,24,1,"In this work, the formulation of some parametric families of complexity measures in the multifractal domain, from the scaling limiting behaviour of generalized Renyi-entropy-based 'product complexity measures', is proposed. These families are related to incremental functionals of the curve of generalized Renyi dimensions. In particular, the significance in this context of the first derivative of the generalized dimensions curve, and specifically the indicators given by its minimum value and the corresponding value of the deformation parameter, is justified. The practical usefulness of the multifractal complexity measures proposed, for characterization and assessment of structural dynamical changes in a spatiotemporal system with multifractal behaviour, is illustrated with the study of real data from a seismic series involving a central period of high activity within a regular regime.

Dealing with non-stationarity through explanatory variables in kriging-based air quality maps,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.08.003,NOV 2017,29,0,"Kriging-based estimation is used to interpolate air quality data on large scale regular grids from observations at monitoring sites. However, the sources of pollution and therefore the data typology are highly variable (rural background, urban and suburban background, traffic-related pollution), invalidating the assumption of stationarity. On a large scale (regional, national, continental), the site typology can be described by an auxiliary variable, typically the pollutant emission in a fixed radius around the site. In particular the quantity of NOx emissions, introduced in the kriging as external drift, is a useful variable to account for human activity and related pollution in urban areas. In this paper a new formulation of this question was examined by introducing a new space 2D x V where nu is an element of V is the explanatory variable of the concentration. The way of computing with two different options. First, after rescaling the third dimension to R-2, the classic Euclidean distance is used in the newly built space through a metric variogram. Secondly, both the Euclidean distance in the 2D space and the absolute deviation in. are used within a productsum model to deal with the underlying complex anisotropy. The results obtained by ordinary kriging with metric or product-sum variogram in the composite space are compared to ordinary kriging and kriging with. as external drift using a purely spatial variogram. The use of Chemistry-Transport Models (CTM) is also considered as a potential improvement is also approached and the way of introducing this type of data in the kriging is discussed. Finally, in the light of the results provided by this set of estimators applied to NO2 datasets, kriging with external drift in the 2D space remains the most convenient way on average to deal with non-stationarity and to include all the explanatory informations in the estimator.

MCMC Bayesian spatial filtering for hedonic models in real estate markets,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.07.010,NOV 2017,40,0,"The traditional hedonic model postulates that housing prices depend on their characteristics and their location. However, this model assumes a constant relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. This assumption is unrealistic because empirical studies have shown that the regression coefficients depend on the housing location. For this reason, it is necessary to use models with spatially varying coefficients. The approaches proposed in the literature used to estimate this type of models do not incorporate the uncertainty associated with the estimation and selection of models and/or are computationally expensive. To improve these aspects, this paper proposes spatial filtering techniques to parsimoniously model the spatial dependencies of the hedonic coefficients and an adaptive MCMC Bayesian algorithm to select the most appropriate filters. The method is illustrated through an application to the real estate market of Zaragoza, and a comparison with alternative procedures is conducted. Our results show that our valuation methodology has better goodness of fit and predictive performance properties than alternative methods. Although our proposal assumes normality and homoscedasticity of the model error distribution, the method is easy to implement and not very computationally demanding, which makes this approach attractive and useful from a practical viewpoint.

Spatial subsemble estimator for large geostatistical data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.08.004,NOV 2017,36,0,"We introduce the concept of spatial subsemble, a subset ensemble estimation method useful in the analysis of large spatial random field datasets. The full dataset is sampled to give small spatially structured subsets of observations whose parameters are easily estimated; these are combined using a weighting scheme based on their cross-validation prediction ability. We show that our estimator is consistent. More importantly, we compare the spatial subsemble with competing alternatives and show that our proposed procedure is both accurate and much faster than its competitor. We illustrate the use of our method using several examples from large datasets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Prediction and model comparison for areal unit data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.09.002,NOV 2017,43,0,"Areal unit or discrete spatial data is customarily modeled with the goal of spatial smoothing, typically using Markov random field models. Examples include image restoration and disease mapping. Here, wefocus on a different issue for such data; weconsider the set of areal units as only partially observed. One application is to learn about the smoothing behavior of various Markov random field models. That is, if two different smoothing priors are used, how can we quantify the relative smoothing that each imposes? Wepropose to fit models of interest to a portion of the data and hold out the rest for model comparison. A second application concerns the setting where, in fact, only a portion of the areal units have been observed, and we seek prediction of the remainder. Our motivating context investigates the performance of semiconductor chips, created as dies (the areal units) within wafers within lots, yielding nested modeling structure. Multiple tests are administered to each die involving both binary and continuous measurements. In practice, only a small subset of the dies are sampled, resulting in prediction of performance for the remaining unsampled dies. Furthermore, dies in the same locations are tested on each wafer, and the manufacturing process encourages within wafer, between wafer and between lot dependence. Other missing data applications include damaged images and small area estimation with missing observations for some units. We demonstrate prediction first with an image that is observed at several rates of missingness. Then, a wellstudied Ohio lung cancer dataset is used for model comparison with regard to smoothing. Finally, examination of the nested modeling for semiconductor chip data is offered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A multi-criteria leave-two-out cross-validation procedure for max-stable process selection,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.09.004,NOV 2017,50,1,"Max-stable processes are the extension of the univariate extreme value theory to the spatial case. Contrary to the univariate case, there is no unique parametric form for the limiting distribution in the spatial case, and several max-stable processes can be found in the literature. Selecting the best of them for the data under study is still an open question. This paper proposes a procedure for discriminating max-stable processes by focusing on their spatial dependence structure. Specifically, it combines a leave-two-out cross-validation scheme and a large panel of adapted criteria. We compare five of the most commonly used max-stable processes, using as a case study a large data set of winter maxima of 3-day precipitation amounts in the French Alps (90 stations from 1958 to 2012). All the introduced criteria show that the extremal-t, geometric Gaussian and Brown-Resnick processes are equally able to represent the structure of dependence of the data, regardless of the number of stations or years. Although these results have to be confirmed by replicating the study in other contexts, they may be valid for a wide range of environmental applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Second-order analysis of point patterns on a network using any distance metric,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.10.002,NOV 2017,45,0,"The analysis of clustering and correlation between points on a linear network, such as traffic accident locations on a street network, depends crucially on how we measure the distance between points. Standard practice is to measure distance by the length of the shortest path. However, this may be inappropriate and even fallacious in some applications. Alternative distance metrics include Euclidean, least-cost, and resistance distances. This paper develops a general framework for the second-order analysis of point patterns on a linear network, using a broad class of distance metrics on the network. We examine the model assumptions that are implicit in choosing a particular distance metric; define appropriate analogues of the K-function and pair correlation function; develop estimators of these characteristics; and study their statistical performance. The methods are tested on several datasets, including a demonstration that different conclusions can be reached using different choices of metric. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Some robustness assessments of Moran eigenvector spatial filtering,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.09.001,NOV 2017,41,2,"Moran eigenvector spatial filtering (MESF) is a novel methodology in the spatially varying coefficients tradition promoted in spatial statistics, quantitative geography, and statistical ecology that deals with spatial autocorrelation in georeferenced data. Its Moran Coefficient based estimators exhibit statistical properties of unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency. Evidence is accumulating that it also exhibits robustness, or good performance with georeferenced data drawn from not only normal, but also at least Poisson and binomial, probability distributions. This paper further explores this performance. In doing so, it addresses the sensitivity of MESF results to changing: (1) the employed spatial weights matrix specification for constructing MESF synthetic variates, in space, space-time, and spatial flows network structures; (2) the design of Monte Carlo simulation experiments; (3) cross-validation type imputation estimators; (4) the nature of embedded geographical dependence to include negative spatial autocorrelation (SA) components; and, (5) the SA index (e.g., the Geary Ratio) basis of eigenvector spatial filter (ESF) estimators.

Factor copula models for data with spatio-temporal dependence,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.10.001,NOV 2017,24,2,"We propose a new copula model for spatial data that are observed repeatedly in time. The model is based on the assumption that there exists a common factor that affects the measurements of a process in space and in time. Unlike models based on multivariate normality, our model can handle data with tail dependence and asymmetry. The likelihood for the proposed model can be obtained in a simple form and therefore parameter estimation is quite fast. Simulation from this model is straightforward and data can be predicted at any spatial location and time point. We use simulation studies to show different types of dependencies, both in space and in time, that can be generated by this model. We apply the proposed copula model to hourly wind data and compare its performance with some classical models for spatio-temporal data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Accounting for covariate information in the scale component of spatio-temporal mixing models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.09.003,NOV 2017,21,0,"Spatio-temporal processes in the environmental science are usually assumed to follow a Gaussian process, possibly after some transformation. Gaussian processes might not be appropriate to handle the presence of outlying observations. Our proposal is based on the idea of modelling the process as a scale mixture between a Gaussian and log-Gaussian process. And the novelty is to allow the scale process to vary as a function of covariates. The resultant model has a nonstationary covariance structure in space. Moreover, the resultant kurtosis varies with location, allowing the time series at each location to have different distributions with different tail behaviour. Inference procedure is performed under the Bayesian framework. The analysis of an artificial dataset illustrates how this proposal is able to capture heterogeneity in space caused by dependence on some spatial covariate or by a transformation of the process of interest. Furthermore, an application to maximum temperature data observed in the Spanish Basque country illustrates the effects of altitude in the variability of the process and how our proposed model identifies this dependence through parameters which can be interpreted as regression coefficients in the variance model.

"Spatial association of population pyramids across Europe: The application of symbolic data, cluster analysis and join-count tests",SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.03.003,AUG 2017,66,0,"Demographic processes across European regions show great diversity, but because of this diversity, it is hard to gain an overview of similarities and differences. This paper aims to examine the application of a new combination of existing approaches to the analysis of regional population pyramids to offer such an overview. Symbolic data analysis and cluster analysis are used to identify typical shapes of population pyramids, before applying join-count tests to examine the spatial distribution of these pyramid shapes. The data used are for 1397 NUTS regional units in 37 European countries in 2015.

We find that Irish regions, Cyprus and some of the capital cities of Western Europe present the youngest population across Europe, while the population of Eastern Germany is the oldest and shrinking in size. Countries of East-central Europe are the most homogeneous in their demographic processes for the chosen period, while the large demographic discrepancies occur within Spain, France, the UK, Finland, and Sweden between NUTS regions. A spatial study indicated positive spatial autocorrelation, and the transnational character of demographic processes across Europe. For a detailed examination of East-central Europe, we applied local statistics, and revealed three transnational spatial clusters resulting from historical and socio-economic processes.

A geographically weighted regression model for Italy, 2001-2011",SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.03.002,AUG 2017,35,0,"The potential economic distress of households is a phenomenon bound up with a very broad set of economic, demographic and social factors. This paper is concerned with the identification of these factors and of how their spatial variability influences the spatial variability of the Share of Households in Potential Economic Distress (SHED). To this end, a model of geographically weighted regression (GWR) is calculated for the SHED observed in the 110 Italian provinces at the time of the last two censuses (2001 and 2011). The results show that the SHED and its determinants present a sharply defined geographical pattern that varies over the ten-year interval. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Re-examining environmental Kuznets curve for China's city-level carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.09.005,AUG 2017,54,4,"Chinese central government promised to reduce its CO2 emissions intensity by 40%-45% by 2020 compared to the level of 2005. However, with limited knowledge on local CO2 emissions, the government could hardly decompose its mitigation plan to local administrative divisions. In this paper, we first interpolate the provincial CO2 emissions to prefectural cities with a combination of areal interpolation method and DMSP/OLS nighttime light data. Then, we test the EKC hypothesis with this city-level data and spatial econometric modeling. This research reveals an uneven landscape of CO2 emissions at both provincial and city scales, suggesting a differentiated decomposition of the mitigation target in China. The city-level monotonic increasing relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita confirmed by our EKC test indicates that CO2 emissions would not decrease automatically as income increases. To that end, actions such as improving the energy efficiency and implementing carbon taxes should be taken to reduce CO2 emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A spatial analysis of new business formation: Replicative vs innovative behaviour,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.02.004,AUG 2017,39,0,"Using spatial econometric tools, the paper examines the spatial structure of new business formation of Italian regions during the period 2004-2007. In particular, the study empirically investigates whether new business formation in a given geographical area may be explained in terms of replicative and/or innovative entrepreneurial behaviour in each area as well as in the neighbouring areas. Additionally, the analysis focuses on the influence of urbanization on the birth of new firms. From the estimation of a Spatial Durbin Model, we find a significant degree of spatial dependence among Italian regions not only in new business formation but also in some of its determinants. We also find that new business formation in Italy can be explained in terms of both replicative and innovative entrepreneurial behaviour, whose effects depend strictly on the degree of urbanization. Specifically, the replicative behaviour of new firms seems to be significantly dependent on the degree of urbanization, i.e. we find positive effects only when regions are lowly urbanized. A similar result is not found for the innovative behaviour, which positively influences new business formation independently on the degree of urbanization. However, when regions are lowly urbanized, some obstacles to new business of innovative nature can be observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the inconsistent relationships between socioeconomic factors and poverty incidence across contiguous poverty-stricken regions in China: Multilevel modelling,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.02.009,AUG 2017,47,2,"Understanding discrepancies in the effects of various socioeconomic predictors of poverty incidence across different contiguous poverty-stricken regions can provide new information for Chinese policymakers. However, no comprehensive statistical analysis exists. In this paper, we apply a multilevel model, together with systematic and high-quality poverty incidence data from China's 13 poverty-stricken regions in 2013, to explore spatial patterns in county-level poverty incidence and to estimate the effects of seven selected socioeconomic predictors of poverty incidence. Our results showed that rural income, urbanization, education (gross enrolment ratio of senior high school students), grain production and irrigated land ratio had a significantly negative association with poverty incidence. Nevertheless, in different regions, some predictors had larger effects on poverty incidence than others. Targeted region-specific poverty-alleviation policies based on these findings could effectively support on-going poverty reduction efforts in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A likelihood-based spatial statistical transformation model (LBSSTM) of regional economic development using DMSP/OLS time-series nighttime light imagery,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.03.004,AUG 2017,55,1,"In a regional economy, the central city of a metropolitan area has a radiative effect and an accumulative effect on its surrounding cities. Considering the limitations of traditional data sources (e.g., its subjectivity) and the advantages of nighttime light data, including its objectivity, availability and cyclicity, this paper proposes a likelihood spatial statistical transformation model (LBSSTM) to invert for the gross domestic product (GDP) of the surrounding cities, using time series of Sum of Lights (SOL) data covering the central city and taking advantage of the economic and spatial association between the central city and the surrounding cities within a metropolitan area and the correlation between SOL and GDP. The Wuhan Metropolitan Area is chosen to verify the model using time series analysis and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed LBSSTM. The prediction accuracy of our model is verified by cross-validation using data from 1998, 2004 and 2011, based on the 3 sigma rule. This model can quantitatively express the agglomeration and diffusion effect of the central city and reveal the spatial pattern of this effect. The results of this work are potentially useful in making spatiotemporal economic projections and filling in missing data from some regions, as well as gaining a deeper quantitative and spatio-temporal understanding of the laws underlying regional economic development.

A comparison of estimation methods for multilevel models of spatially structured data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.01.002,AUG 2017,54,0,"Two recent contributions (Dong et al., 2015; Osland et al., 2016) point to the relevance of multilevel models for spatially structured data. In Osland et al. (2016) these models are used to examine the importance of district-level covariates for house prices in Stavanger, Norway, in Dong et al. (2015) similarly for land parcel prices in Beijing; we use these data sets in our comparison. In Osland et al. (2016), a district-level spatial random effect was fitted using an intrinsic CAR model estimated using WinBUGS. Dong et al. (2015) used R code provided in supplementary materials to their article, and subsequently improved in an R package (Dong et al., 2016a); computation there used custom MCMC C++ code to fit a SAR district-level spatial random effect. This article compares approaches to estimating models of this kind, using the R packages R2WinBUGS, HSAR, INLA, R2BayesX, hglm and the new package mclcar for Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation (Sha, 2016b). We show that multilevel models of spatially structured data may be estimated readily using a variety of approaches, not only the intrinsic CAR model more typically found in the existing literature. We also point to a range of issues for further research in situations in which data acquired at different levels of spatial resolution are combined. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Space-time variability analysis of poverty alleviation performance in China's poverty-stricken areas,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.02.010,AUG 2017,28,2,"China has achieved significant achievements in poverty reduction since the launch of its reform and opening policy in 1978. The rural poor population decreased by nearly 67 million from 2010 to 2012. Analysing and understanding the spatio-temporal variation of poverty alleviation performance in contiguous poverty-stricken regions can provide a reference for Chinese policymakers. In this paper, based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we build an evaluation index system of poverty alleviation performance and then establish a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to explore the space-time variability of poverty alleviation performance in poor areas. The spatial distribution indicates the eastern region's higher performance in poverty alleviation compared to the western region. The spatial-temporal feature shows that the increasing trend of poverty alleviation performance presents a pattern of ""high in the central, low in the east-west'' and most poor counties' development of poverty alleviation performance are consistent with overall trend. These findings suggest that the government could pay more attention to the development in the western region and vigorously carry out precise poverty alleviation measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

An evaluation of China's urban agglomeration development from the spatial perspective,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.02.008,AUG 2017,51,0,"While Chinese governments used UAs (urban agglomerations) as a policy tool to gain an advantageous position in global and regional competition and made ambitious plans to build up dozens of national, regional and local-level UAs in the next decade, the criteria of UAs from the spatial perspective have been overlooked thus far, and the proposed UAs have been defined approximately by the authority of jurisdiction of clustered cities and towns. This paper argues that rational spatial planning of UAs is impossible without consistent criteria for them and that a solid method is necessary to identify the spatial extension of UAs. Based on the theory of economic geography that views UA as a phase expression of the mature 'pole-axis' urban system, a stepwise approach is proposed: firstly, to identify central cities in a region; secondly, to assess the completeness of the city system and analyse the social and economic relationship of the cities and towns; and thirdly, to evaluate the degree of evolution of the urban system. With this approach being applied to five national-level UAs proposed by the national plan, the paper proves that the number and extension of UAs are greatly exaggerated in the current strategic plan.

Bootstrap based uncertainty bands for prediction in functional kriging,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.06.005,AUG 2017,39,0,"The increasing interest in spatially correlated functional data has led to the development of appropriate geostatistical techniques that allow to predict a curve at an unmonitored location using a functional kriging with external drift model that takes into account the effect of exogenous variables (either scalar or functional). Nevertheless uncertainty evaluation for functional spatial prediction remains an open issue. We propose a semi-parametric bootstrap for spatially correlated functional data that allows to evaluate the uncertainty of a predicted curve, ensuring that the spatial dependence structure is maintained in the bootstrap samples. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed via a simulation study. Moreover, the approach is illustrated on a well known data set of Canadian temperature and on a real data set of PM10 concentration in the Piemonte region, Italy.

Geographically Weighted Beta Regression,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.07.011,AUG 2017,30,1,"Linear regression models are often used to describe the relationship between a dependent variable and a set of independent variables. However, these models are based on the assumption that the error (or, in some cases, the response variable) is normally distributed with constant variance and that the relations are equal throughout space. Thus, these models may not be the most appropriate to adjust spatially varying rates and proportions. The Beta Regression model deals with rates and proportions and has been shown to be a good approach to model this type of data, since it naturally adapts to variables constrained to an interval of the real line and exhibiting heteroscedasticity, which is a common characteristic in this type of data. In addition, to deal with spatial non-stationarity, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) allows for variability in the parameters by an extension of the linear regression model, providing a better understanding of the spatial phenomenon. Therefore, we propose the Geographically Weighted Beta Regression (GWBR) model which combines the features of the above models such that a better fit is provided in the study of spatially varying continuous variables restricted to an interval of the real line. We applied this model to analyze the proportion of households that have telephones in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The results were more appropriate than those obtained by the global models and the Geographically Weighted Regression model, following statistics such as AICc, pseudo-R-2, log-likelihood and by the reduction of spatial dependence computed by Moran's I.

Efficiently estimating some common geostatistical models by 'energy-variance matching' or its randomized 'conditional-mean' versions,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.01.001,AUG 2017,37,0,"We consider the problem of fitting an isotropic zero-mean stationary Gaussian field model to (possibly noisy) observations, when the model belongs to the Matern family with known regularity index nu > 0, or to the spherical family. For estimating the correlation range (also called ""decorrelation length'') and the variance of the field, two simple estimating functions based on the so-called ""conditional Gaussian Gibbs-energy mean'' (CGEM) and the empirical variance (EV) were recently introduced. This article presents an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study for problems with around a thousand observations and settings including large, moderate, and even ""small'', correlation ranges. The known observation sites are either on a 2D grid (including a case of ""very non-uniform'' grid spacings) or randomly uniformly distributed on a simple 2D region. Some experiments for a 256x256 grid with missing values are also analyzed.

This study empirically demonstrates that, for all the (possibly random) uniform designs, the statistical efficiency of CGEM-EV compared to exact maximum likelihood (ML) is globally very satisfactory (except a degradation for the very extremal ranges in some contexts) provided the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is strong enough and. is not too large, this SNR restriction being alleviated as. decreases. For the ""very non-uniform'' design, a simple weighting of EV restores this efficiency. In the less favorable cases, the statistical loss remains in fact acceptable: e.g. for the largest considered index (nu = 3/2) and a ""not strong enough'' SNR, it may happen (in fact only for large ranges) that CGEM-EV almost doubles the mean squared error for the range parameter or for the widely used combination of the two parameters known as microergodic-parameter. Furthermore an important conclusion for computational efficiency is that the use of the natural fast randomized-trace version of CGEM-EV does not significantly degrade this statistical efficiency.

Multivariate bias adjusted tapered predictive process models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.04.008,AUG 2017,33,0,"We extend prior work on multivariate ""low-rank'' methods for the analysis of large multivariate spatial datasets. ""Low-rank'' methods usually operate on lower-dimensional subspaces and induce biases in the residual variance component as a result of over-smoothing or model mis-specification. Our current work attempts to characterize these biases, demonstrates their presence as a systemic phenomena, and explores remedial models without incurring computational costs. Our methodological contribution lies in the development of the multivariate tapered predictive process model that accounts for spatial correlations among multivariate components by the recently proposed multivariate matern correlation kernel. Both the proposed framework and the multivariate tapered predictive process model using linear model co-regionalization (LMC) (Sang et al., 2011) have been found to rectify bias in parameter estimation. We also prove novel theoretical results comparing smoothness properties of multivariate tapered predictive process models and classes of low rank models, including predictive processes. Finally, we illustrate our work using synthetic experiments as well as an application to forestry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The underlying idea of this algorithm is to perform a fuzzy Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering using copula-based approach to interpret comovements of time series. This generalisation allows both to extend usual clustering methods for time series based on Pearson's correlation and to capture the uncertainty that arises assigning units to clusters. Furthermore, its flexibility permits to include directly in the algorithm the spatial information. Our approach is presented and discussed using both simulated and real data, highlighting its main advantages. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A geostatistical model for combined analysis of point-level and area-level data using INLA and SPDE,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.04.006,AUG 2017,21,3,"In this paper a Bayesian geostatistical model is presented for fusion of data obtained at point and areal resolutions. The model is fitted using the INLA and SPDE approaches. In the SPDE approach, a continuously indexed Gaussian random field is represented as a discretely indexed Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) by means of a finite basis function defined on a triangulation of the region of study. In order to allow the combination of point and areal data, a new projection matrix for mapping the GMRF from the observation locations to the triangulation nodes is proposed which takes into account the types of data to be combined. The performance of the model is examined and compared with the performance of the method RAMPS via simulation when it is fitted to (i) point, (ii) areal, and (iii) point and areal data to predict several simulated surfaces that can appear in real settings. The model is applied to predict the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, United States, during 2011.

A local-EM algorithm for spatio-temporal disease mapping with aggregated data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.05.001,AUG 2017,18,0,"Spatial data on disease incidence locations are often aggregated to regional counts to preserve privacy, and spatio-temporal modelling of such can be problematic when there are boundary changes over the study period. Here an inhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity depending on variations in population (known a priori) and a smoothly varying relative risk is estimated with a local-Expectation-Maximization (or local-EM) algorithm. Using incidence data for male bladder cancer in Nova Scotia, Canada, the question of whether the data are consistent with spatially varying but temporally constant relative risk is examined. Areas where there is evidence that relative risk is substantially greater than 1 are identified with the intention of assessing the possible presence of environmental risk factors.

This paper extends existing work by incorporating a temporally varying risk surface and an explicit data structure which contains a mixture of point locations and locations aggregated to non-nested areas. This added flexibility allows the modelling of data amalgamated from different sources and collected over many years. While local-EM leads naturally to an Expectation-Maximization Smoothing algorithm, the extension to mixtures of aggregations leads to a modified algorithm that includes an additive term at every iteration to account for observed point locations.

Spatial Bayesian hierarchical model with variable selection to fMRI data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.06.002,AUG 2017,41,0,"A spatial Bayesian hierarchical model is proposed to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging data for complex spatial and temporal structures. Several studies found that spatial dependence not only appears in signal changes but also in temporal correlations among voxels; however, current statistical approaches ignore the spatial dependence of temporal correlations, thereby keeping computational efficiency. We incorporated the spatial random effects model to simultaneously consider spatial dependence arising from both signal changes and temporal correlations. We conducted simulation studies to demonstrate that the proposed approach increases the accuracy of the detection of brain activities while remaining computationally feasible. A real event-related fMRI data is provided to further illustrate the application and usefulness of the proposed model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sequential empirical Bayes method for filtering dynamic spatiotemporal processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.06.006,AUG 2017,23,0,"We consider online prediction of a latent dynamic spatiotemporal process and estimation of the associated model parameters based on noisy data. The problem is motivated by the analysis of spatial data arriving in real-time and the current parameter estimates and predictions are updated using the new data at a fixed computational cost. Estimation and prediction is performed within an empirical Bayes framework with the aid of Markov chain Monte Carlo samples. Samples for the latent spatial field are generated using a sampling importance resampling algorithm with a skewed-normal proposal and for the temporal parameters using Gibbs sampling with their full conditionals written in terms of sufficient quantities which are updated online. The spatial range parameter is estimated by a novel online implementation of an empirical Bayes method, called herein sequential empirical Bayes method. A simulation study shows that our method gives similar results as an offline Bayesian method. We also find that the skewed-normal proposal improves over the traditional Gaussian proposal. The application of our method is demonstrated for online monitoring of radiation after the Fukushima nuclear accident. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of residential property sales using space-time point patterns,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.06.007,AUG 2017,35,1,"Customarily, for housing markets, interest focuses on selling prices of properties at locations and times. Hedonic models are employed using property-level, neighborhood-level, and economic regressors. However, in hedonic modeling the fact that the locations and times of property transactions are random is ignored. Here, we focus on explanation of the locations of transactions in space and time, viewing them as a point pattern over space and time.

Our contribution is to explain such a point pattern using suitable regressors. We examine two explanatory models, the nonhomogeneous Poisson process and the log Gaussian Cox process. We study a point pattern in the city of Zaragoza, Spain, over the years, 2006-2014. We argue for point level modeling since the process of property sales operates at that scale. We elaborate efficient computation for fitting the foregoing models to the Zaragoza data. We show how the modeling enables rich inference and extraction of novel stories for this market over this time period. In addition, we clarify the potential benefits of this modeling for brokers, buyers, and administrators. To our knowledge, this is the first application of formal space-time point pattern analysis to locations of urban real estate transactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Bridging asymptotic independence and dependence in spatial extremes using Gaussian scale mixtures,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.06.004,AUG 2017,47,1,"Gaussian scale mixtures are constructed as Gaussian processes with a random variance. They have non-Gaussian marginals and can exhibit asymptotic dependence unlike Gaussian processes, which are asymptotically independent except in the case of perfect dependence. In this paper, we study the extremal dependence properties of Gaussian scale mixtures and we unify and extend general results on their joint tail decay rates in both asymptotic dependence and independence cases. Motivated by the analysis of spatial extremes, we propose flexible yet parsimonious parametric copula models that smoothly interpolate from asymptotic dependence to independence and include the Gaussian dependence as a special case. We show how these new models can be fitted to high threshold exceedances using a censored likelihood approach, and we demonstrate that they provide valuable information about tail characteristics. In particular, by borrowing strength across locations, our parametric model-based approach can also be used to provide evidence for or against either asymptotic dependence class, hence complementing information given at an exploratory stage by the widely used nonparametric or parametric estimates of the x and (x) over bar coefficients. We demonstrate the capacity of our methodology by adequately capturing the extremal properties of wind speed data collected in the Pacific Northwest, US. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A study of variance estimation methods for systematic spatial sampling,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.06.008,AUG 2017,38,2,"An undesirable property of systematic spatial sampling is that there is no known method allowing unbiased estimation of the uncertainty of statistical estimates from these surveys. A number of alternative variance estimation methods have been tested and reported by various authors. Studies comparing these estimators are inconclusive, partly because the studies compare different sets of estimators. In this paper, three estimators recommended in recent studies are compared using a single test dataset with known properties.

The first estimator compared in this study (ST4) is based on post-stratification of the data. The second estimator (V08) is using a predetermined correction factor calculated from the spatial autocorrelation. The third estimator (MB) is a model based prediction calculated using values from the semivariogram. MB and ST4 were both found to be fairly accurate, while V08 consistently underestimated the variance in this study. V08 relies on the assumption that the autocorrelation structure in the dataset can be described using a particular exponential function. The most likely explanation of the weak result for V08 is that this assumption is violated by the empirical data used in the experiment. A better correction factor can be calculated, but the safe approach is to use MB or ST4. (C) 2017 The Author.

Introducing bootstrap methods to investigate coefficient non-stationarity in spatial regression models,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.07.006,AUG 2017,59,2,"In this simulation study, parametric bootstrap methods are introduced to test for spatial non-stationarity in the coefficients of regression models. Such a test can be rather simply conducted by comparing a model such as geographically weighted regression (GWR) as an alternative to a standard linear regression, the null hypothesis. In this study however, three spatially autocorrelated regressions are also used as null hypotheses: (i) a simultaneous autoregressive error model; (ii) a moving average error model; and (iii) a simultaneous autoregressive lag model. This expansion of null hypotheses, allows an investigation as to whether the spatial variation in the coefficients obtained using GWR could be attributed to some other spatial process, rather than one depicting non-stationary relationships. The new test is objectively assessed via a simulation experiment that generates data and coefficients with known multivariate spatial properties, all within the spatial setting of the oft-studied Georgia educational attainment data set. By applying the bootstrap test and associated contextual diagnostics to pre-specified, area-based, geographical processes, our study provides a valuable steer to choosing a suitable regression model for a given spatial process.

We derive a generalised version of the isotropy test proposed by Arbia et al. (2013) and analyse its properties in various settings. Expanding on this, we propose a new testing procedure in the frequency domain that allows one to estimate and test under mild conditions any form of anisotropy in homogeneous spatial processes. The power of the test is studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations performed both on regularly and irregularly spaced data. Finally, the method is used to analyse the soybean yields in the US.

A spatiotemporal geostatistical hurdle model approach for short-term deforestation prediction,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.06.003,AUG 2017,33,0,"This paper introduces and tests a geostatistical spatiotemporal hurdle approach for predicting the spatial distribution of future deforestation (one to three years ahead in time). The method accounts for neighborhood effects by modeling the auto-correlation of occurrence and intensity of deforestation, using a spatiotemporal geostatistical specification. Deforestation observations are modeled as a function of pertinent control variables, such as distance to roads and protected areas, and the model accounts for space-time autocorrelated residuals with non-stationary variance. Applied to the Brazilian Amazon, the model predicted the locations of new deforestation events with over 90% agreement. In addition, 100% of the deforestation intensity values were contained in the model's confidence bounds. The features of the model and validation results qualify the model as a strong candidate for short-term deforestation modeling. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Gaussian spatial linear models with repetitions: An application to soybean productivity,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.07.013,AUG 2017,41,0,"Soybean yield in the south region of Brazil was analyzed by using Gaussian spatial linear models to account for the spatial dependence between the observations. Some special cases of Gaussian spatio-temporal linear models were also considered. The data set was collected over five years and we regarded four explanatory variables. Each year was considered to be a realization of the process. We checked the goodness of fit and since we noted the presence of an atypical year with lower productivity than in the other years, we conducted influence diagnostics analysis. Moreover, we considered two appropriate perturbation schemes in the response variable and case weight perturbation. The results showed that the methods were effective for detecting influential observations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Is a matrix exponential specification suitable for the modeling of spatial correlation structures?,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.04.003,MAY 2017,33,1,"This paper investigates the adequacy of the matrix exponential spatial specifications (MESS) as an alternative to the widely used spatial autoregressive models (SAR). To provide as complete a picture as possible, we extend the analysis to all the main spatial models governed by matrix exponentials comparing them with their spatial autoregressive counterparts.

We propose a new implementation of Bayesian parameter estimation for the MESS model with vague prior distributions, which is shown to be precise and computationally efficient. Our implementations also account for spatially lagged regressors. We further allow for location- specific heterogeneity, which we model by including spatial splines. We conclude by comparing the performances of the different model specifications in applications to a real data set and by running simulations. Both the applications and the simulations suggest that the spatial splines are a flexible and efficient way to account for spatial heterogeneities governed by unknown mechanisms.

On the link between natural emergence and manifestation of a fundamental non-Gaussian geostatistical property: Asymmetry,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.01.003,MAY 2017,24,3,"The geostatistical workflow of data analysis, model fitting, and subsequent interpolation or simulation has recently been enhanced by several methods. These methods can be summarized under the terms 'rank-order geostatistics', for the empirical analysis part of the workflow, and 'copula geostatistics', for the theoretical foundation and the modeling (interpolation or simulation). Besides taking into account non-Gaussianity, the main advantage of this alternative way to treat geostatistical problems is the descriptive power and standardized interpretability. This paper addresses the empirical analysis part of the workflow. We investigate the interplay between structural features, statistical properties, and underlying dynamic processes of a realization of a spatial field.

(1) In the first part of this paper we recapitulate and consolidate the advances in the empirical analysis part of the geostatistical workflow and put them into context of 'classical' geostatistics. We place particular emphasis on the theoretical foundation of so called asymmetry functions, because in our opinion they are the necessary first step away from Gaussian geostatistics. (2) In the second part, we rigorously analyze how specific types of structural features are related to the asymmetry of a spatial field. In the geostatistical tradition of interpreting the shape of variograms or correlation functions, we give examples of how to interpret different shapes of the asymmetry function. (3) We subsequently report how dynamic processes naturally lead to the emergence of asymmetrical (non-Gaussian) spatial structures. To demonstrate these findings, we investigate the manifestation of different spatial data sets (land surface elevation, groundwater contamination, grades of an undergraduate exam) and relate the non-Gaussian structural features to the underlying dynamic processes. Numerical process models are utilized to manifest evidence of how realistic processes naturally lead to complex non-Gaussian structures.

The key purpose of this paper is to show that asymmetry is a fundamental geostatistical property and a result of different kinds of spatial processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of different sampling densities on geographically weighted regression kriging for predicting soil organic carbon,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.02.001,MAY 2017,46,1,"Geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK) is a popular interpolation method, considering not only spatial parametric nonstationarity and relationship between target and explanatory variables, but also spatial autocorrelation of residuals. However, little attention has been paid to the effects of different sampling densities on GWRK technique for estimating soil properties. Objectives of this study were: (i) comparing the GWRK predictions with those obtained from multiple linear regression kriging (MLRK) and ordinary kriging (OK), and (ii) examining how different sampling densities affect the performance of GWRK for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC). Soil samples were simulated with four sampling densities, including 0.010, 0.020, 0.041, and 0.082 sites/km(2). The results showed that GWRK made less prediction errors and outperformed MLRK and OK in the case of a high sampling density, with the root mean squared errors of GWRK<MLRK<OK and coefficient of determination of GWRK>MLRK>OK. However, in the case of a low sampling density, GWRK generated larger prediction errors, exhibiting a poorer performance than MLRK and OK. Accordingly, we conclude that GWRK can be considered as the best approach for predicting SOC in these three approaches with sufficient data points, but it has a poorer performance than the other methods with sparse data points.

Spatio-temporal pareto modelling of heavy-tail data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.02.003,MAY 2017,20,2,"In this work we introduce a spatio-temporal process with pareto marginal distributions. Dependence in space and time is introduced through the use of latent variables in a hierarchical fashion. For some specifications the process becomes strictly stationary in space and time. We present the construction of the process and study some of its properties and dependence measures such as correlation and tail dependence. We follow a Bayesian approach to estimate model parameters and show how to obtain posterior inference via MCMC methods. The performance of the process is illustrated with a pollution dataset of monthly maxima ozone concentrations over the metropolitan area of Mexico City. Our results show that our model is in many instances, superior to a couple of alternative models based on the generalized extreme value distribution.

Spatial clustering of curves with an application of satellite data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.01.006,MAY 2017,37,1,"Water quality indicators are important to identify risks to the environment, society and human health. The European Community Water Framework Directive establishes guidelines for the classification of all water bodies across Europe and chemical and biological indicators were used to this scope. In particular, the Chlorophyll type A index (Chl-a) is a shared indicator of trophic status and monitoring activities may be useful to explain its spatial distribution and to discover local dangerous behaviours (for example the anoxic events). Differently by the classical approach based on an ""average'' values over a period, we propose a functional clustering model that takes into account temporal and spatial dependence of Chl-a concentrations in the Adriatic Sea for defining appropriate clusters of sites. We use satellite monthly data, during the period 2002-2012, and we model the spatial dependence among the sites by means of a Markov random field model. Compared to similar attempts in literature by Jiang and Serban (2012) our formulation includes spatial covariates. This inclusion allows for more flexibility to obtain more homogeneous and representative clusters of sites in the Adriatic Sea. The estimation of the model and the identification of the number of clusters are carried out using a pseudolikelihood function. A small simulation study complements the real data analysis.

Small area prediction of counts under a non-stationary spatial model,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.01.004,MAY 2017,36,3,"The re is a growing need for current and reliable counts at small area level. The empirical predictor under a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) is often used for small area estimation (SAE) of such counts. However, the fixed effect parameters of a GLMM are spatially invariant and do not account for the presence of spatial nonstationarity in the population of interest. A geographically weighted regression extension of the GLMM is developed, extending this model to allow for spatial nonstationarity, and SAE based on this spatially nonstationary model (NSGLMM) is described. The empirical predictor for small area counts (NSEP) under an area level NSGLMM is proposed. Analytic and bootstrap approaches to estimating the mean squared error of the NSEP are also developed, and a parametric approach to testing for spatial nonstationarity is described. The approach is illustrated by applying it to a study of poverty mapping using socioeconomic survey data from India. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A Bayesian spatial scan statistic for zero-inflated count data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.01.005,MAY 2017,32,0,"Spatial scan statistics have been widely used in the detection and inference of spatial clusters. An extension to this statistic - the zero-inflated scan - was recently proposed for scenarios where the number of zero counts is greater than that predicted by most usual count models. In this work, we propose an efficient Bayesian spatial scan statistic for zero-inflated binomial data which overcomes computational limitations of previously proposed models set within a frequentist inferential framework. Our methodology is evaluated and compared with the frequentist approach using simulated data. Our simulations show that the performance of the Bayesian version is comparable to that of the frequentist zero-inflated scan. An advantage of the Bayesian approach is that routines can be carried through at a much higher speed; this is important when one considers full integration of the proposed methodology to an online cluster detection mechanism. In order to build an empirical distribution for computing the p-values needed for the decision process involved in the frequentist scan approach, considerable computational effort is expended for running simulations under the null hypothesis. The Bayesian approach does not require such procedure. An application to speeding tickets emissions in Federal District, Brazil, is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Mark variograms for spatio-temporal point processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.02.006,MAY 2017,30,2,"A spatio-temporal point process can be transformed into two marked point processes by taking the times or locations as marks. For these marked point processes mark variograms can be defined, opening a new way for the statistical analysis of spatio-temporal point processes. We present first the theoretical forms of the variograms for some models of spatio-temporal point processes, in order to help understanding empirical variograms. Then we study statistical problems. The used ratio-estimator for the variograms has a form that makes it possible to partially ignore inhomogeneities and edge-effects. Two data examples which were already studied with traditional methods in the point-process literature are reanalysed with the two mark variograms, showing their explorative power.

Modelling spatial heteroskedasticity by volatility modulated moving averages,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.03.006,MAY 2017,30,0,"Spatial heteroskedasticity has been observed in many spatial data applications such as air pollution and vegetation. We propose a model, the volatility modulated moving average, to account for changing variances across space. This stochastic process is driven by Gaussian noise and involves a stochastic volatility field. It is conditionally non-stationary but unconditionally stationary: a useful property for theory and practice. We develop a discrete convolution algorithm as well as a two-step moments-matching estimation method for simulation and inference respectively. These are tested via simulation experiments and the consistency of the estimators is proved under suitable double asymptotics. To illustrate the advantages that this model has over the usual Gaussian moving average or process convolution, sea surface temperature anomaly data from the International Research Institute for Climate and Society are analysed.

On parameter estimation for doubly inhomogeneous cluster point processes,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.03.005,MAY 2017,31,0,"Nowadays, spatial inhomogeneity and clustering are two important features frequently observed in point patterns. These features often reveal heterogeneity of processes/factors involved in the point pattern formation and interaction determining the relative locations of points. Thus, inhomogeneous cluster point processes can be viewed as flexible and relevant models for describing point patterns observed in biology, forestry and economics for example. In this article, we consider cluster point processes with double inhomogeneity in which locations of cluster centers are drawn under an inhomogeneous parametric intensity function and the distribution of clusters is spatially inhomogeneous and depends on a given parametric function. We propose a Bayesian estimation procedure based on an MCMC algorithm to simultaneously estimate inhomogeneity parameters, cluster parameters and cluster centers.

Dynamic spatio-temporal models for spatial data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2017.02.005,MAY 2017,65,0,"Analyzing spatial data often requires modeling dependencies created by a dynamic spatio-temporal data generating process. In many applications, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is used with a random effect to account for spatial dependence and to provide optimal spatial predictions. Location-specific covariates are often included as fixed effects in a GLMM and may be collinear with the spatial random effect, which can negatively affect inference. We propose a dynamic approach to account for spatial dependence that incorporates scientific knowledge of the spatio-temporal data generating process. Our approach relies on a dynamic spatio-temporal model that explicitly incorporates location-specific covariates. We illustrate our approach with a spatially varying ecological diffusion model implemented using a computationally efficient homogenization technique. We apply our model to understand individual-level and location-specific risk factors associated with chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer from Wisconsin, USA and estimate the location the disease was first introduced. We compare our approach to several existing methods that are commonly used in spatial statistics. Our spatio-temporal approach resulted in a higher predictive accuracy when compared to methods based on optimal spatial prediction, obviated confounding among the spatially indexed covariates and the spatial random effect, and provided additional information that will be important for containing disease outbreaks.

A valid parametric test of significance for the average R-2 in redundancy analysis with spatial data,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.11.001,FEB 2017,38,1,"Consider matrices Y and X containing 2-D spatial, continuousquantitative data collected in the same n locations at a given time, to explain p Y-variables (e. g. plant diversity indices) by q X-variables (e. g. soil characteristics) in a redundancy analysis (RDA, n > q + 1); normality and first-order stationarity are tenable assumptions. The studied problem is how to assess with a valid parametric test of significance the `` average R2'' of such an RDA. The proposed solution consists in a modification of the F-test of the literature. In both its numerator and denominator, the degrees of freedom of the modified F-test are effective, i. e. they incorporate the heteroscedasticity and spatial auto-and cross-correlations of the Y-variables. Comparison is made with an extension of the modified F-test for multiple correlation analysis with spatial data, where an effective sample size is used for autocorrelation in the denominator. Theoretical and applied aspects of the tests of significance are presented, with recent computational procedures in multivariate geostatistics, extensive simulation results (156 validity-analysis scenarios), and a real-data example. In summary, the new modified F-test is generally valid, power approaches 1.0 for theoretical coefficient values > 0.1, and the linear model of coregionalization fits the heteroscedasticity and spatial correlations of the Y-variables adequately.

Median Polish Kriging for space-time analysis of precipitation,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.10.003,FEB 2017,25,0,"According to Cressie (1991), the median polish kriging (MPK) is a hybrid method for predicting of spatial data in a two dimensional surface. It combines a kriging interpolator and an analysis of tables. As a result of the effect of a directional trend that models the orographic structure at a specific place, and the periodic temporal character associated with an atmospheric process, such as rainfall, an extension to the number of exploration dimensions is proposed by using median polish in an additive approach, for one temporal and three spatial dimensions (latitude, longitude and altitude). In this sense, after applying an outlier resistant and robust prediction method as the MPK, the stationary on residuals was ideal to estimate the structure covariance function, which was obtained fitting a sum-product model with a spatial exponential effect and a hole-effect without dampening in time. The spatio-temporal modified MPK was used for mapping of monthly precipitation, based on 102 irregularly spaced weather stations from Colombia, for the period 2000-2010. The functional form was adapted to spatial-temporal kriging to create monthly precipitations maps for wettest and driest periods, and a forecast for the rainiest period in the year 2010. Finally, the accuracy of the method was assessed through a cross validation analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

A Moran coefficient-based mixed effects approach to investigate spatially varying relationships,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.12.001,FEB 2017,63,2,"This study develops a spatially varying coefficient model by extending the random effects eigenvector spatial filtering model. The developed model has the following properties: its spatially varying coefficients are defined by a linear combination of the eigenvectors describing the Moran coefficient; each of its coefficients can have a different degree of spatial smoothness; and it yields a variant of a Bayesian spatially varying coefficient model. Moreover, parameter estimation of the model can be executed with a relatively small computational burden. Results of a Monte Carlo simulation reveal that our model outperforms a conventional eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) model and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models in terms of the accuracy of the coefficient estimates and computational time. We empirically apply our model to the hedonic land price analysis of flood hazards in Japan. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Kriging based on areal summary statistics data: Effects of within-unit variability on predictions and uncertainties,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.11.003,FEB 2017,59,0,"Soil data are most commonly available as point-support measurements at known spatial locations. However, several potentially useful databases do not retain precise geographic coordinates, but instead attribute each measurement to some unit (a region or municipality); these data can be summarized by the mean, variance and number of observations by unit. We investigate methods for mapping based on such datasets using methods based on areato- point kriging and the linear mixed model (LMM), so that part of the variation is explained using secondary variables. We compare approaches that (i) account for the within-unit variances of primary and secondary variables, (ii) disregard variance data of the primary variable, (iii) disregard variances of the secondary variables, and (iv) disregard both. The approaches are compared through simulation and synthetic studies, before being applied for a real case study, predicting soil K2O in the French Region Centre based on measurements attributed to municipalities. Results suggest that although approach (i) is best in theory (simulations), it is less robust than approach (iii) in practice (synthetic and real case studies) when certain model assumptions might be violated. We therefore recommend approach (iii) that utilizes within- unit variances of the primary variable, but disregards those of the secondary variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

Model-based inference for small area estimation with sampling weights,SPATIAL STATISTICS,10.1016/j.spasta.2016.09.004,NOV 2016,50,1,"Obtaining reliable estimates about health outcomes for areas or domains where only few to no samples are available is the goal of small area estimation (SAE). Often, we rely on health surveys to obtain information about health outcomes. Such surveys are often characterised by a complex design, stratification, and unequal sampling weights as common features. Hierarchical Bayesian models are well recognised in SAE as a spatial smoothing method, but often ignore the sampling weights that reflect the complex sampling design. In this paper, we focus on data obtained from a health survey where the sampling weights of the sampled individuals are the only information available about the design. We develop a predictive model-based approach to estimate the prevalence of a binary outcome for both the sampled and non-sampled individuals, using hierarchical Bayesian models that take into account the sampling weights. A simulation study is carried out to compare the performance of our proposed method with other established methods. The results indicate that our proposed method achieves great reductions in mean squared error when compared with standard approaches. It performs equally well or better when compared with more elaborate methods when there is a relationship between the responses and the sampling weights. The proposed method is applied to estimate asthma prevalence across districts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
